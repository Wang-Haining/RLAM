The virus has been shown to antagonize the antiviral action of interferon (IFN) by blocking nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes. We found that SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the antiviral action of IFN and may lead to"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1 channels, but the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1 is not completely understood. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa in herbivore feces. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammal species in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species, even pairs of species matched in body size and proportional grass consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption, but that did not necessarily share the same trophic guild. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammal assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This study highlights the importance of using DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet composition and overlap for species-level identification in herbivore dung. This approach will be critical for understanding the role of large mammal herbivores in shaping biodiversity in the future. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

However, the global load of floating plastic debris is still unknown. We show that the global load of floating plastic debris is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This discrepancy is explained by the selective removal of plastic debris larger than 1 mm by the ocean interior. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean.

However, the role of personality traits in the establishment of social hierarchies is poorly understood. Here we show that trait anxiety directly influences social dominance in male outbred rats and identify an important mediating role for mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens. High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low-anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as decreased ATP and increased ROS production in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals. We conclude that mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens is crucial for social hierarchy establishment and is critically involved in the low social competitiveness associated with high anxiety.

In this study, we found that the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis protects cancer cells from ferroptosis through induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. This resistance can be overcome by targeting SREBP1 or by inducing ferroptosis. These findings suggest that targeting the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in combination with ferroptosis induction may be a promising strategy for cancer treatment. This strategy may be particularly effective in cancer cells with mutations in the PI3K pathway, such as in breast and prostate cancers. These results also suggest that ferroptosis may be a useful therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment in patients with PI3K-mutated cancers. Further studies are needed to test this hypothesis in preclinical models and in patients. (Show more)"

Our findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure. Our results also highlight the need for a more holistic approach to forest management that considers the multiple ecosystem services and values provided by forests.

We also found that APOE4 increases the rate of C1q accumulation in hippocampus, which may represent the accumulation of senescent synapses with enhanced vulnerability to complement-mediated neurodegeneration. These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes. They also suggest the hypothesis that APOE4 may be associated with defective phagocytic capacity of astrocytes, accelerating the rate of accumulation of C1q-coated senescent synapses, enhancing synaptic vulnerability to complement-mediated neurodegeneration.

It has been responsible for the deaths of millions of people in Europe during the Second Pandemic (14–19th centuries). The vector of plague is the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which can be transmitted by multiple transmission pathways. Here, we present a model for plague transmission by a human ectoparasite vector. We show that this model fits mortality curves from nine outbreaks in Europe better than models for pneumonic or rodent transmission. Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346–1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats. This study also highlights the importance of vector-borne diseases in the history of medicine. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal cells is not well understood. We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor.

They are also the sites of many cellular processes, such as cell motility. Actin filaments are connected to each other by a protein called cofilin. Cofilin is the master regulator of actin filament disassembly. However, how cofilin does so in a physiological context, where filaments are interconnected and under mechanical stress, remains unclear. Here, we show that cofilin can induce the severing of filaments in a mechanical torque-dependent manner. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of how cells control the dynamics of actin filaments. They also provide a general principle for designing new materials with tunable mechanical properties. This principle can be applied to a wide range of materials, from synthetic polymers to biopolymers. (Show more)"

We demonstrate that RppH decapsulates Np4-capped RNAs by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to decapsulate other RNAs. This enzyme prefers Np4-capped 5′ ends, which it recognizes by a mechanism that results in a one-nucleotide shift in substrate specificity. The unconventional manner in which RppH recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress.

The observations were conducted over Beijing, China, and the results show that the aerosol loading has no discernible effect on the liquid water path. This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation.

We found that BK channels can exhibit slow C-type inactivation/recovery. We propose that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. These findings may help us understand the physiological roles of BK channels.

Whether and how the brain does this remains unknown. Here, we show that the brain responds to each successive word in a sentence with a sudden increase in high-gamma power. This increase is followed by a sudden decrease whenever words can be merged into a phrase. The timing and magnitude of these changes in brain activity are consistent with a merge operation that applies equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity. More superficial models of language, based solely on sequential transition probability over lexical and syntactic categories, only captured activity in the posterior middle temporal gyrus. Formal model comparison indicated that the model of phrase construction provided a better fit than probability-based models at most sites in superior temporal and inferior frontal cortices. Activity in those regions was consistent with a neural implementation of a bottom-up or left-corner parser of the incoming language stream.

We used expert opinion and scientific evidence to identify risk factors for spillover and spread in humans and developed a risk ranking framework and interactive web tool, SpillOver, to estimate the risk of 887 wildlife viruses. We validated the risk assessment using data from virus discovery projects and public records of virus detections around the world. The top 12 ranked viruses were known zoonotic viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Several newly detected viruses ranked higher than known zoonotic viruses. SpillOver is a living, interactive database that can be refined over time to continue to improve the quality and public availability of information on viral threats to human health. The SpillOver platform can be used by policy makers and health scientists to inform research and public health interventions for prevention and rapid control of disease outbreaks."

The color of nectar is often used as an indicator of the reward’s nutritional value, but the color of the nectar of Nesocodon mauritianus has been proposed to be a visual attractant for pollinators. Here, we show that the red color of the nectar is derived from a previously undescribed alkaloid, nesocodin. We identify three enzymes that are necessary or sufficient for the production of the red pigment, and we show that the pigment is attractive to vertebrate pollinators. Our findings suggest that the red color of nectar is a convergent trait, and that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation. This work provides insight into the evolution of a unique and visually attractive reward. (Show more)"

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how HKU4 and HKU5 transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions.

Pol δ is responsible for replicating the lagging strand template and anchors to the PCNA sliding clamp to form a holoenzyme. The stability of this complex is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. We designed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. Surprisingly, the results indicate that human pol δ maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This study provides a unique perspective on the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme and the implications of this stability on DNA replication.

The noninvasive method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period.

Neuroinflammation is also known to be associated with autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Neuroinflammation is mediated by a variety of signaling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) signaling. Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is a MAP3K that has been implicated in neuroinflammation. In this study, we found that ASK1 is involved in the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. We also found that ASK1 is required for the development of neuroinflammation in microglia/macrophages and astrocytes. Our findings suggest that ASK1 is a promising therapeutic target for reducing neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases and autoimmune diseases. This study also provides a rationale for the use of ASK1 inhibitors in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and autoimmune diseases. This article is protected by copyright.

The etiology of autism is so complicated because it involves the effects of variants of several hundred risk genes along with the contribution of environmental factors. Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. Here, we show that the five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility in autism and suggests a potential therapeutic target. (Show more)"

In contrast, a second RSN is subordinated to the disease process. Network functionality was assessed by quantifying the expression of the RSNs during task performance. The results suggest that the organization of the brain is not fixed, but is dynamic and can be modulated by task performance. This approach can be used to assess the organization of the brain in health and disease."

However, the role of FSIP1 in the progression and drug sensitivity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. This article is protected by copyright.

However, the impacts of these two factors are frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we show that the impacts of global warming on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are dependent on the species’ thermal tolerance. We found that as temperatures increased, the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning became steeper, meaning that more species were required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. Our findings have implications for the design of biodiversity conservation strategies and the management of ecosystems under global warming. This article is protected by copyright.

This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner.

These adducts are formed by the photodegradation of the lipofuscin pigment, which is a major component of the RPE. We show that the Fe chelator deferiprone decreases the photooxidation of bisretinoids and the photodegradation of lipofuscin. These findings have implications for the health of the retina and may lead to the development of new strategies for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration. (Read more)"

However, the evolution of specialization is often considered a dead end, as morphological and functional optimizations are expected to occur throughout the organism. Here we show that siphonophores, a group of pelagic predators, can evolve specialization on different prey types, and that these transitions are linked to the evolution of the tentilla, the specialized structures used for prey capture. Our findings contribute to understanding how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs. They also provide insights into the evolution of predator specialization, and the mechanisms that allow predators to diversify their diets. This work contributes to the development of a broader perspective on predatory niche diversification via morphological innovation and evolution."

The study of the hand is complicated by the fact that the hand is the most mobile part of the body and, as a result, is difficult to preserve in the fossil record. We report the discovery of a hominin hand from the Middle Pleistocene of Kenya that preserves a key derived feature of the human hand, the third metacarpal styloid process. This fossil provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of this key derived feature of the human hand. The discovery of this feature in an early hominin suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo. This study also highlights the importance of the fossil record in understanding the evolution of the human hand. (Show more)"

We have developed a small-molecule inhibitor of both human serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) isozymes. We show that this inhibitor is effective in vitro and in vivo, and that it is particularly effective in B-cell malignancies. We also show that one-carbon metabolism is a targetable metabolic deficiency of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Thus, this work provides a metabolic rationale for targeting one-carbon metabolism in cancer. This work also provides a proof-of-concept for a metabolic inhibitor of both SHMT isozymes. This work is a step toward the development of a metabolic inhibitor of SHMT2, which is a promising therapeutic target in cancer. This work also provides a metabolic rationale for targeting one-carbon metabolism in cancer. This work also provides a metabolic rationale for targeting one-carbon metabolism in cancer.

This study shows that deforestation can reduce people’s consumption of fruits and vegetables and thus their vitamin A intake. Conversely, forest fragmentation can increase fruit and vegetable consumption and thus vitamin A intake. These findings have important implications for policy makers, who should consider the role of forests in improving people’s diets and nutrition security. This study also highlights the importance of using causal inference methods to understand the effects of deforestation on people’s diets. This is a first step toward understanding the role of forests in improving people’s diets and nutrition security. Future research should focus on the role of forests in improving people’s diets in other settings."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We hypothesize that the large size of sauropods, the largest terrestrial animals that walked Earth, may have been a key factor in the evolution of fixed foraging trails, which reduced the risk of subsoil compaction. This ecological strategy may have guided the development of the largest animals that ever walked the planet. Our findings have implications for the design of farm machinery and the evolution of the largest animals that ever walked the planet. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
