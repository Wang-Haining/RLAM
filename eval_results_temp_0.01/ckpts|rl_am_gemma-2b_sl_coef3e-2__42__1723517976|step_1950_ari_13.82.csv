In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. (Show more)"

In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. This work is expected to be useful for the design of new antibiotics against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. (Show more)"

Here we show that the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa detects contact with surfaces on short timescales using the mechanical activity of its type IV pili, a major surface adhesin. This mechanosensory system requires attachment of type IV pili to a solid surface, followed by pili retraction and signal transduction through the Chp chemosensory system, a chemotaxis-like sensory system that regulates cAMP production and transcription of hundreds of genes, including key virulence factors. Our results thus support a mechanochemical model where a chemosensory system measures the mechanically induced conformational changes in stretched type IV pili. These findings demonstrate that P. aeruginosa not only uses type IV pili for surface-specific twitching motility, but also as a sensor regulating surface-induced gene expression and pathogenicity. This mechanochemical model of surface sensing may be common to other bacteria and may be important for understanding the evolution of sensing systems in bacteria. It also provides a mechanism for how bacteria can sense the mechanical properties of their environment, which is important for understanding the role of bacteria in health and disease. (Show more)"

However, whether and how the brain does so remains largely unknown. Here, we show that high-gamma power increases with each successive word in a sentence but decreases suddenly whenever words can be merged into a phrase. This pattern of activity is consistent with a merge operation that applies equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity. More superficial models of language, based solely on sequential transition probability over lexical and syntactic categories, only captured activity in the posterior middle temporal gyrus. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases. This model of language processing may be a key to understanding the brain’s efficient representation of the complex structures of natural language."

Moreover, Th17 cells can provide “help” for the development of classic Th1 cells. These results indicate that Th17 cells are potent mediators of colitis pathogenesis by dual mechanisms: by directly transitioning to Th1-like cells and by supporting the development of classic Th1 cells.

We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium.

This allows for the construction of a Crop Condition Index that can be used to monitor crop conditions and predict crop yields earlier and more accurately than official forecasts released midseason. The method can be extended to other crops and countries, and can be used to monitor the impact of climate change on crop conditions.

We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

However, the molecular mechanisms of how alkylation-induced DNA lesions affect the efficiency and accuracy of transcription remain largely unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated the effects of alkylation-induced DNA lesions on transcription. We found that the presence of alkylation-induced DNA lesions can lead to transcriptional stalling, which is dependent on the type of alkylation-induced DNA lesions. Furthermore, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II, which is involved in modulating the translocation of alkylated DNA template after nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion. These findings provide important mechanistic insights into the effects of alkylation-induced DNA lesions on transcription. This work also provides a better understanding of the effects of alkylation-induced DNA lesions on transcription, which is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. We show that the sequential proteolysis of MERS-CoV S proteins is required for infection of human lung-derived cells, but not for infection of other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence.

In Parkinson’s disease, the dominant component of metabolic activity was subordinated to an independent disease-related pattern. Network functionality was assessed by quantifying metabolic RSN expression in cerebral blood flow PET scans acquired at rest and during task performance. In healthy subjects and early PD patients, the dominant metabolic RSN was deactivating during rest, whereas in advanced PD this pattern was partially corrected by dopaminergic therapy. In contrast, in Alzheimer’s disease, significant reductions in network expression were already present at diagnosis, progressing over time.

However, the evolution of predator specialization is often considered a dead end, due to the constraints associated with the evolution of morphological and functional optimizations throughout the organism. Here we show that the evolution of the feeding strategies of the pelagic cnidarian siphonophores is linked to the evolution of their specialized feeding apparatus, and that these changes are not only local but also extend to the rest of the organism. Our findings contribute to understanding how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs. They also provide insights into the evolution of the most extreme cases of predator specialization."

This study provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key derived feature of the human hand, the third metacarpal styloid process, and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo. This finding has implications for the timing of the evolution of the modern human hand and the emergence of the human capacity for tool use. It also provides a unique window into the evolution of the human hand in Africa, a region of the world where the fossil record is particularly rich. (Less)"

We have developed a small-molecule inhibitor of the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), which is a key metabolic enzyme that converts serine to glycine. We have shown that this inhibitor is effective in blocking the growth of colon cancer xenografts in mice. We have also shown that the inhibitor is effective in blocking the growth of lymphoma cell lines, and that this effect is rooted in defective glycine import. Thus, we have identified a metabolic vulnerability of lymphoma cells that can be targeted therapeutically. This work has implications for the treatment of lymphoma, and for the development of new therapeutics for cancer in general."

This study also shows that the presence of forests can lead to an increase in the consumption of fruits and vegetables, and thus to an increase in the vitamin A content of diets. This study has important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. This study also provides evidence that the use of causal inference methods can be used to test hypotheses about the effects of deforestation on people’s diets. This study is an example of how the use of causal inference methods can lead to the development of new insights into the effects of environmental change on people’s lives."

We show that the increase in farm machinery capacity has led to the propagation of subsoil compaction into deeper soil layers, with potential loss of soil productivity. We also show that the total weight of modern farm vehicles is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, suggesting that unconstrained roaming of these giants would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles."
