Here, we report the structure of ice II hydrate, which is a new phase of water with a composition of D2O·Ne·H2O. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The resolved structure is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. This work provides a new perspective on the structure of ice II and its relevance to the origin of life.

Here, we present the first comparative analysis of the genomes of two myxozoans and a cnidarian, and we show that myxozoans are a sister group to the less reduced cnidarian parasite, P. hydriforme. We also show that myxozoan genomes are among the smallest reported in animals and that they are depleted in genes related to development and cell–cell communication. These results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by a reduction in genome size and gene content. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of proton channels, but the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels is not completely understood. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

The architecture is easy to implement, train, and apply in practice, and can be used in a wide range of problems."

Here we present a continuous, first-of-its-kind 1.3-My record of continental hydroclimate and lake-level variability derived from drill core data from Lake Malawi, East Africa (9–15° S). We observe dramatic shifts in effective moisture, resulting in large-scale changes in one of the world’s largest lakes and most diverse freshwater ecosystems. Results show evidence for 24 lake level drops of more than 200 m during the Late Quaternary, including 15 lowstands when water levels were more than 400 m lower than modern. A dramatic shift is observed at the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT), consistent with far-field climate forcing, which separates vastly different hydroclimate regimes before and after ∼800,000 years ago. Before 800 ka, lake levels were lower, indicating a climate drier than today, and water levels changed frequently. Following the MPT high-amplitude lake level variations dominate the record. From"

We also show that APOE is critical for the accumulation of senescent synapses in the brain, which may contribute to AD pathogenesis. These studies suggest that APOE4 may be associated with AD risk in part because of defective synapse pruning by astrocytes. This hypothesis is testable in animal models.

While low humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear.

We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition.

However, whether and how this process unfolds in the brain is unknown. Here, we show that high-gamma power increases with each successive word in a sentence but decreases suddenly whenever words can be merged into a phrase. This merge operation is consistent with a bottom-up or left-corner parser of the incoming language stream. Our results provide initial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases. This process may be essential for language comprehension and may be disrupted in language disorders."

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4.

Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells.

We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. We found that sequential proteolysis of MERS-CoV S proteins is required for efficient infection of human lung-derived cells, but not of other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Therefore, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence. These findings may help to explain the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and may provide targets for therapeutic intervention. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

However, little is known about the impact of deforestation on people’s diets, which are critical for health and well-being. This study shows that deforestation can have a negative impact on people’s diets, which in turn can affect their vitamin A status. This study has important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. This study also highlights the importance of considering the role of natural landscapes in meeting nutrition goals."

We show that the increase in mechanization has led to a significant increase in subsoil compaction, which now exceeds safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We also show that the total weight of modern farm vehicles is now comparable to that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods. This suggests that the effects of modern farm machinery on soil compaction may have been similar to those of sauropods in the past, and that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants.
