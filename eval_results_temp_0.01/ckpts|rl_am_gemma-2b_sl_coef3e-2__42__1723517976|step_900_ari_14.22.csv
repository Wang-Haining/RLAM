In this work, we report the synthesis and structure of neon hydrate, which is the first example of a hydrate with ice II structure. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The resolved structure where Ne dissolved in ice II is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. Our results provide a unique example of a hydrate with ice II structure and a new route to study the structure of ice II. This work also demonstrates the capability of in situ neutron diffraction to study the structure of hydrates. (Show more)"

The evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, and a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we present the first comparative genomic analysis of two distantly related myxozoan species and a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results show that the myxozoan body plan is the result of a dramatic reduction in gene content and that the genome of the Myxozoa is one of the smallest reported in animals. Our findings suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Show more)"

We found that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and interacts with the Nup98-Rae1 complex, which is essential for nuclear import of STAT1 and STAT2. We also show that a simple mutation in Orf6 abolishes its ability to block nuclear import of STAT1 and STAT2, thus providing a proof of concept for the use of this strategy as a target for antiviral therapy.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1, but the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1.

This study quantifies the magnitude of this yield variability and its consequences for global maize production and trade. We find that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields will increase to values much larger than present-day values in most of the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and to a decrease in mean yields. The probability that the top four maize-exporting countries have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming. Our results highlight the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance. They also underscore the importance of global cooperation in climate change mitigation and adaptation."

However, the extent to which species partition food-plant species is largely unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa in herbivore diets. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large herbivores in semiarid African savanna. We found that, despite being similar in body size and proportional grass consumption, species differed in diet composition, and that dietary overlap was sometimes greater between grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.

We show that the global load of floating plastic debris is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. Our observations of the size distribution of floating plastic debris point at important size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

The solar system is the only place in the universe where we can study the formation of the solar system.

The grains have interstellar cosmic ray exposure ages of 3.9 ± 1.6 Ma to ∼3 ± 2 Ga before the start of the Solar System ∼4.6 Ga ago. The grains condensed in outflows of asymptotic giant branch stars &lt;4.9 Ga ago that possibly formed during an episode of enhanced star formation ∼7 Ga ago. The grains acquired the bulk of their cosmogenic nuclides in the interstellar medium and not by exposure to an enhanced particle flux of the early active sun. The results are important for the understanding of the formation of the solar system. They also provide constraints for the formation of the first stars and the first galaxies in the universe.

The effective CPUE of most countries in 2015 was a fifth of its 1950s value, which was compared with a global decline in abundance. There are signs, however, of stabilization and more effective management in recent years, with a reduction in fleet sizes in developed countries. The global fleet could increase by 1 million motorized vessels by midcentury as developing countries continue to transition away from subsistence fisheries. This would challenge sustainable use of fisheries' resources. The expansion of the motorized fleet is driven by the powered-artisanal fleet, which has grown substantially in recent decades. We provide a global reconstruction of the powered-artisanal fleet, which is essential to understand the evolution of the global fishing fleet.

It is regulated by cellular metabolism, redox homeostasis, and various signaling pathways related to cancer. In this study, we found that activating mutation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), highly frequent events in human cancer, confers ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells, and that inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis induction. Mechanistically, this resistance requires sustained activation of mTORC1 and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)C1-dependent induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. Furthermore, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a transcriptional target of SREBP1, mediates the ferroptosis-suppressing activity of SREBP1 by producing monounsaturated fatty acids.

We observe dramatic shifts in effective moisture, resulting in large-scale changes in one of the world’s largest lakes and most diverse freshwater ecosystems. The shift in hydroclimate at the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT) is consistent with far-field climate forcing, which separates vastly different hydroclimate regimes before and after the MPT. The MPT is associated with a dramatic change in the frequency of extreme droughts, which may have contributed to the rapid diversification of the endemic cichlid fish species flock. The hydroclimate variability exerted a profound influence on the Lake Malawi endemic cichlid fish species flock; the geographically extensive habitat reconfiguration provided novel ecological opportunities, enabling new populations to differentiate rapidly to distinct species.

Phylogenomic analyses of these datasets resolved previously controversial beetle relationships, and we found that the origin of beetles and angiosperms coincided with the first appearance of genes encoding enzymes that digest plant cell walls. We propose that these genes enabled efficient digestion of plant tissues, including lignocellulose in cell walls, facilitating the evolution of specialized plant-feeding habits, such as leaf mining and stem and wood boring. Beetle diversity thus appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding plant cell wall-degrading enzymes.

The vector of the disease is the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which can be transmitted by multiple transmission pathways, including the inhalation of infectious droplets by humans and rodents, and the bite of infected fleas by humans and other mammals. Here, we describe a model for plague transmission by a human ectoparasite vector. Using Bayesian inference, we found that this model fits mortality curves from nine outbreaks in Europe better than models for rodent or pneumonic transmission. Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death. This has important implications for the control of the disease."

The present study shows that fructose relative to glucose results in greater brain activation of reward-processing regions and greater hunger and desire for food and food-approach behavior. These findings suggest that fructose may be a stronger appetite suppressant than glucose and may contribute to the high incidence of obesity in the United States. The findings also suggest that the effects of fructose on appetite may be mediated, at least in part, by the brain’s reward system. This may explain why some people are more sensitive to the appetite-suppressing effects of fructose than others. The findings have implications for the development of strategies to combat obesity.

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, HM predicted men’s and women’s support for Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. In addition, HM was associated with less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors. The findings highlight the importance of psychological examinations of masculinity as a cultural ideology to understand how men’s and women’s endorsement of HM legitimizes patriarchal dominance and reinforces gender, race, and class-based hierarchies via candidate support.

The conversion of grasslands to croplands has led to the release of massive amounts of carbon to the atmosphere, but the potential to mitigate this carbon loss through the restoration of grasslands remains largely unexplored.

Our results highlight the potential of grasslands to mitigate climate change and provide a framework for the development of climate-smart agricultural practices. This study provides a unique example of the potential of grasslands to mitigate climate change and highlights the need to restore grasslands to mitigate the effects of agricultural land use change on the global carbon cycle."

We used expert opinion and scientific evidence to identify host, viral, and environmental risk factors contributing to zoonotic virus spillover and spread in humans. We then developed a risk ranking framework and interactive web tool, SpillOver, that estimates a risk score for wildlife-origin viruses, creating a comparative risk assessment of viruses with uncharacterized zoonotic spillover potential alongside those already known to be zoonotic. Using data from a virus discovery project and public records of virus detections around the world, we ranked the spillover potential of 887 wildlife viruses. The top 12 were known zoonotic viruses, and several newly detected viruses ranked higher than known zoonotic viruses. SpillOver is a living, interactive database that can be refined over time to continue to improve the quality and public availability of information on viral threats to human health. We hope that SpillOver will be used by policy makers and health scientists to inform research and public health interventions for prevention and rapid control of disease outbreaks."

We found that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the unique properties of the pol δ holoenzyme and its role in lagging strand DNA synthesis.

In the hypothesized RNA world, before the evolution of proteins, genetic information was stored in RNA molecules that were replicated by ribozymes. In the laboratory, RNA molecules can replicate RNA, but the process is inefficient. Here, we report the results of an in vitro evolution experiment that led to the improvement of the activity of an RNA polymerase ribozyme. The improved polymerase can synthesize a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and, in low yield, even tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR.

Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology.

The source of the parchment used to make these Bibles has been a long-standing controversy. The Latin term abortivum in many sources has led some scholars to suggest that fetal calves or sheep skins were used, but others have argued that it would not be possible to sustain herds if so many Bibles were made from fetal skins. Here, we report a simple and objective method to identify the animal origin of parchment. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals, but did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides. These results suggest that ultrafine parchment does not necessarily derive from the use of abortive or newborn animals with ultrathin hides, but could equally well reflect a production process that allowed the skins of maturing animals of several species to be rendered into vellum of equal quality and fineness.

However, the sign and magnitude of these changes are uncertain, and the potential impacts on the carbon cycle are poorly understood. We quantify the effects of climate and human demography on fire activity and the carbon cycle, using a coupled climate–fire–carbon cycle model. We find that changes in human demography tend to suppress global fire activity, keeping more carbon within terrestrial ecosystems and attenuating warming. However, recent and predicted future reductions in fire activity may enhance land carbon uptake and corresponding to offsetting ∼5 to 10 y of global CO2 emissions at today’s levels. This potentially reduces warming by up to 0.11 °C by 2100. Our study highlights that ignitions and active and passive fire suppression can be as important in driving future fire regimes as changes in climate, although with some risk of more extreme fires regionally and with implications for other ecosystem functions in fire-dependent ecosystems.

However, the conditions under which they are formed are not well understood. The discovery of quasicrystals in the aftermath of the first nuclear test, the “Trinity test,” provides a unique opportunity to study the conditions under which quasicrystals are formed. We report the discovery of a hitherto unknown composition of icosahedral quasicrystal in the glass of the Trinity test, and we show that the discovery of this quasicrystal is itself a product of the extreme conditions of the test."

Photosynthesis relies on these modified tetrapyrroles for the capture of solar radiation and its conversion to chemical energy. The formation of the isocyclic fifth ring, the key reaction in the biosynthesis of (bacterio)chlorophylls, has remained enigmatic for more than 60 y. This reaction is catalyzed by two unrelated enzymes using different chemistries. The majority of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria use O2-sensitive [4Fe-4S] cluster proteins, whereas plants, cyanobacteria, and some phototrophic bacteria possess an O2-dependent enzyme, the major catalytic component of which is a diiron protein. Here, we show that the O2-dependent enzyme is a subunit of the cyclase in oxygenic phototrophs, and that different classes of the enzyme exist based on their requirement for an additional subunit. These data delineate three classes of O2-dependent cyclase in chlorophototrophic organisms from higher plants to bacteria, and their evolution is discussed herein. (Show more)"

Neuroinflammation is also known to be associated with autoimmune diseases, such as EAE. Neuroinflammation is a complex process involving multiple cell types, including microglia, astrocytes, and neurons. Neuroinflammation is also known to be associated with the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) ASK1. In this study, we found that ASK1 plays a major role in the later stage of EAE, suggesting a phase-specific role of ASK1 in neuroinflammation. We also found that ASK1 in microglia/macrophages plays a major role in the generation and maintenance of neuroinflammation, whereas ASK1 in astrocytes plays a major role in the later stage of neuroinflammation. Our findings suggest that ASK1 may be a promising therapeutic target for reducing neuroinflammation. This study may provide a better understanding of the roles of ASK1 in neuroinflammation and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases and autoimmune diseases.

The drought began in 2012 and has led to acute water shortages, groundwater overdraft, critically low streamflow, and enhanced wildfire risk. We find that precipitation deficits that occurred when conditions were warm were more than twice as likely to yield drought years. We also find that although there has not been a substantial change in the probability of either negative or moderately negative precipitation anomalies in recent decades, the occurrence of drought years has been greater in the past two decades than in the preceding century. We conclude that anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of co-occurring warm–dry conditions like those that have created the acute human and ecosystem impacts associated with the “exceptional” 2012–2014 drought in California. Our findings have important implications for water management and climate change adaptation in California and elsewhere.

In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a molecular mechanism for autism and suggests a potential therapeutic target. (Show more)"

Virions must first be cleaved by the spike (S) glycoproteins, which are secreted into the cell cytoplasm, and then be cleaved again to facilitate cell-membrane fusion. We found that the first cleavage steps are important determinants of MERS-CoV virulence, because they expand the cell types that are permissive for infection, and also because they determine the virions’ susceptibility to the host immune system. These findings suggest that the first S cleavage steps may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence."

This interaction is required for optimal viral replication and favors the copackaging of the interacting fragments. Our results indicate that viral RNA fragments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions. The lack of conservation of these interactions might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses.

However, the energy density and the selection of negative electrode materials are significantly limited due to the narrow electrochemical stable potential window of aqueous electrolytes. Herein, a type of a negative electrode material (i.e., LixNb2/7Mo3/7O2) is proposed for high-energy aqueous Li-ion batteries. The unique nanosized and metastable characters of the material are the key to achieve high capacity and low potential without triggering decomposition of water. A full cell consisting of Li1.05Mn1.95O4/Li9/7Nb2/7Mo3/7O2 presents high energy density of 107 W ⋅ h ⋅ kg−1 as the maximum value in 21 m LiTFSA aqueous electrolyte, and 73% in capacity retention is achieved after 2,000 cycles.

These epigenetic differences are associated with glycemia, and high glucose induces similar persistent hypomethylation at one of the differentially methylated loci in vitro. These results support an epigenetic explanation for the metabolic memory of intensive glucose control in people with diabetes.

Here, we show that FSIP1 is highly expressed in TNBC and is associated with poor prognosis. FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. (Less)"

Here, we present a study of an abrupt carbon perturbation and global warming event that occurred during a glacial period. We show that the event was linked to a global warming and anoxia of the deep ocean. We also show that the event was linked to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 and a biodiversity nadir. Our results provide insights into the history of carbon perturbations and the history of global warming. They also provide a case study for the potential impacts of climate change on the deep ocean. This study provides a unique perspective on the history of carbon perturbations and the history of global warming."

We show that RSPO certification reduced deforestation in Indonesia from 2001 to 2015. However, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results suggest that certification may be most effective in reducing deforestation in areas with low forest cover and high fire risk. However, the effectiveness of certification in reducing deforestation in these areas is likely to be limited by the fact that most certified plantations are small and fragmented. Our results also suggest that certification may be most effective in reducing deforestation in areas with low forest cover and high fire risk.

The exocyst complex is composed of 10 subunits, of which the EXO70 subunit is the most important. The function of the exocyst complex is conserved in plants and animals, and its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

In vertebrates, sex is determined by a single locus, resulting in two sexes, or by multiple interacting sex determination alleles, resulting in more than two sexes. Here we investigate the effects of multiple interacting sex determination alleles on the secondary sexual characteristics of a fish, the cichlid Metriaclima mbenjii. We find that the multiple alleles of this fish produce a modular system of sexual polymorphism, where the same genetic locus can produce both sexes and secondary sexual characteristics. This modular system of sexual polymorphism provides context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of the maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations. This work also provides a case study of the effects of sex determination on the evolution of secondary sexual characteristics. (Show more)"

We sought to understand how Fe levels impact the retina, given that retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are also challenged by accumulations of lipid-soluble molecules that are oxidized and degraded by reactive oxygen species. We found that Fe levels in the retina impact the oxidation and degradation of a lipid-soluble molecule that is a component of the bisretinoid signaling system. These findings have implications for the understanding of retinal diseases in which oxidative stress and lipid-soluble molecule accumulation are implicated in disease pathogenesis. They also have implications for the development of therapies that target the oxidation and degradation of lipid-soluble molecules in the retina. (PsycINFO Database Record"

However, the evolution of specialization is often considered a dead end, as morphological and functional optimizations are expected to occur throughout the organism. Here we show that the evolution of specialization in the cnidarian siphonophores is not a dead end, and that specialization can be maintained by the evolution of morphological innovations in separate structures. Our findings contribute to understanding the evolution of specialization in predators, and the role of morphological innovations in the diversification of food webs."

The evolution of the modern human hand is a key area of research, with the emergence of a suite of derived features in the thumb, wrist, and radial carpometacarpal joints being a key evolutionary event. This study provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of this suite in the hominin fossil record. The fossil also provides the earliest evidence for the evolution of a key derived feature of the modern human hand, the third metacarpal styloid process, and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo. This study thus provides a key contribution to our understanding of the evolution of the human hand. (Less)"

We show that this inhibitor blocks colon cancer growth in mice, and that the cancer cells are dependent upon SHMT enzymatic activity for glycine import. Thus, we have identified a metabolic vulnerability of cancer cells that can be exploited therapeutically.

In this study, we show that deforestation over a 5-y period led to a reduction in household fruit and vegetable consumption and thus vitamin A adequacy of diets. Conversely, we found that forest fragmentation led to an increase in consumption of these foods and dietary vitamin A adequacy. This study finds a causal link between deforestation and people’s dietary quality, and the results have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. This study also highlights the importance of using causal inference methods to understand the impacts of deforestation on people’s diets. We believe that this study will be of interest to researchers and policy makers interested in the role of forests in improving people’s diets."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights, which have increased the risks of subsoil compaction. We show that the risks of subsoil compaction have increased over the course of modern mechanization, and that the total area of arable land with chronic subsoil compaction risk now exceeds 20% of the global cropland. We also show that the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, suggesting that unconstrained roaming of these prehistoric giants would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles. Our findings call for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. This may help to mitigate the risks of subsoil compaction and ensure the sustainability of modern agriculture. (Less)"
