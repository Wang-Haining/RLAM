The evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, and a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we present the first comparative analysis of the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species and a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results show that the myxozoan body plan is the result of extreme degeneration of the cnidarian body plan, including a reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insight into the origin of the Myxozoa and the evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic cnidarian. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to block the nuclear import of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are essential for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes. We found that the viral accessory protein Orf6 is responsible for this activity and that it does so by directly interacting with the Nup98-Rae1 complex, which is responsible for the nuclear import of these transcription factors. Our findings provide a mechanism of viral antagonism that could be used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the antiviral action of IFN. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1, but the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1"

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large herbivores in semiarid African savanna. We found that, despite being similar in body size and proportional grass consumption, species differed in diet composition, and that dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages, and that the diversity of large herbivores may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.

This discrepancy is explained by the selective removal of millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic by a combination of processes, including nano-fragmentation, transference to the ocean interior, and ballasting. This study highlights the importance of size-selective sinks in the fate of floating plastic debris, and the need to better understand the processes involved in the global fate of this pollution."

We show that the ability to reproduce is increased by the provision of resources to the mother, and that the greatest increase in reproductive output is in species that practice allonursing. This suggests that the limiting factor in placental mammals is metabolic power rather than resource availability.

In this study, we found that activating mutation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), highly frequent events in human cancer, confers ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells, and that inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis induction. Mechanistically, this resistance requires sustained activation of mTORC1 and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)C1-dependent induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. In conclusion, hyperactive mutation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling protects cancer cells from oxidative stress and ferroptotic death through SREBP1/stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1-mediated lipogenesis, and combination of PI3K-AKT-mTOR inhibition with ferroptosis induction shows therapeutic promise in preclinical models.

The most common drugs for treating hypertension are the voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs), which are associated with a higher risk of heart failure than other antihypertensive drugs. We show that LCCBs activate the STIM/ORAI Ca2+ sensor system, which is up-regulated in hypertension and plays a key role in vascular remodeling. Our findings suggest that LCCBs may promote vascular remodeling in patients with hypertension and may be a potential target for the development of new antihypertensive drugs. This study also provides a rationale for the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated.

We also show that the evolution of brain information-processing capacity is not only different from that of brain size but also different from that of body size. We use the numbers of neurons to reconstruct the evolution of brain information-processing capacity across amniotes and show that the evolution of brain information-processing capacity is not only different from that of brain size but also different from that of body size. This has important implications for studies using relative brain size as a proxy when looking for evolutionary drivers of animal cognition."

TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1 may act as a tumor suppressor in some settings."

This mechanism is critical to the ability of ADF/cofilin to sever highly connected filament networks, which are found in cells. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for how ADF/cofilin can sever actin filaments in a physiological context.

We show that ingestion of fructose relative to glucose results in greater brain activation of reward-processing regions and greater hunger and desire for food and a willingness to give up long-term monetary rewards to obtain immediate high-calorie foods. These findings suggest that fructose may be a stronger appetite suppressant than glucose and may promote feeding behavior. This may help explain the increased prevalence of obesity associated with the consumption of fructose. (PsycINFO Database Record"

The two types of ion-conducting pore gates, one for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other for slow inactivation/recovery, are commonly present in ion channels. The K+ channel BK lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally shows no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. Our findings provide a new perspective on the regulation of ion channels. (Show more)"

This is a major change in our understanding of the invasion process, suggesting that the parasite and host cell are working together to facilitate invasion.

In temperate regions, seasonal influenza outbreaks are associated with decreases in ambient humidity. However, the impact of humidity on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low humidity makes them more susceptible to severe disease following influenza virus challenge. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the impact of ambient humidity on influenza virus infection and disease outcome, and suggest that dry air may be a potential environmental risk factor for seasonal influenza.

This merge operation is consistent with a bottom-up parser that first identifies phrases and then merges them into larger phrases. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases.

These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. In addition, as conceptualized, hegemonic masculinity predicted less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors.

We developed a framework to identify risk factors associated with spillover and used this to rank the spillover potential of 887 wildlife viruses. We validated the framework using data from virus discovery and surveillance efforts, and used this to identify the top 12 ranked viruses. We created a publicly available web tool, SpillOver, that allows users to explore the risk factors associated with spillover and to prioritize the investigation of viruses of greatest concern. SpillOver is a living, interactive database that can be refined over time to continue to improve the quality and public availability of information on viral threats to human health. We hope that SpillOver will be used by policy makers and health scientists to inform research and public health interventions for prevention and rapid control of disease outbreaks."

The color of nectar is an important trait that attracts pollinators, but the mechanisms underlying the production of nectar pigments are poorly understood. We show that the red color of the nectar of Nesocodon mauritianus is derived from a previously undescribed alkaloid, nesocodin. We also identify a second alkaloid in the red nectar of Jaltomata herrerae, a hummingbird-visited species, suggesting that this type of adaptation is convergent. Our findings provide molecular evidence for convergent evolution of a red nectar trait in two vertebrate-pollinated species. This work also identifies a limited number of compounds that are likely to underlie this type of adaptation. This work contributes to our understanding of the evolution of nectar chemistry and its role in plant–pollinator interactions. (Show more)"

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how HKU4 and HKU5 transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results suggest that MERS-CoV, but not HKU4, has adapted to use human cells for cross-species transmission.

We developed unique kinetic assays to measure the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. We found that the holoenzyme is not very processive and is very unstable. These results have profound implications for the synthesis of the lagging strand in humans as they limit the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promote the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. Our results also suggest that the human pol δ holoenzyme is more similar to the S. cerevisiae holoenzyme than previously thought.

However, the role of RORα in the intestinal inflammation remains unclear. Here, we report that RORα/histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3)-mediated attenuation of NF-κB signaling controls the balance of inflammatory responses, and therapeutic strategies targeting this epigenetic regulation could be beneficial to the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, including IBD. Our study provides insights into the role of RORα in intestinal inflammation and suggests a potential therapeutic target for IBD. (Show more)"

We attribute this increase to anthropogenic warming, which has increased the probability of dry precipitation years being also warm. This finding has important implications for water management, ecosystem management, and climate adaptation planning in California and elsewhere. It also has implications for the interpretation of climate model results, which have been used to argue that anthropogenic warming has not increased the probability of co-occurring warm and dry conditions.

The etiology of ASD is so complicated because it involves the effects of variants of several hundred risk genes along with the contribution of environmental factors. Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. Here, we show that the reversal-learning task, which is a behavioral measure of behavioral flexibility, is a converging target of the autism-risk genes. These autism-risk genes all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. The reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for ASD-risk genes. This study provides a molecular mechanism for the convergence of autism-risk genes and may facilitate the identification of the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms.

Rather, the inclusion bodies in ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

In this study, we show that the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis is driven by altered nutrient cycling during heat stress. We demonstrate that the metabolic energy demand of the coral host increases during heat stress, which is compensated by the degradation of amino acids. This shift from uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont subsequently promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host. Our results provide a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

Here we show that the impacts of global warming on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are dependent on the thermal tolerance of species. We found that as temperatures shifted from ambient conditions, the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning became steeper, meaning that more species were required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function.

We further show that host-synthesized FT signals are able to move into dodder stems, where they physically interact with a dodder transcription factor to activate dodder flowering. This study demonstrates that FTs can function as an important interplant flowering signal in host–dodder interactions. The unique means of flowering regulation of dodder illustrates how regressive evolution, commonly found in parasites, may facilitate the physiological synchronization of parasite and host, here allowing the C. australis parasite to time reproduction exactly with that of their hosts, likely optimizing parasite fitness.

These processes are accelerated by the presence of iron, which is a key component of the photooxidized molecules. We show that the presence of iron in the retina promotes the photooxidation and degradation of a class of molecules that are important for the maintenance of photoreceptor cell health. These findings have implications for the understanding of retinal diseases in which iron accumulation is a feature. They also have implications for the development of therapeutic strategies to reduce the oxidative damage and degradation of lipids in the retina. (PsycINFO Database Record"

However, the evolution of predator specialization is often considered a dead end, as morphological and functional optimizations are expected to be lost in the process. Here we show that siphonophores, a group of pelagic predators, can evolve into generalists, and that specialists on one prey type can evolve into specialists on other prey types. These findings help to understand the evolution of predator specialization, and the role of morphological evolution in the diversification of food webs."

This study provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key derived feature of the human hand, the third metacarpal styloid process, in a Middle Pleistocene hominin from East Africa. This fossil suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato. This finding is important for understanding the evolution of the human hand and the emergence of modern human-like tool use. It also has implications for the evolution of the human hand in the context of the origins of modern humans. (Show more)"

We have developed a small-molecule dual inhibitor of human serine hydroxymethyltransferse 1/2, which blocks tumor growth in a colon cancer xenograft model. We have also identified a glycine import defect in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a cancer type that is particularly sensitive to SHMT inhibition. These findings provide a rationale for the development of SHMT inhibitors as a class of cancer therapeutics. They also suggest that targeting the one-carbon unit may be a promising strategy for the treatment of lymphoma. This strategy is distinct from the folate pathway, which is defective in many cancers. Thus, the SHMT pathway may be a promising target for the treatment of cancers that are resistant to the folate pathway. This is an important advance in the development of cancer therapeutics.

This study shows that deforestation can reduce people’s consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are important sources of micronutrients. The results also show that forest fragmentation can increase people’s consumption of fruits and vegetables, which is a positive finding. The findings have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. This study also highlights the importance of using a causal inference approach to study the effects of deforestation on people’s diets. This is a relatively new approach in the field of nutrition and environmental research. We believe that it will become increasingly important in the future. (PsycINFO Database Record"

This has led to the propagation of subsoil compaction into deeper soil layers, with potential loss of soil productivity. We show that subsoil compaction is now a global phenomenon, affecting 20% of arable land, and that the weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest land animals. This raises the question of whether prehistoric animals, such as sauropods, would have been able to roam freely over the landscape, as they did in the past, or whether they would have been constrained by the effects of subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that the roaming of sauropods would have been constrained by the effects of subsoil compaction, and that this may have guided their ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails. This may have been a key factor in the success of sauropods in their habitat. (Show more)"
