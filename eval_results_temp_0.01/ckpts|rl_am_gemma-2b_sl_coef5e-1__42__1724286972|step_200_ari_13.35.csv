Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. To gain insight into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite, we compared the transcriptome and genome of two distantly related myxozoan species to the transcriptome and genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content.

Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1.

Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.

This is due to size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean. We provide a global map of the distribution of floating plastic debris in the open ocean.

A Threonine to Alanine substitution at this position was studied in three representative members of the K+-channel family. Interestingly, all of the mutant channels exhibited lack of C-type inactivation gating and an inversion of their allosteric coupling (i.e., closing of the activation gate collapses the channel’s selectivity filter).

A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals.

The hemoglobin expression pattern in human erythrocytes is highly dynamic during development and in response to environmental cues. Here we show that the insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) is expressed in human erythroid tissues and is down-regulated during development. IGF2BP1 silencing in adult erythroid tissues causes a nearly complete reversal of the adult hemoglobin expression pattern toward a more fetal-like phenotype.

This resistance is mediated by activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis, which, in turn, activates sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. We show that inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis induction, and that this sensitizing effect is mediated by suppression of SREBP1-dependent lipogenesis. Furthermore, we show that SREBP1-mediated lipogenesis is required for the ferroptosis-suppressing activity of cancer cells in vivo. These findings suggest that targeting the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis may be a promising strategy for overcoming ferroptosis resistance in cancer. Copyright © 2017. Published by Elsevier Inc."

Using Bayesian inference, we found that this model fits mortality curves from nine outbreaks in Europe better than models for rodent or pneumonic transmission. Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346–1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats. This study also provides a framework for future studies on the role of human ectoparasites in the spread of other infectious diseases. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc."

However, the evolution of brain neuronal density is still poorly understood. We present a comprehensive dataset of neuron numbers in amniotes and use it to reconstruct the evolution of brain neuronal density. We show that reptiles have not only small brains relative to body size but also low neuronal densities, resulting in average neuron numbers over 20 times lower than those in birds and mammals of similar body size. Amniote brain evolution is characterized by the following four major shifts in neuron–brain scaling. The most dramatic increases in brain neurons occurred independently with the appearance of birds and mammals, resulting in convergent neuron scaling in the two endothermic lineages. The other two major increases in the number of neurons happened in core land birds and anthropoid primates, which are two groups known for their cognitive prowess. Interestingly, relative brain size is associated with relative neuronal cell density in reptiles, birds, and primates but not in other mammals. This has important implications for studies using relative brain size as a proxy when looking for evolutionary drivers of animal cognition. Our results suggest that the evolution of brain neuronal density is a key factor in the rise of complex cognition. Copyright ©"

However, the utility of TRAP1 inhibitors as probes of TRAP1 function is limited by the fact that they cannot distinguish between TRAP1 and HSP90. We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor.

We find a common Bantu and Austronesian descent for all Malagasy individuals. We also find that the settlement of Madagascar happened recently, with a few centuries being sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the settlement was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, there are geographic influences on the present genomic diversity, independent of the admixture, showing that a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. This study provides a unique view of the settlement history of Madagascar. It also provides a tool to study the impact of human activities on the biodiversity of Madagascar. Copyright © 2016.

Here, we show that the RNA pyrophosphohydrolase RppH, which is inactivated by the very conditions of disulfide stress that enable Np4-capped RNAs to accumulate to high levels, is the predominant decapping enzyme in Escherichia coli cells experiencing such stress. Unexpectedly, this enzyme recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5′ termini, resulting in a one-nucleotide shift in substrate specificity. The unconventional manner in which RppH recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress.

We found that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation.

However, the early history of plague is poorly understood, and the available data are limited to a few genomes. Here, we present 17 Y. pestis genomes from the Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age period across Eurasia, which allowed us to explore the diversity of this pathogen during its formative years. Our results reveal a nonflea-adapted and potentially extinct lineage that persisted over millennia without significant parallel diversification, accompanied by rapid dispersal across continents. We also discover the presence of the flea-adapted form of plague in Bronze Age Iberia, previously only identified in the Caucasus and the Volga regions, suggesting a much wider geographic spread of this form of plague. Together, these data reveal the dynamic nature of plague’s formative years in terms of its early evolution and ecology. This information is critical for understanding the origins of plague and its impact on human history. Copyright © 2016. Published by Elsevier Inc."

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, in the days (Studies 1 and 2) and months (Studies 3 through 6) following the 2016 American presidential election, women’s and men’s endorsement of HM predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. In addition, as conceptualized, HM was associated with less trust in the government (Study 3), more sexism (Study 4), more racism (Study 5), and more xenophobia (Study 6) but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how HKU4 and HKU5 transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4.

The stability of this complex is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. We designed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. Surprisingly, the results indicate that human pol δ maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion.

Here, we report the results of an in vitro evolution experiment that improved the activity of an RNA polymerase ribozyme. The improved polymerase ribozyme can synthesize a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR.

Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods.

We report that HIF-dependent expression of the m6A demethylase AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5) increases the proportion of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. ALKBH5 expression is induced by hypoxia, and ALKBH5-dependent NANOG mRNA demethylation increases NANOG mRNA levels, which in turn increases the proportion of BCSCs. Thus, ALKBH5 expression in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment promotes BCSC enrichment. Our findings suggest that ALKBH5 may be a therapeutic target for breast cancer. Copyright © 2015.

Here, we show that the squid Euprymna scolopes regulates the activities of its luminescent symbiont Vibrio fischeri through the strategic provision of a single glycan, chitin. Chitin is released by host hemocytes in the late afternoon, when the squid is preparing to produce light. Chitin catabolism by the symbionts is required for a periodic acidification of the host crypts, which increases the level of oxygen available to the symbionts and enhances their capacity to produce light at night. This glycan-nutrient provision may be a general strategy used by animals to regulate the activities of their associated microbes. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc."

This pandemic is generally understood as the consequence of a singular introduction of Yersinia pestis, after which the disease established itself in European rodents over four centuries. To locate these putative plague reservoirs, we studied the climate fluctuations that preceded regional plague epidemics, based on a dataset of 7,711 georeferenced historical plague outbreaks and 15 annually resolved tree-ring records from Europe and Asia.

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation. We also found that AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA. These results demonstrate that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

We use a high-resolution large ensemble to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the probability of occurrence of multiyear rainfall deficits in past and future decades. We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% by the year 2100 under an intermediate-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5 [SSP2-4.5]) and to 80% under a high-emission scenario (SSP5-8.5). These results highlight the strong sensitivity of the drought risk in SSA to future anthropogenic emissions. Our results also highlight the importance of regional climate models in the assessment of anthropogenic climate change. Copyright © 2017. Published by Elsevier Inc.

It represents the oldest extant anthropogenic quasicrystal currently known, with the distinctive property that its precise time of creation is indelibly etched in history. Like the naturally formed quasicrystals found in the Khatyrka meteorite and experimental shock syntheses of quasicrystals, the anthropogenic quasicrystals in red trinitite demonstrate that transient extreme pressure–temperature conditions are suitable for the synthesis of quasicrystals and for the discovery of new quasicrystal-forming systems.

However, the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms of ASK1 in neuroinflammation remain unknown. In this study, we found that ASK1 in microglia/macrophages plays a major role in neuroinflammation, and ASK1 deficiency in microglia/macrophages ameliorated EAE.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility in autism and suggests a potential therapeutic target. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc."

We show that aggregates accumulate at synaptic terminals and progressively spread throughout the brain. These aggregates are internalized and accumulate within other neurons. We demonstrate that the release of aggregates requires N-ethylmalemide–sensitive fusion protein 1, indicating that active release and uptake of aggregates are important elements of spreading and disease progression.

However, the mechanisms that facilitate virus spillover from bats to other animals and humans are largely unknown. Here, we identified and characterized a highly concentrated immunosuppressant protein (MTX) in the submandibular salivary gland of bats. MTX selectively inhibits the epoxide hydrolase function of leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) to inhibit LTA4 hydrolysis and the generation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a potent lipid chemoattractant for host defense against infection. MTX potently inhibited proinflammatory proteases to induce immune tolerance and maintain high stability. In mouse models, influenza A virus (IAV) infection and pathogenicity were exacerbated by MTX but were reversed by interfering with the effects of MTX on LTA4H or exogenous LTB4 administration.

Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions in ALS are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. To explain the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in the brain and spinal cord, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis remain unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We found that pol II stalling at O2-EtdT and N3-EtdT sites is exacerbated by TFIIS-stimulated proofreading activity. We also identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop). The Pro-Gate loop faces toward the minor groove of RNA:DNA hybrid and is involved in modulating the translocation of minor-groove alkylated DNA template after nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion. Taken together, this work provides important mechanistic insights into transcriptional stalling, lesion bypass, and mutagenesis of alkylated DNA lesions. Copyright © 2015.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas the more rigid uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into"

We find that each oncogene has somewhat different surfaceomes, but the functions of these proteins are harmonized by common biological themes including up-regulation of nutrient transporters, down-regulation of adhesion molecules and tumor suppressing phosphatases, and alteration in immune modulators. Addition of a potent MEK inhibitor that blocks MAPK signaling brings each oncogene-induced surfaceome back to a common state reflecting the strong dependence of the oncogene on the MAPK pathway to propagate signaling. Cell surface protein capture is mediated by covalent tagging of surface glycans, yet current methods do not afford sequencing of intact glycopeptides.

The volcanic eruptions and climate changes are similar to those associated with modern ozone depletion over Antarctica, and the timing is consistent with a role for stratospheric ozone depletion in Southern Hemisphere climate changes. The Mount Takahe eruptions and the associated climate changes provide a unique window into the past for studying the impacts of stratospheric ozone depletion. Copyright © 2016.

We provide a global map of riverine fisheries, which reveals that 90% of global catch comes from river basins with above-average stress levels. We also find that freshwater fisheries provide the equivalent of all dietary animal protein for 158 million people, highlighting the importance of inland fisheries in providing locally sourced, low-cost protein. Our analysis also reveals that fishing pressure is most intense in rivers where potential impacts on biodiversity are highest. This syndrome of poverty, nutritional deficiency, fishery dependence, and extrinsic threats to biodiverse river ecosystems underscores the high stakes for improving fishery management.

We also identify a form of endogenous activity-dependent ectopic axon outgrowth in the same neuron type that is triggered by sensory activity and is dependent on DLK-1/DLK. These findings suggest that DLK-independent regeneration is a powerful platform for gene discovery in neuronal regeneration and may provide a mechanism for regeneration in the mammalian CNS.

Fibrous sheath interacting protein 1 (FSIP1) is a cancer antigen expressed in the majority of TNBCs. However, the role of FSIP1 in TNBC progression and drug sensitivity has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. Copyright © 2015.

However, these factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we investigate how changes in temperature affect the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We found that changes in temperature systematically altered the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures departed from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increased, meaning that more species were required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function.

In the United States, the majority of nutrient pollution comes from small watersheds that drain into large water bodies. However, most monitoring and regulatory efforts have focused on large watersheds, leaving small watersheds largely unmonitored. We used a snapshot of nutrient inputs from nearly all watersheds of Lake Michigan to determine how land cover and dams alter nutrient inputs across watershed sizes. We found that small watersheds can be important sources of coastal nutrient pollution. Although they represent only a modest proportion of lake-wide loads, expanding nutrient management efforts to address smaller watersheds could reduce the ecological impacts of nutrient loading on valuable nearshore ecosystems. Our findings suggest that small watersheds may be a critical link between land use and coastal eutrophication. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc."

We find that the long-time dynamics of such systems are biased toward states that exhibit a fine-tuned extremization of environmental forcing. This behavior is reminiscent of the “fine-tuning problem” in cosmology, where the rare combination of initial conditions that led to the observed universe is biased toward a fine-tuned extremization of the cosmological constant. Our results suggest that the fine-tuning problem may be more general, and may apply to a wide range of systems that are far from equilibrium."

Here we show that NMDAR-Abs change the intrinsic properties of cortical microcircuits to alter the spectral composition of spontaneous EEG activity and predispose brain dynamics to paroxysmal abnormalities. These findings offer mechanistic insights into circuit-level dysfunction induced by NMDAR-Abs. They also provide a framework for understanding the effects of other pathogenic antibodies on brain function. This work may also have implications for other autoimmune diseases in which antibodies disrupt synaptic function. Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Here, we present a multiproxy study of an abrupt warming event that occurred during a global cooling event. We show that the event was linked to an injection of organic matter–derived carbon and anoxia. Earth system modeling indicates that the warming was linked to enhanced nutrient fluxes and thermocline stratification. This study provides insights into the history of abrupt warming events and their potential impacts on the Earth system. It also provides a case study for the use of multiproxy and modeling approaches to investigate abrupt warming events. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

However, the impact of certification on deforestation and fire remains unclear. We use a unique dataset of oil palm plantations in Indonesia to evaluate the impact of certification on deforestation and fire. We find that certification reduced deforestation by 33% from a counterfactual of 9.8 to 6.6% y−1. However, most plantations contained little residual forest when they received certification. As a result, certified areas held less than 1% of forests remaining within Indonesian oil palm plantations in 2015. Certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation.

Dysfunction of the exocyst complex is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and offers a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc."

In vertebrates, sex determination is often regulated by a single locus, which can result in two sexes, three sexes, or more. In contrast, species with polygenic sex determination have multiple alleles segregating within a single species, allowing for more than two genotypic sexes. Here we investigate the effects of polygenic sex determination on secondary sexual characteristics in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii. We find that polygenic sex determination can produce modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics, including genital morphology, craniofacial morphology, gastrointestinal morphology, and home tank behaviors. These results provide context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations. Understanding the evolutionary consequences of sex determination alleles is critical for predicting the effects of anthropogenic change on species diversity. Copyright © 2015.

We sought to understand how Fe levels impact the retina, given that retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are also challenged by accumulations of bisretinoids that photogenerate reactive oxygen species and photodecompose into damaging aldehyde- and dicarbonyl-bearing species. We found that Fe levels impact the retina in a bisretinoid-dependent manner. We also identified a mechanism by which Fe promotes bisretinoid oxidation and degradation. This finding has implications for the development of therapeutic strategies to protect the retina from photodamage. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc."

They are a diverse group of animals that includes both specialists and generalists. We show that siphonophore specialization is not a dead end, and that siphonophore specialists can evolve into specialists on other prey types. We also show that the evolution of siphonophore tentacles is strongly linked to prey type. These findings help us understand how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs."

The fossil record of the hominin lineage shows that the human hand evolved through a series of steps, culminating in the modern hand. The fossil record also shows that the human hand has remained relatively stable over the past 2 Mya. We report the discovery of a hominin hand fossil from 1.42 Mya that shows a key derived feature of the human hand, the third metacarpal styloid process. This fossil provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of this key derived feature of the human hand. The fossil also suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo.

We have identified a metabolic vulnerability of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), a cancer type with poor prognosis. DLBCL cells are dependent upon serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) enzymatic activity to meet glycine demand. We have identified a small-molecule inhibitor of SHMT that is effective in vivo. This inhibitor is also effective in a cell-line screen, but is more cytotoxic in a cancer cell-line screen. This differential sensitivity is rooted in defective glycine import in DLBCL cell lines. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic vulnerability of DLBCL. This work provides a metabolic vulnerability of DLBCL that can be exploited to treat this cancer. It also provides a scaffold for the design of small-molecule inhibitors of SHMT. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc."

We find that deforestation in rural Tanzania led to a reduction in fruit and vegetable consumption and thus vitamin A adequacy of diets. Conversely, we found that forest fragmentation led to an increase in fruit and vegetable consumption and dietary vitamin A adequacy. This study has important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. Our findings suggest that strategies to improve nutrition should consider the role of natural landscapes such as forests in meeting nutrition goals. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants.
