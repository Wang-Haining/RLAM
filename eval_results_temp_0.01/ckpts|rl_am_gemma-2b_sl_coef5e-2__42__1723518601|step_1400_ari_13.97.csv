It is generally believed that the structure of ice II is a result of the enclathration of a guest molecule, such as CO2, into the channels of water molecules. However, the structure of ice II with a guest molecule is not the same as that of the hydrate with a guest molecule. In this work, we demonstrate that neon, a noble gas, can be enclathrated in water molecules to form a hydrate with a structure similar to that of ice II. This work provides a new perspective on the structure of ice II. It also provides a new route to study the structure of ice II by using a guest molecule. This work is expected to be of interest to researchers in the fields of chemistry, physics, and materials science."

In this paper we provide a purely categorical approach to the foundations of quantum theory. The approach is based on a set of axioms that are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. The axioms are designed to guarantee that the category of Hilbert spaces and bounded linear operators is equivalent to the category of continuous linear operators between categories of probability spaces. The approach provides a framework for the study of the foundations of quantum theory that is independent of any particular mathematical structure.

Although the evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species and a cnidarian species, and we show that the myxozoan body plan is the result of extreme genome reduction. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Abridged)"

The SARS-CoV-2 virus is able to evade the host immune response by blocking the nuclear import of transcription factors that are essential for the induction of antiviral genes. In this study, we show that the viral accessory protein Orf6 is able to block nuclear import of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are essential for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes. Our results reveal a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. Our findings provide a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the host immune response and could lead to the development of new antiviral strategies.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. Sperm cells are quiescent in the male reproductive system due to Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1 channels, but become active once introduced into the low-Zn2+-concentration environment of the female reproductive tract. How Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future"

Here, we quantify how the variability of maize yields will change in the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. Our results show that the probability of simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year increases to 86% under 4 °C warming, and that the instability of global grain trade and international grain prices will increase.

However, despite decades of research, we still do not understand how these species partition resources to avoid competition and achieve coexistence. We show that DNA metabarcoding can be used to quantify diet composition at a species level, and that this approach can reveal that even closely related species of large herbivores partition food resources in ways that are not easily predicted from their body size or digestive physiology. These results suggest that the coexistence of many species of large herbivores may be more linked to plant diversity than previously thought. This may have implications for the management of large herbivore populations in a changing world."

Computational approaches are essential tools to this end since their application enables fast and early strategical decisions in the drug development process. Here, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. This work is expected to be useful for the development of new antibiotics. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

To achieve accurate results in practice, a large number of trainable parameters are often required. Here, we introduce a network architecture based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice, and automatically adapts to different problems. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data."

Our results show that the origin of beetles coincided with the evolution of genes encoding enzymes that digest plant cell walls, and that this led to the diversification of beetles. This suggests that the evolution of beetles was driven by multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms, and the adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding plant cell wall-degrading enzymes.

The presence of two copies of the E4 allele increases risk by ∼12-fold whereas E2 allele is associated with an ∼twofold decreased risk for AD. These data put APOE central to AD pathophysiology, but it is not yet clear how APOE alleles modify AD risk. Here, we report a novel role for APOE in controlling the phagocytic capacity of astrocytes that is highly dependent on APOE isoform. They also suggest the hypothesis that AD susceptibility of APOE4 may originate in part from defective phagocytic capacity of astrocytes which accelerates the rate of accumulation of senescent synapses, enhancing synaptic vulnerability to classical-complement-cascade mediated neurodegeneration."

However, the settlement history of Madagascar is still debated. We used a grid-based approach to sample the genomic diversity across Madagascar, and we found that the Malagasy population is a mixture of Bantu and Austronesian populations, with a limited contribution from Europe and the Middle East. We also found that the settlement of Madagascar happened in a sex-biased and geographically heterogeneous way, suggesting that the settlement of Madagascar was the result of multiple independent colonization events. Finally, we found that a few centuries are sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. This study provides a better understanding of the settlement history of Madagascar and will help to improve the conservation of the biodiversity of the island. This article is protected by copyright.

Here we demonstrate that the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa detects contact with surfaces on short timescales using the mechanical activity of its type IV pili, a major surface adhesin. This signal transduction mechanism requires attachment of type IV pili to a solid surface, followed by pilus retraction and signal transduction through the Chp chemosensory system, a chemotaxis-like sensory system that regulates cAMP production and transcription of hundreds of genes, including key virulence factors. Like other chemotaxis pathways, pili-mediated surface sensing results in a transient response amplified by a positive feedback that increases type IV pili activity, thereby promoting long-term surface attachment that can stimulate additional virulence and biofilm-inducing pathways. The methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein-like chemosensor PilJ directly interacts with the major pilin subunit PilA. Our results thus support a mechanochemical model where a chemosensory system measures the mechanically induced conformational changes in stretched type IV pili. These findings demonstrate that P. aeruginosa not only uses type IV pili for surface-specific twitching motility, but also as a sensor regulating"

This activity is required for the rapid degradation of Np4-capped RNAs, which are otherwise protected from decay. The unique manner in which Np4-capped 5′ ends bind to the active site of RppH positions the δ-phosphate, rather than the β-phosphate, for hydrolytic attack, generating triphosphorylated RNA as the primary product of decapping. This deprotection mechanism is required to produce the monophosphorylated 5′ terminus needed to stimulate rapid RNA degradation.

However, the complexity of ACI makes it difficult to be well represented in current climate models. The main reason is that the observational capability is inadequate. To overcome this conundrum, we introduce the dual-field-of-view (FOV) high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) for simultaneously profiling aerosol and water cloud properties, especially water cloud microphysical properties. This instrument, verified by the Monte Carlo simulation and coincident observations of other techniques, was used to conduct a case study over Beijing. The observations show that the increased aerosol loading led to increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius, which is consistent with expectations. However, the aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI.

The parasite, Plasmodium, uses a variety of mechanisms to invade the red blood cell (RBC) and cause disease. Here, we show that the parasite erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 (EBA175) alters the biophysical properties of the RBC, reducing the energy barrier to invasion. This is a major change in our understanding of malaria invasion, suggesting that it is a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces working together to facilitate entry.

Here, we show that the brain’s activity increases with each successive word in a sentence, but suddenly increases whenever words can be merged into a phrase. This suggests that the brain applies a merge operation to the incoming language stream, which is consistent with a neural implementation of a bottom-up or left-corner parser. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases.

The causes of obesity are complex, but one of the most important factors is the ability to overeat. Here we report on a brain circuit that may contribute to this phenomenon. We show that electrical stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus, a brain region that is important in the regulation of feeding, causes rapid and vigorous eating in sated animals. We also show that this circuit is dependent on dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area and dopamine neurons in the brainstem, but not on dopamine neurons in the nucleus accumbens, a brain region that is important in the reward aspects of eating. Thus, we present a characterization of a brain circuit that may promote overeating and contribute to obesity.

The use of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in agriculture is a promising strategy to increase the efficiency of nitrogen use and to reduce the use of chemical fertilizers. However, the use of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in agriculture is limited by the fact that the bacteria are not able to fix nitrogen when they are not in contact with the host plant. Here, we report the development of a synthetic plant-controlled symbiosis in which the nitrogen-fixing bacteria are only able to fix nitrogen when in contact with the desired host plant. This work represents a key milestone toward the development of a synthetic plant-controlled symbiosis in which the bacteria fix nitrogen only when in contact with the desired host plant and are prevented from interaction with nontarget plant species.

In humans, the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is much lower, and it is thought that this is due to the lack of a recycling mechanism. We show that the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme in humans is not due to a lack of recycling, but rather due to a loose association with the PCNA sliding clamp."

The improved ribozyme can replicate RNA, amplify RNA templates, and synthesize a variety of functional RNA molecules. This work provides a foundation for the study of the origin of life in the laboratory. It also provides a powerful tool for the study of RNA biology in general."

There is an urgent need for novel and more efficient therapies, ideally targeting AML stem cells that are essential for maintaining the disease. We show here that monoclonal antibodies targeting the IL1RAP (IL1R3) receptor have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The island is located ∼400 km from the east coast of Africa, but its human history is very different from that of the rest of Africa. We used a grid-based approach to sample the genomic diversity across Madagascar, and we found that the island has been settled by a mixture of people from Africa and Asia, with a recent settlement of Madagascar from Africa. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the settlement was not homogeneous, suggesting that the settlement was not a single event but rather happened in several independent waves. In addition, we found that a few centuries are sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. This study provides a better understanding of the human history of Madagascar.

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA. Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete. This work provides insight into the regulation of carbon utilization in bacteria. It also"

We also show that the survey exhibits long-term stability and can be used to monitor crop status and provide earlier and more precise predictions of crop yields than official USDA forecasts released midseason.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

The band structures of the 2D photonic crystals are predicted to produce unconventional atom–light interaction behaviors, including anisotropic emission, suppressed spontaneous decay, and photon-mediated atom–atom interactions controlled by the position of the atomic array relative to the photonic crystal. An optical conveyor technique is presented for continuously loading atoms into the desired trapping positions with optimal coupling to the photonic crystal. The device configuration also enables application of optical tweezers for controlled placement of atoms. Devices can be fabricated reliably from a 200-nm silicon nitride device layer using a lithography-based process, producing predicted optical properties in transmission and reflection measurements. These 2D photonic crystal devices can be readily deployed to experiments for many-body physics with neutral atoms and engineering of exotic quantum matter."

Here we propose a mechanism that supports this process. Information is stored in the form of changes in the excitability of neural populations. These changes are adaptive and can be accessed directly without the need for cued retrieval. This mechanism is sensitive to context and serial order which makes it suitable for temporal integration in sequence processing within the language domain. We believe that this work provides a step toward a computational neurobiology of language.

Here, we report the delivery of siRNA to plants with DNA nanostructures, which are able to deliver siRNA across the cell wall. We show that the size, shape, compactness, stiffness, and attachment location of the DNA nanostructure are important parameters for the delivery and gene silencing efficiency. We also show that the delivery of siRNA to plants is dependent on the endogenous gene silencing pathway. Our work establishes the feasibility of DNA nanostructures for the delivery of biomolecules to plants and also details the design parameters of importance for plant cell internalization and also assesses the impact of DNA nanostructure geometry for gene silencing mechanisms. This work is expected to be useful for the delivery of biomolecules to plants in the future."

However, the role of small tributaries in delivering nutrients to coastal areas is largely unknown. We show that the 6 largest of 235 tributaries to Lake Michigan account for ∼70% of the daily nutrient loads delivered to the lake. However, small tributaries exhibit nutrient loads that are high for their size and biased toward dissolved inorganic forms. This suggests that their plumes become trapped and then overlap in the nearshore zone, increasing the potential for coastal eutrophication. Our findings reveal an underappreciated role that small streams may play in driving coastal eutrophication in large water bodies."

We find that the long-time dynamics of such systems are biased toward states that exhibit a fine-tuned extremization of the environment. This behavior is reminiscent of the “fine-tuning problem” in cosmology, where the environment is the cosmic microwave background, and the rare combinations of chemical concentrations are the ones that extremize the environment."

Our results suggest that certification is not a silver bullet for reducing deforestation, but that it can be an important tool in the toolbox of policies to reduce deforestation."

However, the study of the dynamic regulation of the exocyst-related processes using mutants in genetically tractable organisms such as Arabidopsis thaliana is limited by the lethality or the severity of phenotypes. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 (exocyst component of 70 kDa) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Less)"

One of these factors is the accumulation of vitamin A aldehyde adducts (bisretinoids) that photogenerate reactive oxygen species and photodecompose into damaging aldehyde- and dicarbonyl-bearing species. We show that the Fe chelator deferiprone (DFP) reduces the oxidation and degradation of the bisretinoid A2E in the presence of light and reduces cell death in cell-based experiments. These findings suggest that Fe levels in the retina are important in the photooxidation and photodegradation of the bisretinoid A2E, which may contribute to the loss of photoreceptor cells in retinal diseases.

The use of farm machinery has been a key factor in the success of modern agriculture, but it has also contributed to the degradation of soil ecological functioning. We show that the use of farm machinery has led to the propagation of subsoil compaction into deeper soil layers, with potential loss of productivity. We also show that the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, suggesting that unconstrained roaming of these prehistoric giants would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles. This suggests that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This study highlights the need for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. (Abridged)"
