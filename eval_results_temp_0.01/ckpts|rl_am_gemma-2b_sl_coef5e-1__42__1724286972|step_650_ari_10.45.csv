Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. However, the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1.

We also suggest a hypothesis for the origin of the increased AD risk of the APOE4 allele. This hypothesis is based on the observation that APOE4 increases the accumulation of senescent synapses in the brain, which are more vulnerable to complement-mediated neurodegeneration.

Here we show that P. aeruginosa uses its surface-adhesion system to sense the mechanical activity of its pili. This sensing system is important for the regulation of the expression of virulence factors. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of how bacteria can sense their environment.

We present a detailed analysis of the faunal assemblage from the Hellenistic site of Maresha, Israel, and show that the exploitation of chickens was widespread and practiced on a large scale. This evidence is supported by a survey of the Southern Levant, which shows a sharp increase in the frequency of chicken during the Hellenistic period. We suggest that the gradual acclimatization of chickens in the Southern Levant and its gradual integration into the local economy, the latter fully accomplished in the Hellenistic period, was a crucial step in the adoption of this species in European husbandry some 100 y later. This process may have been facilitated by the availability of chickens in the region. (Read more)"

These results suggest that the xanthocillin BGC is involved in fungal copper homeostasis and the regulation of interactions with competing microbes. This is an important discovery for understanding the role of the xanthocillin BGC in fungal physiology and interactions with the environment. This article is protected by copyright.

These small RNAs are generally considered to be “noncoding,” but a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The RNA encodes a protein that interacts with a membrane protein and increases its activity. This protein is also translated by the ribosome, but the translation is inhibited by the RNA. This work demonstrates the importance of the translation and base-pairing functions of small RNAs. It also provides a mechanism for how the translation of small RNAs can be regulated. This work provides insight into the evolution of small RNAs and their regulation.

However, antibodies can mutate and lose their ability to neutralize viruses. This can lead to the emergence of new variants that are resistant to existing antibodies. Here, we introduce a deep learning algorithm that can be used to optimize the structure of antibodies to improve their ability to neutralize viruses. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by optimizing an antibody that is effective against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants but not the most recent variant, Delta. Our optimized antibody is ∼10- to 600-fold more potent against SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Delta. Our approach can potentially be used to optimize other proteins, such as vaccines, to improve their ability to protect against emerging variants. This could lead to the development of new vaccines and antibody drug candidates. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Our findings suggest that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxed functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner. During the functional reduction process, the elevation of evolutionary rates reaches several new rate equilibria, possibly relating to the modified protein turnover rates in heterotrophic plastids.

This detailed picture of the reaction pathway is key to understanding why one substrate is used in the reaction and not another. This work highlights the power of NMR-assisted crystallography for mechanistic enzymology. (Read more)"

However, the mechanisms underlying this process are not well understood. Here, we show that the squid Euprymna scolopes regulates the activities of its luminescent symbionts through the strategic provision of a single glycan. This glycan is released by the host only at night, when the organ colonized by the symbionts is mature. The catabolism of this glycan is specifically required for the acidification of the organ, which enhances the luminescence of the symbionts. Our results suggest that the timing of the provision of specific nutrients may be a general strategy used by animals to regulate the activities of their associated microbes.

These viruses were less infectious to human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into other cell types. These findings suggest that the first proteolytic events expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection. Therefore, the first proteolytic events may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence.

However, the impacts of climate change on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning have not been investigated together. We show that the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is sensitive to temperature. As temperatures change, the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning shifts, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This result is driven by two processes. First, more diverse communities are more likely to contain species with thermal traits that maintain productivity under thermal stress. Second, the contribution of complementarity to the net biodiversity effect increases at high and low temperatures, indicating that changes in species interactions play a critical role in mediating the impacts of temperature change on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

Certification is the most common tool used to meet corporate and government commitments to reduce this deforestation. However, the impact of certification on deforestation has not been well studied. We show that certification is associated with reduced deforestation in Indonesia. Nevertheless, most certified areas contained little residual forest when certification was granted. Certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Our results suggest that certification is not yet effective in reducing deforestation in oil palm plantations. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation.

Its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. The exocyst complex is evolutionarily conserved, and its regulation is essential to organisms across kingdoms. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 (exocyst component of 70 kDa) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and offers a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. This article is protected by copyright.

In many species, sex is determined by a single locus. In others, multiple loci interact to produce multiple genotypic sexes. Here we investigate the effects of multiple interacting sex determination alleles on the evolution of secondary sexual characteristics. We find that multiple alleles of a sex determination locus can produce modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics. This modularity provides context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of the maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations. Our results also highlight the importance of considering the genetic architecture of sex determination in the study of sex determination and evolution. This article is protected by copyright.

The retina is also a site where iron (Fe) plays a key role in redox active energy and electron transfer. We sought to understand how Fe levels impact the retina. We found that Fe levels in the retina are tightly regulated. We also found that Fe levels impact the retina in a manner that is important for the health of the retina. These findings have implications for the retina and for other tissues challenged by Fe.

However, the evolution of specialization is often considered a dead end. We show that siphonophores, a group of predators, can evolve specialization on different prey types. This evolutionary flexibility is associated with changes in the morphology of the tentacles, the structures used for prey capture. Our findings help understand the evolution of specialization in predators, and how it has shaped the present-day food web."

It is the only tool-using appendage and is the most complex of any mammal. The evolution of the human hand is a key area of research in human evolution. However, the fossil record is poor between 800,000 and 1.8 My old. This study provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key derived feature of the human hand. This suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo. This may have been in Homo erectus sensu lato. This is an important finding for understanding the evolution of the human hand and the emergence of modern human behavior. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Cancer cells have a high demand for one-carbon units, which are essential for cell growth. The enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) converts serine into glycine and a tetrahydrofolate-bound one-carbon unit. We have developed a small-molecule inhibitor of SHMT. We show that this inhibitor blocks colon cancer tumor growth in mice. We also show that this inhibitor is effective in B-cell cancers, but is ineffective in other types of cancer. This suggests that B-cell cancers have a unique metabolic profile. Thus, this inhibitor may be useful in the treatment of B-cell cancers. This article is protected by copyright.

The increase in farm machinery capacity has led to higher vehicle weights, which have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map of subsoil compaction susceptibility, which shows that 20% of arable land is at risk of chronic compaction. This alarming trend calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants.
