Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we compare the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Less)"

The disease is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is able to evade the host innate immune response by blocking nuclear import of transcription factors that are essential for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes. Our study shows that SARS-CoV-2 uses a viral protein, Orf6, to block nuclear import of transcription factors. Our results reveal a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the host innate immune response and may lead to the development of new antiviral strategies. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of proton channels, but the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

However, the extent to which species differ in their diets is largely unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level differences in diet. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven species of large herbivore in a semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species, even between pairs of species matched in body size and proportional grass consumption. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages, and that the diversity of large herbivores may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized."

This resistance requires sustained activation of mTORC1 and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)C1-dependent induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism.

LCCB-induced promotion of vascular remodeling requires STIM1, which is up-regulated in VSMCs from hypertensive rats. Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. Our study unravels a mechanism of LCCBs action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrates that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI.

To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. This study provides a proof of concept for the rational design of new antibiotics. The design strategy can be extended to other classes of antibiotics and to other targets of interest. This work is expected to contribute to the development of new antibiotics to combat the growing threat of antibiotic resistance. (Show more)"

We use a high-resolution large ensemble to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the probability of occurrence of multiyear rainfall deficits in the past and future decades. We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% by the year 2100 under an intermediate-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5) and to 80% under a high-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5-8.5). These results highlight the strong sensitivity of the drought risk in South Africa to future anthropogenic emissions. This work is important for understanding the impact of climate change on water resources and for informing water management strategies. (Less)

Neuroinflammation is associated with the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase, ASK1, which is known to be involved in the regulation of cell survival and death. In this study, we found that ASK1 is involved in the regulation of neuroinflammation in the central nervous system. We also found that ASK1 is involved in the generation of a proinflammatory environment in microglia/macrophages, which subsequently activates astrocytes to exacerbate neuroinflammation. Our findings suggest that ASK1 is a promising therapeutic target for reducing neuroinflammation.

We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a molecular mechanism for autism and may facilitate the development of new treatments. (Show more)"

This interaction is required for optimal viral replication and nonspecifically decreases the amount of viral RNA in the viral particles, resulting in an eightfold increase in empty viral particles. Our results indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions.

These results suggest the existence of a gut–brain axis in alcohol dependence, which implicates the gut microbiota as an actor in the gut barrier and in behavioral disorders. Thus, the gut microbiota seems to be a previously unidentified target in the management of alcohol dependence."

The biosynthesis of these compounds is not known, and the role of the genes involved in their production in the overall flavor of the fruit is unclear. Here we report the identification of a gene essential for the production of all the nitrogenous volatiles in tomato fruit. This gene encodes a flavin-dependent monooxygenase that catalyzes the production of a series of nitrogenous volatiles, and the loss of function of this gene results in the accumulation of a single compound. This work provides a major step forward in understanding the biosynthesis of tomato flavor. (Show more)"

We found that grid cells, which are thought to represent the internal representation of space, are organized separately from border, head-direction, and object-vector cells. These data suggest that grid cells may have a distinct organization from other cell types in the MEC. This study provides a detailed view of the organization of the MEC, which will be useful for understanding the function of this important brain area. (Show more)"
