We determined the ages of 40 large silicon carbide grains extracted from the Murchison CM2 meteorite. The grains have ages of 3.9 ± 1.6 Ma to ∼3 ± 2 Ga before the start of the Solar System ∼4.6 Ga ago. This is the oldest age of a presolar grain so far. The grains were part of aggregates in the interstellar medium. The grains acquired the bulk of their cosmogenic nuclides in the interstellar medium and not by exposure to an enhanced particle flux of the early active sun. This result has important implications for the origin of the solar system.

We show that the global fishing fleet has doubled in size since 1950, and the motorized fleet has expanded substantially. The effective CPUE of most countries has decreased since 1950, showing the increasing pressure of fisheries on ocean resources. We also show that the effective CPUE of most countries in 2015 was a fifth of its 1950s value, which was compared with a global decline in abundance. Based on historical patterns and allowing for the slowing rate of expansion, 1 million more motorized vessels could join the global fleet by midcentury as developing countries continue to transition away from subsistence fisheries. This will challenge sustainable use of fisheries' resources."

The data are available at a fine geographic resolution (mostly at the county level) and are updated daily. The data are available in a common format through the API and accompanying R and Python software packages. This paper provides examples demonstrating that the auxiliary signals in the COVIDcast API present information relevant to tracking COVID activity, augmenting traditional public health reporting and empowering research and decision-making.

However, the early-seral ecosystem is declining in two ecoregions, the Coast Range and Cascades, and bird populations are declining in these ecoregions. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure."

In this context, it is important to critically assess the scientific evidence that is used to support or refute the existence of a causal link between the pandemic and the failure of the public to comply with public health measures. This is particularly relevant in the context of the ongoing pandemic, where the failure of the public to comply with public health measures is often cited as a major reason for the continued spread of the virus. Here, we show that a classic experiment published 45 years ago, which is often cited as evidence for the existence of this causal link, is flawed in its methodology.

This allows us to derive a complete description of the entanglement dynamics in terms of a set of quasiparticle interactions.

However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, we found that a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations.

However, the impact of aerosols on clouds is still a controversial topic. This is mainly due to the lack of simultaneous observations of aerosols and clouds. Here, we introduce a new instrument, the dual-FOV high-spectral-resolution lidar, to observe aerosols and clouds simultaneously. This instrument is expected to be a significant contributor to the investigation of aerosol–cloud interaction. We demonstrate the capability of this instrument by observing aerosols and clouds over Beijing. The results show that the aerosol loading has no discernible effect on the liquid water path, but increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius. This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations obtained from the dual-FOV HSRL constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI."

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, HM predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. HM was associated with less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors. The findings highlight the importance of psychological examinations of masculinity as a cultural ideology to understand how men’s and women’s endorsement of HM legitimizes patriarchal dominance and reinforces gender, race, and class-based hierarchies via candidate support.

We connect changes in the physical appearance of five US cities with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, we found that a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations.

We show that the resulting model is robust across different crops, exhibits long-term stability, and has nation-wide validity.

The device configuration also enables application of optical tweezers for controlled placement of atoms. These 2D photonic crystal devices can be readily deployed to experiments for many-body physics with neutral atoms and engineering of exotic quantum matter. The device can be fabricated reliably from a 200-nm silicon nitride device layer using a lithography-based process, producing predicted optical properties in transmission and reflection measurements.

We show that humans have vastly expanded the spatial and seasonal “fire niche” in the coterminous United States, accounting for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. Human-started wildfires disproportionally occurred where fuel moisture was higher than lightning-started fires, thereby helping expand the geographic and seasonal niche of wildfire. Actions to raise awareness and increase management in regions prone to human-started wildfires should be a focus of United States policy to reduce fire risk and associated hazards."

We connect changes in the physical appearance of five US cities with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities. Our work is a step toward a more complete understanding of the physical dynamics of cities."

We provide a global map of riverine fisheries, which reveals that 90% of the world’s catch comes from river basins with above-average stress levels. Our data also show that freshwater fisheries provide the equivalent of all dietary animal protein for 158 million people, and that poor and undernourished populations are particularly reliant on inland fisheries. However, intensive fishing in regions where rivers are already degraded by other stressors may undermine efforts to conserve biodiversity. This syndrome of poverty, nutritional deficiency, fishery dependence, and extrinsic threats to biodiverse river ecosystems underscores the high stakes for improving fishery management. Our data can facilitate the inclusion of inland fisheries in environmental planning to protect both food security and species diversity."
