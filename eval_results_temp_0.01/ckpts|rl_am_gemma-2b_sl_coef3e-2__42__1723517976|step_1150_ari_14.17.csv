The structure of neon hydrate is found to be similar to that of ice II, which is the most stable phase of water at high pressure and low temperature. This work provides a new route to study the structure of ice II, which is of great importance to the understanding of the structure of ice in the universe.

However, it is not a theory in the ordinary sense of the word, in that it is not based on a set of axioms. This has led to a number of attempts to provide a set of axioms for quantum theory, with the goal of understanding it as a particular case of a more general theory. We provide a set of axioms that, in our view, guarantee that a category is equivalent to that of continuous linear functions between Hilbert spaces. This is a purely categorical approach to the foundations of quantum theory, and does not presuppose any analytical structure.

Here, we report the results of a genomic and transcriptomic analysis of two distantly related myxozoan species, Kudoa iwatai and Myxobolus cerebralis, and a less reduced cnidarian, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results show that myxozoans are cnidarians and are a sister taxon to the less reduced cnidarian parasite, P. hydriforme. We also show that myxozoans are among the most reduced animals in terms of genome size and gene content. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insight into the evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa and the extreme reduction in gene content and body plan that characterizes this group of parasites. (Show more)"

The virus responsible for this pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is able to evade the antiviral action of interferon (IFN) by blocking nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2. Here, we show that the viral accessory protein ORF6 is able to block nuclear import of the STAT1 and STAT2 heterodimer. We found that the protein localizes at the nuclear pore complex and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1, a protein complex involved in nuclear import. We also show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its ability to block nuclear import. Our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of interferon. This mechanism may be used by other viruses to evade IFN signaling. (Show more)"

We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

Here, we quantify the impact of temperature variability on maize yields in the major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. We find that the probability of simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year increases to 86% under 4 °C warming, which is a significant increase in instability in global grain trade and international grain prices.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant African LMH species. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers, and grass consumption was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of % grass consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption, but dietary composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. These findings have implications for understanding the role of LMH in ecosystem functioning and biodiversity."

However, the global load of plastic on the open ocean surface was estimated to be on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This is due to size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals.

The most widely used drugs for treating hypertension are the voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channel (Cav1.2) blockers (LCCBs). However, the long-term use of LCCBs is associated with the development of heart failure. Here, we show that LCCBs activate the STIM/ORAI pathway, which is a major pathway for store-operated Ca2+ entry. Our findings suggest that LCCBs may promote vascular remodeling and heart failure through activation of the STIM/ORAI pathway. Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. This study provides a mechanism of LCCB action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrates that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. (Show more)"

The NWFP’s success in halting the decline of early-seral–associated bird populations is encouraging, but the policy failed to halt the decline of these species on federal lands where clearcutting continued. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure."

The development of new antibiotics is a major challenge, since the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens to antibiotics is a major obstacle. Here, we present a rational design approach to identify new antibiotics. The approach is based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. We show that the best candidate designed by us is up to 56 times more active than telithromycin, a clinically used antibiotic, and that it is more accessible, exhibits higher solubility, and has higher binding affinity to the ribosome than the best candidate identified by screening. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. The approach presented here can be used to identify new antibiotics for a wide range of pathogens. This will help to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens to antibiotics.

We used a comprehensive dataset of 89 genes to estimate beetle diversification rates and traced the evolution of genes enabling symbiont-independent digestion of lignocellulose using 154 genomes or transcriptomes. Phylogenomic analyses of these uniquely comprehensive datasets resolved previously controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, plant cell wall-degrading enzymes obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, both major independent origins of specialized herbivory in beetles coincide with the first appearances of these genes. We propose that these genes enabled efficient digestion of plant tissues, including lignocellulose in cell walls, facilitating the evolution of uniquely specialized plant-feeding habits, such as leaf mining and stem and wood boring.

These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes.

It is broadly considered to be an anticancer target, but current inhibitors cannot distinguish between TRAP1 and HSP90, the other member of the HSP90 chaperone family. We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1 may act as a tumor suppressor in some settings. These data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This may be particularly true in the context of cancers that express less TRAP1 than do their normal tissue counterparts. This may be a significant finding in the context of the current debate over the role of HSP90 inhibitors in cancer therapy. (PsycINFO Database Record"

These proteins are important regulators of cell shape and motility, and they are also involved in diseases such as cancer metastasis. The proteins of this family are small, and they are thought to bind to actin filaments and to dissociate them from each other. However, how they do so in a physiological context, where filaments are interconnected and under mechanical stress, remains unclear. Here, we show that the proteins of this family can induce a mechanical torque on filaments, which enhances severing. This mechanism is critical to boost ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. We propose that this mechanochemical mechanism is a general feature of actin filament disassembly. It is likely to be important in many biological processes, including cell motility and cancer metastasis. (Show more)"

The findings also suggest that fructose may activate brain regions involved in attention and reward processing, which may contribute to the development of obesity. These results are consistent with the notion that the metabolic effects of fructose may be mediated by its effects on insulin signaling.

We find that Madagascar was settled by a population that was already admixed with a few Asian and European contributions. The settlement history of Madagascar is also shown to be sex biased, with a higher contribution of Asian ancestry to males. This study shows that Madagascar was settled by multiple independent waves of migration, which is in contrast to the single-wave hypothesis.

To understand the mechanism of temperature-dependent growth, we compared the transcriptional response of primary mouse airway epithelial cells infected with rhinovirus at 33 °C vs. 37 °C. We found that rhinovirus replicates more efficiently at 37 °C, and this temperature-dependent growth is dependent on the MAVS protein, a key signaling adaptor of the RIG-I–like receptors (RLRs). Stimulation of primary airway cells with the synthetic RLR ligand poly I:C led to higher levels of type I IFN induction at 37 °C than at 33 °C, and this temperature-dependent IFN induction correlated with higher levels of ISG induction at 37 °C. These findings demonstrate that in mouse airway cells, rhinovirus replicates preferentially at nasal cavity temperature due, in part, to a less efficient antiviral defense response of infected cells at cool temperature. This study provides insight into the mechanism of temperature-dependent rhinovirus replication and may have implications for the development of rhinovirus vaccines and therapeutics. ("

In bacteria, they function as precursors to nucleoside tetraphosphate (Np4) RNA caps, which are required for rapid degradation of the capsulated RNA. In Escherichia coli, the predominant decapping enzyme, ApaH, is inactivated by the very conditions of disulfide stress that enable Np4-capped RNAs to accumulate to high levels. Here, we show that, in such conditions, the RNA pyrophosphohydrolase RppH assumes a leading role in decapping those transcripts, preferring them as substrates over their triphosphorylated and diphosphorylated counterparts. The unique manner in which capped substrates of this kind bind to the active site of RppH positions the δ-phosphate, rather than the β-phosphate, for hydrolytic attack, generating triphosphorylated RNA as the primary product of decapping. This study reveals a mechanism for the differential impact of stress on the rates at which capped and uncapped 5′ termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation.

The HSRL is capable of simultaneously profiling aerosol and water cloud properties, especially water cloud microphysical properties. Continuous observations of aerosols and clouds using this instrument, verified by the Monte Carlo simulation and coincident observations of other techniques, were conducted to investigate the interactions between aerosol loading and water cloud microphysical properties.

They open and close their pore gates to allow or block ion flow. K+ channels commonly possess two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that BK channels can exhibit slow C-type inactivation/recovery, which is state-dependent and can be prevented by an open-state mutation. We propose that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. This study provides a new perspective on the relationship between activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery in K+ channels. It also provides a new mechanism for the BK channel’s slow C-type inactivation/recovery and its role in the control of cardiac excitability. (Show more)"

Nesocodon mauritianus (Campanulaceae) produces a blood-red nectar that has been proposed to serve as a visual attractant for pollinator visitation. Here, we show that the nectar’s red color is derived from a previously undescribed alkaloid termed nesocodin. We identify a convergently evolved trait in two vertebrate-pollinated species, suggesting that the red pigment is selectively favored and that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation.

In addition, we find that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago. These results indicate that complex demographic processes during the Early Medieval period may have contributed in an unexpected way to shape the modern European genetic landscape."

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how HKU4 and HKU5 transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results suggest that MERS-CoV, but not HKU4, has adapted to use human cells for cross-species transmission. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmission. These findings are important for understanding the origin and evolution of MERS-CoV and for preventing future zoonotic outbreaks. (Show more)"

However, the molecular mechanisms that govern the replication of the lagging strand are different in humans and yeast. In humans, the lagging strand is replicated by a single DNA polymerase δ (pol δ) that is anchored to the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) sliding clamp. We have developed unique kinetic assays to measure the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. Our results indicate that the pol δ holoenzyme is not very processive and dissociates from PCNA very quickly. Such behavior is important for the synthesis of Okazaki fragments in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. These results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of lagging strand DNA synthesis in humans. They also suggest that the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is not as high as previously thought."

Here, we show that an RNA polymerase ribozyme can replicate RNA with high efficiency, and we demonstrate that the polymerase can also synthesize a variety of functional RNA molecules, including aptamers and ribozymes. Thus, the polymerase can replicate genetic information and convert it into functional molecules, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life.

Here, we show that the squid Euprymna scolopes regulates the activities of its luminescent symbiont, Vibrio fischeri, through the strategic provision of a single glycan, chitin. We show that chitin is provided to the squid only at dusk, when the symbiotic organ is at its most mature. This glycan is catabolized by the symbiont, which is thereby able to maintain a high population level in the organ. Finally, catabolism of chitin by the symbiont is also required for a periodic acidification of the organ, which enhances the level of oxygen available to the symbionts. We propose that this strategy is used by other animal hosts to regulate the activities of their associated microbes. (Show more)"

Therefore, it is difficult to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting.

Here, we identified and characterized a protein (MTX) that is highly concentrated in the submandibular salivary gland of the bat, Myotis pilosus. MTX inhibits the antiviral immune response of the host and facilitates viral infection by selectively inhibiting the epoxide hydrolase function of leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) to inhibit LTA4 hydrolysis and the generation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a potent lipid chemoattractant for host defense against infection. This study provides deeper insight into immunologically privileged sites for microbial community residence in bats and supports the therapeutic potential of targeting MTX-LTA4H.

We show that formate, a one-carbon donor, rescues cells from SHMT inhibition, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions of mutant SOD1, TDP-43, and FUS are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. To explain the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in the brain and spinal cord, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

This process is blocked by an antagonist of CRFR1. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the development of cerebral edema in hypoxia and suggest that CRFR1 may be a potential target for the treatment of this condition.

It arises in the context of big data and complex statistical models. The challenge is to assess the strength of associations that we find in a data set, given that we have chosen which associations to look for. The problem is important because it is becoming increasingly common to use data mining to find associations in large data sets. We describe some recent new developments in selective inference and illustrate their use in forward stepwise regression, the lasso, and principal components analysis. The new methods are more powerful and more efficient than previous methods. They are also more transparent, in that they make explicit the assumptions that are being made about the data. This makes it easier to assess the validity of the inferences that are made from the data."

However, the minimum number of transcription factors that directly induce EC development remains undefined. Here, we demonstrate that ets variant 2 (ETV2) alone induces EC development from human adult skin fibroblasts. In coordination with endogenous FOXC2 in fibroblasts, ETV2 induces expression of multiple key endothelial development factors, including FLI1, ERG, and TAL1, and induces expression of endothelial functional molecules, including EGFL7 and von Willebrand factor. Consequently, ETVECs exhibits EC characteristics in vitro and forms mature functional vasculature in Matrigel plugs transplanted in NOD SCID mice. Our study indicates that the creation of ETVECs provides further understanding of human EC development induced by ETV2. This approach may be useful for the treatment of vascular disorders.

Specifically, STING deficiency in β-cells caused a decrease in β-cell function–related genes, including Glut2, Kcnj11, and Abcc8, leading to impaired GSIS. Moreover, STING deficiency decreased Pax6 nuclear localization and expression in β-cells, which might be responsible for defective GSIS.

Their genome is segmented into eight fragments, which offers evolutionary advantages but complicates genomic packaging. The existence of a selective packaging mechanism, in which one copy of each viral RNA is specifically packaged into each virion, is suspected, but its molecular details remain unknown. Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus using in vitro experiments. Using silent trans-complementary mutants, we then demonstrated that this interaction takes place in infected cells and is required for optimal viral replication. Disruption of this interaction did not affect the HA titer of the mutant viruses, suggesting that the same amount of viral particles was produced. However, it nonspecifically decreased the amount of viral RNA in the viral particles, resulting in an eightfold increase in empty viral particles. Our experiments indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions. The lack of conservation of these interactions might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses. (Show more)"

Neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology.

We demonstrate that the catabolism of amino acids during heat stress promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates, which in turn increases the metabolic energy demand of the coral host. This energy limitation, in turn, promotes the degradation of amino acids, thus forming a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host. Our findings provide a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

These results provide a mechanistic explanation for the metabolic memory of intensive glucose control and may explain why the risk of macrovascular complications is reduced for many years after the end of intensive glucose control.

Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. (Show more)"

Here, we used portable two-photon microscopes to record from a large number of neurons in MEC and parasubiculum during free-running behavior. We found that grid cells are anatomically segregated from border, head-direction, and object-vector cells, and that grid cells are strongly coupled among themselves.

This system, which we term “striosome–dendron bouquets,” is formed by striosomal neurons that project to striosomes, which in turn project to dopamine-containing nigral cell bodies.

We asked pairs of friends and strangers to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Finally, we demonstrate that this signal is used by third-party listeners as a heuristic of how well people are connected: Conversations with faster response times were perceived as more connected than the same conversations with slower response times. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

The fossil record for the evolution of the hand is fragmentary, however, and the earliest hominin fossils are more than 1.8 My old. Here we report the discovery of a hominin hand fossil from East Africa that preserves the third metacarpal styloid process, a key derived feature of the human hand that is absent in early hominins. This fossil provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of this key derived feature of the human hand and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo. This finding has implications for the evolution of the human hand and the emergence of modern human behavior. (Show more)"

In mammals, SHMT1 is cytosolic, and SHMT2 is mitochondrial. Here we show that dual knockout of SHMT1/2 blocks colon cancer tumor growth in mice. We also identify a series of small-molecule dual SHMT inhibitors, which are effective in vitro and in vivo. A cancer cell-line screen reveals that B-cell lines are particularly sensitive to SHMT inhibition. We show that formate, the one-carbon donor, rescues cells from SHMT inhibition, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of DLBCL. These findings provide a rationale for the development of SHMT inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment.

In this study, we show that deforestation over a 5-y period (2008–2013) led to a reduction in household fruit and vegetable consumption and thus vitamin A adequacy of diets. Conversely, we found that forest fragmentation over the survey period led to an increase in consumption of these foods and dietary vitamin A adequacy. This study finds a causal link between deforestation and people’s dietary quality, and the results have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals."

In particular, the use of farm machinery has led to the compaction of soil, which is a major threat to soil productivity. We show that the use of farm machinery has led to the compaction of soil to the point where it is now a threat to soil ecological functioning. We also show that the use of farm machinery has led to the compaction of soil to the point where it is now a threat to soil ecological functioning.
