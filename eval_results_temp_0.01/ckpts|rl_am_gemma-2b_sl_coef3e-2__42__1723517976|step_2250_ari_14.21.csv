Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we present the first comparative analysis of the genomes of two myxozoans and a cnidarian parasite, and show that myxozoans are a sister group to the less reduced cnidarian parasite, P. hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. These results have implications for understanding the evolution of parasitism and the origin of the parasitic lifestyle. (Read more)"

This distribution is mostly the result of a size-selective sink, which involves the fragmentation of plastic debris into smaller particles, their transfer to the ocean interior, and the accumulation of these particles in the deep sea. This study provides a better understanding of the fate of the missing plastic debris, and of the importance of this pollution in the ocean.

The strongest genetic risk factor for AD is the apoE allele, APOE4. APOE is a major component of the classical complement cascade and is highly expressed in the brain. Here, we report a novel role for APOE in controlling the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes, which is highly dependent on APOE isoform. We also found that APOE alleles affect the accumulation of a complement component, C1q, in the brain, which may contribute to the increased vulnerability of senescent synapses to complement-mediated neurodegeneration in APOE4. These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes. They also suggest the hypothesis that AD susceptibility of APOE4 may originate in part from defective phagocytic capacity of astrocytes which accelerates the rate of accumulation of C1q-coated senescent synapses, enhancing synaptic vulnerability to classical-complement-cascade mediated neurodegeneration. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that APOE4 is associated with increased risk of stroke."

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal and transformed cells is more complex than previously appreciated. We have shown that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor.

These changes are critical for the invasion process and suggest that the parasite primes the red blood cell surface, reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion.

Here, we present 17 genomes from 5,000 to 2,500 y BP, which allowed us to explore correlations between temporal, geographical, and genetic distance.

Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4.

However, the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the drought risk in this region is difficult to quantify, given the small regional scale. Here, we use a high-resolution large ensemble to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the probability of occurrence of multiyear rainfall deficits in the region. We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% by the year 2100 under an intermediate-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5) and to 80% under a high-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5-8.5). These results highlight the strong sensitivity of the drought risk in SSA to future anthropogenic emissions. This work is important for the development of adaptation strategies in the region.

Here, we report the discovery of a hitherto unknown composition of icosahedral quasicrystal in a sample of red trinitite, the first test explosion of a nuclear bomb. The discovery of this material, which was formed at a time of great historical significance, provides a unique opportunity to study the conditions under which quasicrystals are formed and to explore the potential for the discovery of new quasicrystal-forming systems. This work contributes to our understanding of the origin of quasicrystals and their potential applications in a wide range of fields. (Show more)"

The etiology of autism is so complicated because it involves the effects of variants of several hundred risk genes along with the contribution of environmental factors. Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies.

Neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

These chemicals are produced by a variety of metabolic pathways, and the biosynthetic pathways of many of these pathways are not known. Here, we report the identification of a gene essential for the production of all the nitrogenous volatiles in tomato fruit. This gene encodes a flavin-dependent monooxygenase that catalyzes sequential hydroxylation reactions to produce the nitrogenous volatiles. This work provides a major step forward in understanding the chemistry of tomato fruit flavor and will be a valuable resource for the tomato breeding and flavor improvement community. (Read more)"

This result is driven by two processes. First, more diverse communities have a greater chance of including species with thermal traits that enable them to maintain productivity as temperatures shift from ambient conditions. Second, we found a pronounced increase in the contribution of complementarity to the net biodiversity effect at high and low temperatures, indicating that changes in species interactions played a critical role in mediating the impacts of temperature change on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. This finding has implications for the conservation of ecosystem functioning in a warming world."

This alarming trend calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the largest sauropods had the longest legs, which are likely to have been used for locomotion in the forest environment."
