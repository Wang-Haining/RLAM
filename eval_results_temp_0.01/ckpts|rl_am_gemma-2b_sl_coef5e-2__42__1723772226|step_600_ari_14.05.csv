However, the structure of the hydrate formed by the enclathration of neon in ice II is still unknown. In this study, we synthesized the neon hydrate and studied its structure by neutron diffraction. The structure of the neon hydrate is ice II-like, which is the first example of enclathration of a guest in ice II. The guest atoms are enclathrated in the centers of channels, and their freedom of movement is restricted by the structure of the host ice II.

Although the evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we present the first comparative genomic analysis of two distantly related myxozoan species and a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results show that the myxozoan body plan was reduced to a minimal structure, with a genome that is one of the smallest reported in animals. This study provides insight into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are critical for induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We found that SARS-CoV-2 uses a viral accessory protein, Orf6, to block nuclear import of the cargo-receptor complex. We show that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain. We also show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its ability to antagonize the antiviral action of IFN. Our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the host immune response and may lead to the development of new antiviral strategies."

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1.

However, the extent to which species differ in their diets is largely unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa in herbivore feces. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species of wild and domestic LMH in semiarid African savanna. We found that LMH consumed a wide range of plant species, and that species differed in their diets. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption, but dietary composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This study highlights the need for more comprehensive and taxonomically fine-grained studies of diet partitioning in LMH. (Show more)"

We show that the plastic debris load on the open ocean surface is far less than expected, mostly due to the size-selective sinks of plastic debris in the ocean interior. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

The most common treatment for hypertension is the use of drugs that block the voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channel (Cav1.2). However, these drugs are associated with a high risk of developing heart failure. Here, we show that the three major classes of LCCBs activate the store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which is mediated by the STIM/ORAI pathway. Our data indicate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. Our findings unravel a mechanism of LCCBs action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. This study provides a rationale for the use of LCCBs in hypertension. (Show more)"

The development of new antibacterial agents is therefore essential to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. In this study, we present a rational design approach to identify new acylide antibiotics. The design strategy is based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess the performance of our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. Our study provides a proof of concept for the rational design of new antibiotics. This approach can be extended to other classes of antibiotics and to other targets. It can also be used to design new molecules for other diseases."

We show that the evolution of brain size is characterized by four major shifts in neuron–brain scaling. The most dramatic increases in brain neurons occurred independently with the appearance of birds and mammals, resulting in convergent neuron scaling in the two endothermic lineages. This has important implications for studies using relative brain size as a proxy when looking for evolutionary drivers of animal cognition."

We have shown that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 may act as a tumor suppressor in some settings. This study provides a mechanistic basis for the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers. These data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. (Read more)"

It is involved in many cellular processes, including cell motility, cell division, and cell morphogenesis. ADF is known to bind to actin filaments and to depolymerize them, but the mechanism by which it does so is not well understood. Here, we show that ADF binds to actin filaments and depolymerizes them in a mechanical context that is relevant to cells. We find that ADF enhances the depolymerization rate of filaments that are held in a twisted configuration, which we propose is due to a mechanical torque exerted by ADF on the filaments. This torque is enhanced by the mechanical stress of a microfluidic flow, and we propose that this mechanism is critical for ADF to depolymerize actin filaments in cells. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of ADF’s action in cells. They also suggest that mechanical stress can be harnessed to control the dynamics of actin filaments in vitro and in vivo. This is important for understanding actin dynamics in cells and for developing new therapies for diseases caused by actin filament dysregulation."

We find a common Bantu and Austronesian descent for all Malagasy individuals with a limited paternal contribution from Europe and the Middle East. Admixture and demographic growth happened recently, suggesting a rapid settlement of Madagascar during the last millennium. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population.

We induced C-type inactivation in BK channels and studied the relationship between activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery. We observed prominent slow C-type inactivation/recovery in BK channels by an extreme low concentration of extracellular K+ together with a Y294E/K/Q/S or Y279F mutation whose equivalent in Shaker channels (T449E/K/D/Q/S or W434F) caused a greatly accelerated rate of C-inactivation or constitutive C-inactivation.

We find that low humidity impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in mice deficient in caspase-1/11, an enzyme involved in tissue repair. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

We identify a convergently evolved trait in two vertebrate-pollinated species, suggesting that the red pigment is selectively favored and that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation. This work cumulatively identifies a convergently evolved trait in two vertebrate-pollinated species, suggesting that the red pigment is selectively favored and that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation."

Here we present a case study of a group of women from Bavaria, Germany, who exhibit a very high genetic heterogeneity, including signals of ancestry from western Europe to East Asia. We show that this heterogeneity is not due to admixture with non-European populations, but rather to a high degree of within-group diversity. This example of female-biased migration indicates that complex demographic processes during the Early Medieval period may have contributed in an unexpected way to shape the modern European genetic landscape."

The polymerase responsible for this process, DNA polymerase δ (pol δ), is a large enzyme that requires a sliding clamp to facilitate strand displacement. The pol δ holoenzyme is extremely stable, but the mechanism of this stability is unknown. We developed unique kinetic assays to measure the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. Our results indicate that the pol δ holoenzyme dissociates from the PCNA sliding clamp during replication. This behavior has profound implications for the synthesis of Okazaki fragments as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. These results provide a mechanistic explanation for the unique properties of pol δ and the role it plays in eukaryotic DNA replication. They also provide a framework for understanding the role of pol δ in human disease."

In the hypothesized RNA world, before the evolution of proteins, genetic information was stored in RNA molecules and replicated by RNA polymerases. In the laboratory, the evolution of RNA polymerases has been studied, but the evolution of the RNA polymerase activity itself has not. Here, we report the in vitro evolution of a polymerase ribozyme that can synthesize a variety of functional RNA molecules, including aptamers, ribozymes, and even tRNA. This polymerase activity can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins.

First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology.

The Black and Latino populations are estimated to experience declines in life expectancy at birth of 2.10 and 3.05 y, respectively, both of which are several times the 0.68-y reduction for Whites. Latinos, who have consistently experienced lower mortality than Whites, would see their more than 3-y survival advantage reduced to less than 1 y.

We calculate, as a function of pressure, two central chemical properties of atoms, electronegativity and chemical hardness, which can be seen as the first- and second-order chemical potentials. We find that for most elements, chemical hardness and electronegativity decrease with pressure, consistent with pressure-induced metallization. Furthermore, we discover that pressure-induced s-d orbital transfer makes Ni, Pd, and Pt “pseudo–noble-gas” atoms with a closed d-shell configuration, and the elements preceding them (Fe and, especially, Co, Rh, and Ir) electron acceptors, while the elements right after them (Cu, Ag, Zn, and Cd) become highly electropositive.

We demonstrate that monoclonal antibodies targeting IL1RAP have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We further show that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects. These results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. The results also provide evidence that antibody-mediated killing of AML cells is possible in the absence of complement and natural killer cells. This is important because these cells are often absent or dysfunctional in AML patients. Thus, the results provide a basis for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for AML. (Read more)"

Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete."

Therefore, it is challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting.

Rather, the coaggregating proteins have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

To better understand how sequential proteolysis contributes to MERS-CoV infection, we engineered viruses with mutations that blocked the first cleavages. These mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses trafficked past cell-surface proteases and into endosomes, whereas precleaved viruses used endosomal proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry. Uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence"

ETV2 induces expression of multiple key endothelial development factors, including FLI1, ERG, and TAL1, and induces expression of endothelial functional molecules, including EGFL7 and von Willebrand factor. Consequently, ETVECs exhibits EC characteristics in vitro and forms mature functional vasculature in Matrigel plugs transplanted in NOD SCID mice.

Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning becomes steeper, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This result is driven by two processes linked to the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. First, more diverse communities have a greater chance of including species with thermal traits that enable them to maintain productivity as temperatures shift from ambient conditions. Second, we find a pronounced increase in the contribution of complementarity to the net biodiversity effect at high and low temperatures, indicating that changes in species interactions play a critical role in mediating the impacts of temperature change on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function."

We asked pairs of friends and strangers to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Finally, we demonstrate that this signal is used by third-party listeners as a heuristic of how well people are connected: Conversations with faster response times were perceived as more connected than the same conversations with slower response times. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

We also show that Fe can influence the fate of the bisretinoid A2E, which is a model for the lipofuscin-derived species that can photodegrade photoreceptors. These findings have implications for the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in the elderly. (Read more)"

However, the evolution of predator specialization is often considered a dead end, as it is difficult to evolve morphological and functional optimizations in separate structures. Here we show that siphonophores, a group of pelagic cnidarians, have evolved modular prey-capture systems that allow for the evolution of specialization on different prey types. Our results suggest that shifts between prey types are linked to shifts in the morphology, mode of evolution, and evolutionary correlations of tentilla and their nematocysts. Our findings contribute to understanding how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs. They also help build a broader perspective on predatory niche diversification via morphological innovation and evolution."

This study provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key shared derived characteristic of modern human and Neandertal hand morphology, the third metacarpal styloid process. The fossil provides the earliest evidence for the evolution of Homo-like hand morphology and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato. This study also provides a rare example of the application of a new analytical approach to the study of fossil hand anatomy. (Show more)"

The enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) provides these units, but cancer cells have a defective glycine import system, which makes them highly sensitive to inhibition of SHMT. We have developed a series of small-molecule dual inhibitors of SHMT1 and SHMT2, which are highly effective in cancer cells, but not in normal cells. We have also identified a deficiency in glycine import as a targetable metabolic defect of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. These findings provide a rationale for the development of SHMT inhibitors as a cancer therapy. They also suggest that targeting the one-carbon unit supply system may be a promising strategy for the treatment of other diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders."

This study shows that deforestation can reduce people’s consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are important sources of micronutrients. Conversely, forest fragmentation can increase consumption of fruits and vegetables, which is important for meeting micronutrient needs. These findings have important implications for policy makers, who should consider the role of natural landscapes in improving people’s diets and, in particular, the role of forests."

This increase in weight has led to compaction of the soil, which is detrimental to the soil’s ability to support plant growth. We show that the weight of farm machinery has increased so much that the weight of modern harvesters is now comparable to the weight of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods. This weight has led to compaction of the subsoil, which is now at risk of being permanently damaged. We hypothesize that the roaming of sauropods on land may have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm machinery."
