However, the structure of the hydrate, which is a kind of ice-like crystalline solid, has not been determined. In this work, we report the structure of neon hydrate, which is the first example of a hydrate with a crystalline structure. The structure of the hydrate is determined by in situ neutron diffraction at high pressure and low temperature. The structure of the hydrate is similar to that of ice II, which is the most stable phase of water at high pressure and low temperature. This work provides a new perspective for the study of the structure of ice II and the hydrate. It also provides a new route for the study of the structure of ice Ih, which is the most stable phase of water at ambient conditions. (Show more)"

In this paper, we provide a purely categorical approach to the foundations of quantum theory. The approach is based on a set of axioms that are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. The axioms are shown to be sufficient to characterize the category of continuous linear operators between Hilbert spaces. This provides a mathematical foundation for the theory of quantum states and the theory of quantum operations. The approach is also shown to be consistent with the principles of mathematical realism and locality."

Here, we report the results of a comparative analysis of the genomes of two myxozoans and a cnidarian parasite. Our results show that myxozoans are a sister group to the rest of the Myxozoa, and that they are one of the most reduced animal genomes known. This reduction is accompanied by a reduction in gene content and expression, suggesting that the myxozoan body plan was lost through a process of extreme degeneration. Our results provide insights into the molecular basis of the transition from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic myxozoan. (Less)"

The virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, is able to evade the antiviral action of the immune system by blocking the nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are essential for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 uses a viral accessory protein, Orf6, to block nuclear import of the STAT1 and STAT2 proteins. We found that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and directly interacts with the Nup98-Rae1 complex to impair docking of the cargo-receptor complex and disrupt nuclear import. Our results unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the antiviral action of the immune system and may lead to the development of new antiviral strategies.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of the proton channel. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits the proton channel will further our understanding of the proton channel and might provide valuable information for future drug development for the proton channel.

Meeting the food demand of this population will become increasingly challenging as the Earth’s climate continues to warm. Earlier studies suggest that once the optimum growing temperature is exceeded, mean crop yields decline and the variability of yield increases even if interannual climate variability remains unchanged. Here, we use global datasets of maize production and climate variability combined with future temperature projections to quantify how yield variability will change in the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. We find that as the global mean temperature increases, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation (CV) of maize yields increases almost everywhere to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation (SD) of yields and a decrease in mean yields. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large herbivores in semiarid African savanna. We found that the extent of dietary overlap between species was greater than expected by chance, and that species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption had the greatest overlap. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results highlight the need for more comprehensive and species-level identification of food plants in future studies of large herbivore diets. (Abridged)"

This problem can be addressed by the development of new antibacterial agents to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. Here, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. This work provides a proof of concept for the use of computational predictions in the design of new antibiotics. (Show more)"

However, the number of trainable parameters in these networks is often large, which makes them difficult to train and apply in practice. Here, we introduce a network architecture that is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data. The proposed architecture is also easier to implement and train, and is more robust to changes in the training data. We believe that the proposed architecture will be useful for many image-processing problems in the future."

Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

However, whether and how the brain builds such structures is largely unknown. Here, we show that the brain’s activity increases with each successive word in a sentence but decreases suddenly whenever words can be merged into a phrase. This merge operation is consistent with a neural implementation of a bottom-up or left-corner parser of the incoming language stream. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases. This may be a fundamental property of the language system."

Vaccines are the most effective way to control the pandemic. However, the high cost of the currently available vaccines may limit their global access. This study reports a recombinant protein vaccine candidate that can be manufactured at a low cost and can be used to produce billions of doses annually. The vaccine candidate is based on a variant of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, which mediates viral entry to cells. The variant exhibits high-affinity binding to the receptor, high-yield manufacturability, and enhanced immunogenicity compared to the currently used variant. The vaccine candidate can be used to produce virus-like particles (VLPs) that can be used to treat COVID-19 in hamsters. These results provide a promising approach for the development of a low-cost, high-yield, and effective vaccine for COVID-19. This approach can be extended to other infectious diseases.

We found that women’s and men’s endorsement of HM predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. HM was associated with less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia, but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors. The findings highlight the importance of psychological examinations of masculinity as a cultural ideology to understand how men’s and women’s endorsement of HM legitimizes patriarchal dominance and reinforces gender, race, and class-based hierarchies via candidate support.

To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4.

However, their assessments are subjective and categorical, and are not easily amenable to quantitative analysis. We show that the USDA Crop Progress and Condition survey, which is conducted by a large number of crop experts across the country, can be transformed into a continuous, probabilistic variable that can be used to monitor crop status and predict crop yields. We demonstrate that this index outperforms official forecasts released midseason by several weeks and provides earlier and more precise predictions of crop yields. This work provides a framework for the use of crop expert assessments in agricultural monitoring and forecasting. It also provides a new source of information for the agricultural community. Finally, it provides a valuable resource for the development of new applications in agriculture, such as the monitoring of crop health and the development of precision agriculture systems."

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis remain unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated the impact of O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (EtdT) lesions on the transcription of a lacZ reporter gene. We found that the three regioisomeric EtdT lesions can all induce transcriptional stalling, and the stalling profiles are dependent on the position of the lesion in the DNA template. In addition, we found that the stalling profiles are controlled by the pol II fidelity checkpoints. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop) that is involved in modulating the translocation of minor-groove alkylated DNA template after nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion. Taken together, this work provides important mechanistic insights into transcriptional stalling, lesion bypass, and mutagenesis of alkylated DNA lesions. This work will help us to understand the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced mutagenesis and the development of therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment."

We find that universal vote-by-mail does not appear to affect either party’s share of turnout, does not appear to increase either party’s vote share, and modestly increases overall average turnout rates, in line with previous estimates.

In the mammalian CNS, however, the regenerative capacity of neurons is severely compromised, and regeneration is not possible in the peripheral nervous system. Here, we identify a form of regeneration that is remarkably independent of the canonical MAPK signaling pathway, which is known to mediate regeneration in the adult mammalian CNS. This discovery provides a platform for the discovery of novel factors and signaling pathways that regulate the regenerative capacity of the adult CNS. Moreover, our study suggests that the mammalian CNS may be more regenerative than previously thought."

Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. This article is protected by copyright.

Thus, these striosome–dendron formations, here termed “striosome–dendron bouquets,” likely represent subsystems with the nigro–striato–nigral loop that are affected in human disorders including Parkinson’s disease. Given evidence that striosomes receive input from cortical regions related to the control of mood and motivation and that they link functionally to reinforcement and decision-making, the striosome–dendron bouquets could be critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease.

The retina is also challenged by the accumulation of lipid-derived reactive intermediates, which are generated by the photooxidation of lipofuscin, a pigment that accumulates in the retinal pigment epithelium. We show that the levels of iron in the retina, which is a key player in the generation of reactive intermediates, can influence the levels of these reactive intermediates. These findings have implications for the understanding of the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration and other retinal diseases. (Read more)"

However, the evolution of predator specialization has been considered an evolutionary dead end. Here we show that siphonophores, a group of pelagic cnidarians, have evolved to capture different prey types using the same structure, and that these changes are linked to the evolution of the structure and function of the prey-capturing system. Our findings help to understand the evolution of specialization and morphological innovation in predators, and contribute to the study of the evolution of food webs."

We have developed a small-molecule inhibitor of the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), which is critical for the generation of the one-carbon unit. We have also identified a metabolic vulnerability of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which is a particularly aggressive form of cancer. This work provides a foundation for the development of a class of drugs that target the one-carbon unit, and may be useful in the treatment of cancer."

However, it is also a major driver of food and nutrition security, particularly in rural areas of low- and middle-income countries. This study shows that deforestation can have a negative impact on people’s diets, and that this impact is exacerbated by fragmentation of forests. This study has important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. This study also highlights the need for more research on the role of natural landscapes in improving people’s diets."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We hypothesize that the paradox of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction, including the roaming of sauropods, may have guided the development of ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, that guided these prehistoric giants. This study highlights the need for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. (Less)"
