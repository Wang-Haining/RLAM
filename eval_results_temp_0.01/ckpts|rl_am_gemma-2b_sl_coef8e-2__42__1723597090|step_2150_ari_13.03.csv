In this paper, we provide a purely categorical approach to the foundations of quantum theory. The approach is based on a set of axioms that guarantee that a category is equivalent to that of continuous linear operators between Hilbert spaces. The axioms are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. The approach is illustrated with a number of examples. The approach is not intended to be a complete solution to the problem of the foundations of quantum theory, but we believe it to be a significant step in that direction."

We have generated the first genomic and transcriptomic assemblies for two species of myxozoans, and compared them to the genome of a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results show that myxozoans are cnidarians and are a sister group to the group that includes the corals. We also find that myxozoans are one of the most reduced animal groups, with a small genome and a reduced gene content. This suggests that the transition from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic one was accompanied by a reduction in genome size and gene content. This may be a common theme in the evolution of parasites. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We found that SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This mechanism may be used by other viruses as well. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammal species in semiarid African savanna. We found that, despite being similar in body size, digestive physiology, and location, the diets of these species differed substantially. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption, but dietary composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammal assemblages, and that large mammal diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This may have important implications for the management of large mammal populations and the conservation of biodiversity. (Abridged)"

We show that the plastic debris is mostly concentrated in the convergence zones of the five subtropical gyres, but the global load of plastic on the open ocean surface is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This discrepancy is explained by the selective removal of plastic debris in the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

The selectivity filter is the narrowest part of the channel and is responsible for the selective permeation of K+ ions. The activation gate is the part of the channel that opens and closes the channel. We have identified a key residue in the activation gate that is functionally and structurally coupled to the selectivity filter. We have also demonstrated that the collapse of the selectivity filter can lead to the structural transition of the channel from the closed to the open state.

We found that the activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis, which is highly frequent in cancer, confers ferroptosis resistance. This resistance is mediated, at least in part, by the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and the fatty acid desaturase stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), which are downstream targets of SREBP1. We also found that inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis induction, and that this sensitivity can be restored by ectopic expression of SREBP1 or SCD1.

The development of new antibiotics is a long and expensive process, which is often unsuccessful. Therefore, it is essential to develop computational approaches to identify promising candidates early in the drug development process. Here, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. The best candidate was synthesized and tested in vitro and in vivo. The results show that the best compounds designed by us are active against antibiotic-resistant pathogens, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin. This approach can be used to develop new antibiotics in the future. (Show more)"

However, the number of trainable parameters in these networks is often large, and the number of parameters required to achieve accurate results is often not known. Here, we introduce a network architecture that is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters, and is easier to train and apply. The network architecture is based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data. The network architecture is simple to implement, train, and apply, and automatically adapts to different problems. We show that the proposed network architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data. We believe that the proposed network architecture will be useful for many image-processing problems."

We induced C-type inactivation in BK channels and studied the relationship between activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery. We found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability.

The virus is known to spread more efficiently in dry air, but the impact of dry air on host defense and disease outcome is not well understood. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes them more susceptible to severe disease following influenza challenge. We find that low humidity impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in mice deficient in caspase-1/11, an enzyme involved in tissue repair. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms of dry air-induced disease severity and may lead to the development of new strategies to combat influenza. (Show more)"

It is essential for maintaining intestinal homeostasis and preventing the invasion of pathogens. However, intestinal inflammation is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In this study, we found that retinoic acid-related orphan receptor α (RORα) plays an important role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis by attenuating nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcriptional activity. RORα deletion leads to excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. We propose that RORα/HDAC3-mediated attenuation of NF-κB signaling controls the balance of inflammatory responses, and therapeutic strategies targeting this epigenetic regulation could be beneficial to the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease.

There is an urgent need for novel and more efficient therapies, ideally targeting AML stem cells that are essential for maintaining the disease. We show here that monoclonal antibodies targeting the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This approach may be applicable to other cancers as well. (Show more)"

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR).

Here, we introduce a deep learning algorithm that efficiently enhances antibody affinity to achieve broader and more potent neutralizing activity against such variants. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a human antibody P36-5D2, which is effective against SARS-CoV-2 Alpha, Beta, and Gamma but not Delta. We show that our approach can identify CDR changes that alleviate the impact of two Omicron mutations on the epitope. These results highlight the power of our deep learning approach in antibody optimization and its potential application to engineering other protein molecules. Our optimized antibodies can potentially be developed into antibody drug candidates for current and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

We present the largest global synthesis of soil respiration measurements to date, which reveal no significant differences in the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration between warmed and control plots in most biomes. However, in colder biomes, respiration rates with and without experimental warming follow a Gaussian response, increasing with soil temperature up to a threshold of ∼25 °C, above which respiration rates decrease with further increases in temperature. This consistent decrease in temperature sensitivity at higher temperatures demonstrates that rising global temperatures may result in regionally variable responses in soil respiration, with colder climates being considerably more responsive to increased ambient temperatures compared with warmer regions. Our analysis adds a unique cross-biome perspective on the temperature response of soil respiration, information critical to improving our mechanistic understanding of how soil carbon dynamics change with climatic warming.

These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis remain unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated the impact of O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (EtdT) lesions on the transcription of a lacZ reporter gene. We found that the three regioisomeric EtdT lesions can induce distinct transcriptional stalling profiles and that the transcriptional lesion bypass routes are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The results from the present in vitro transcriptional studies are well correlated with in vivo transcriptional mutagenesis analysis. This work provides important mechanistic insights into transcriptional stalling, lesion bypass, and mutagenesis of alkylated DNA lesions. The findings are expected to provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced mutagenesis and transcriptional stalling in vivo.

We show that sequential proteolysis of MERS-CoV S proteins is required for virus infection into human lung-derived cells, but not into other cell types. This cell type-specific requirement for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence."

FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. (Show more)"

We show that Fe levels in the retina are critical for the redox state of the cell and the photoreceptor cell viability. We also show that Fe levels in the retina can be manipulated by the use of a chelator. This work provides a mechanistic understanding of the role of Fe in the retina and may lead to the development of new therapies for retinal disease. (Show more)

However, the evolution of specialization is often considered a dead end, as it is difficult to evolve morphological and functional optimizations in separate structures. Here we show that siphonophores, a group of pelagic cnidarians, are an exception to this rule. We show that siphonophores can evolve from generalists to specialists, and that specialists on one prey type can evolve into specialists on other prey types. Our findings help to understand the evolution of specialization, and how it has shaped the present-day food web."

The evolution of the human hand is a key topic in the study of human evolution. This study provides the earliest evidence for the evolution of a key feature of the human hand, the third metacarpal styloid process."

We have developed a small-molecule inhibitor of serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), a key enzyme in one-carbon metabolism. We show that this inhibitor is effective in blocking the growth of colon cancer xenografts in mice. We also show that this inhibitor is effective in inhibiting the growth of a panel of B-cell cancer cell lines, but is ineffective in inhibiting the growth of a panel of other cancer cell lines. This latter observation suggests that the one-carbon metabolism of B-cell cancer is more sensitive to inhibition than other cancer types."

However, the impact of deforestation on people’s diets is less well understood. We show that deforestation can have a negative impact on people’s diets, and that this can be mitigated by the presence of forests. This study has important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We hypothesize that the increase in subsoil compaction risk is a consequence of the increase in the total weight of farm vehicles, which is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods."
