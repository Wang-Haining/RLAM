However, the structure of hydrate with guest molecules is still not clear. Here, we report the structure of hydrate with neon. We synthesized neon hydrate at high pressure and temperature. The structure of neon hydrate is ice II-like. The guest neon atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels. The guest neon atoms have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The guest neon atoms are further constrained by interactions between adjacent neon atoms. The guest neon atoms vibrate mainly in planes perpendicular to D2O channels.

This definition is based on a set of axioms that are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. This work addresses a question raised in reconstruction programs such as those of von Neumann, Mackey, Piron, Abramsky, and Coecke. The categorical definition of quantum mechanics is a step toward a deeper understanding of the mathematical structure of quantum theory."

Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we compare the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results show that myxozoans are cnidarians and are a sister taxon to P. hydriforme. In addition, we find that myxozoans have one of the smallest reported animal genomes. This suggests that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This is likely to be a common feature of parasitic eukaryotes. Our results also suggest that the myxozoan life cycle was shaped by the need to reduce the size of the genome and gene content.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus is able to evade the host immune response by blocking interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral signaling. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes. We found that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1. Orf6 is required for its ability to block nuclear import of importin/karyopherin. We also show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. Our findings provide a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the host immune response. This knowledge may be useful to design new antiviral strategies.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1.

Earlier studies suggest that once the optimum growing temperature is exceeded, mean crop yields decline and the variability of yield increases even if interannual climate variability remains unchanged. Here, we use global datasets of maize production and climate variability combined with future temperature projections to quantify how yield variability will change in the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. We find that as the global mean temperature increases, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation (CV) of maize yields increases almost everywhere to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation (SD) of yields and a decrease in mean yields. For the top four maize-exporting countries, which account for 87% of global maize exports, the probability that they have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because species-level identification of plant foods is prohibitively difficult with traditional methods. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large herbivore species. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages. Our results highlight the importance of diet composition in determining species interactions. This may be particularly important in African savanna, where plant diversity is high and plant species are often difficult to distinguish.

These fragments are then transported to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes. This process may explain the missing plastic debris.

In humans, the number of children a woman can have is a major determinant of her quality of life. In contrast, the number of offspring produced by most mammals is limited by the mother’s energy reserves.

The cytopathological hallmark of MSA is the accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregates in affected oligodendrocytes. We show here that the inflammatory protease caspase-1 is responsible for the cleavage of α-syn at its C terminus. Caspase-1 inhibition by the prodrug VX-765 limits α-syn pathology and protects against α-syn-induced toxicity in vivo. These results suggest that VX-765 could be a promising candidate to achieve disease modification in synucleinopathies by limiting α-syn accumulation. This would be a major step forward in the treatment of MSA.

It controls vascular contractility, hemostasis, and inflammation and regulates the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products between circulating blood and tissue. To control each function, the endothelium processes endlessly arriving requests from multiple sources using separate clusters of cells specialized to detect specific stimuli. A well-developed but poorly understood communication system operates between cells to integrate multiple lines of information and coordinate endothelial responses. Here, the nature of the communication network has been addressed using single-cell Ca2+ imaging across thousands of endothelial cells in intact blood vessels. Cell activities were cross-correlated and compared to a stochastic model to determine network connections. Highly correlated Ca2+ activities occurred in scattered cell clusters, and network communication links between them exhibited unexpectedly short path lengths. The number of connections between cells (degree distribution) followed a power-law relationship revealing a scale-free network topology. The path length and degree distribution revealed an endothelial network with a “small-world” configuration. The small-world configuration confers particularly dynamic endothelial properties including high signal-propagation speed, stability, and a high degree of synchronizability.

This allosteric coupling underlies C-type inactivation coupled to activation gating in this ion-channel family. We have identified the second Threonine residue within the TTVGYGD signature sequence of K+ channels as a crucial residue for this allosteric communication. A Threonine to Alanine substitution at this position was studied in three representative members of the K+-channel family. Interestingly, all of the mutant channels exhibited lack of C-type inactivation gating and an inversion of their allosteric coupling (i.e., closing of the activation gate collapses the channel’s selectivity filter). A state-dependent crystallographic study of KcsA-T75A proves that, on activation, the selectivity filter transitions from a nonconductive and deep C-type inactivated conformation to a conductive one. Finally, we provide a crystallographic demonstration that closed-state inactivation can be achieved by the structural collapse of the channel’s selectivity filter.

However, whether personality traits may predispose individuals to a particular rank remains unclear. Here we show that anxiety directly influences social dominance in male outbred rats. We identify an important mediating role for mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens. High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduces social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevents the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious individuals. We conclude that mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens is crucial for social hierarchy establishment and that brain energy metabolism is a potential marker and avenue of treatment for anxiety-related social disorders.

Within the structures, different materials play distinct roles yet seamlessly collaborate through sophisticated deformation mechanisms to produce the target behaviors. The synthesized structures are effectively manufactured via multimaterial fabrication with different elastomers with distinct behaviors. The highly nonlinear responses are physically and accurately realized. The proposed strategy can be utilized to design function-oriented and situation-specific mechanical devices for a wide range of applications.

The hemoglobin expression pattern in human erythroblasts is heterochronic, with fetal hemoglobin (HbF) being expressed at higher levels than adult hemoglobin (HbA). Here we show that the insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) is a key player in this heterochronous regulation. IGF2BP1 is expressed in adult erythroblasts and is down-regulated in fetal erythroblasts. In addition, IGF2BP1 is a negative regulator of fetal hemoglobin expression.

In this study, we found that the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis protects cancer cells from ferroptosis, a form of regulated necrosis driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. This resistance is mediated by the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and the fatty acid desaturase stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1). We also found that SREBP1 and SCD1 are central regulators of ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells. In preclinical models, we demonstrated that combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction is a promising approach for cancer therapy.

The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice, and automatically adapts to different problems. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data.

However, the evolutionary history of beetles remains poorly understood. We used a comprehensive dataset of 89 genes to estimate the timing and rates of beetle diversification. We also traced the evolution of genes enabling symbiont-independent digestion of plant cell walls. Phylogenomic analyses of these datasets resolved controversial beetle relationships and revealed that plant cell wall-degrading enzymes were key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles. We propose that these genes enabled efficient digestion of plant tissues, including lignocellulose in cell walls, facilitating the evolution of uniquely specialized plant-feeding habits, such as leaf mining and stem and wood boring. Beetle diversity thus appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding PCWDEs. This study provides a framework for understanding the evolution of beetles. It also provides a model for understanding the evolution of other groups.

The disease is characterized by progressive loss of sensation and disfigurement. The disease is curable with multidrug therapy. However, the disease is still prevalent in some regions of the world. The causative agent of the disease, Mycobacterium lepromatosis, is not known. We sequenced the genome of M. lepromatosis from a patient in Mexico. We compared the genome with that of M. leprae. We also performed a phylogeographic survey of leprosy patients. We found that M. lepromatosis is more closely related to the MRCA of Mycobacterium than is M. leprae. This suggests that M. lepromatosis may be a more recent pathogen."

At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. These data suggest that TRAP1 may act as a tumor suppressor."

ADF/cofilin is the best-characterized member of this family. It is a dynamic protein that binds to actin filaments and can sever them. However, how it does so remains unclear. Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to study the action of ADF/cofilin in different mechanical situations. We find that ADF/cofilin prefers to sever filaments in curved situations. Surprisingly, tension has no effect on ADF/cofilin binding and weakly enhances severing. We also find that ADF/cofilin-induced filament curvature enhances severing. A simple model, which faithfully recapitulates our experimental observations, indicates that the ADF/cofilin-induced curvature increases the severing rate constant 100-fold. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. We propose that it is the key to understanding how ADF/co"

The virus that causes most colds is rhinovirus. Rhinovirus replicates more robustly at the cool temperatures found in the nasal cavity than at core body temperature. We show that mouse airway cells infected with rhinovirus exhibit a striking enrichment in expression of antiviral defense response genes at 37 °C relative to 33 °C. This correlates with higher expression levels of type I and type III IFN genes and ISGs at 37 °C. Rhinovirus replication is also higher at 37 °C. These findings suggest that the cool temperature of the nasal cavity may be an adaptation of rhinovirus to optimize its growth. The temperature-dependent growth phenotype of rhinovirus may be a mechanism for evasion of antiviral defense at cool temperatures.

In bacteria, Np4 decapping is mediated by ApaH, a pyrophosphohydrolase that prefers to remove the terminal nucleoside triphosphate over the corresponding di- and monophosphate. Here, we show that the RNA pyrophosphohydrolase RppH, which is inactivated by Np4-capped RNA, is the predominant decapping enzyme in cells experiencing disulfide stress. We demonstrate that RppH decaps Np4-capped RNA by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to decaps other 5′ termini. The unusual manner in which Np4-capped RNA binds to the active site of RppH positions the δ-phosphate, rather than the β-phosphate, for hydrolytic attack, generating triphosphorylated RNA as the primary product of decapping.

The mechanisms involved in the development of immunosuppression during sepsis are not fully understood. We hypothesized that increasing arginine availability would restore T cell function and decrease immunosuppression. We found that citrulline, a nonessential amino acid, was more efficient than arginine in increasing arginine plasma levels and restoring T cell mitochondrial function and proliferation while reducing immunosuppression. Because there is no specific therapeutic strategy to restore immune function after sepsis, we believe that our study provides evidence for developing citrulline-based clinical studies in sepsis. This study also provides a rationale for the use of citrulline in cancer. In fact, arginine deprivation is a common feature of many cancers. In addition, citrulline is a substrate for the arginase enzyme, which is overexpressed in many cancers. Therefore, citrulline could be a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer. In addition, citrulline is a precursor of the antitumor immune response. In fact, the antitumor immune response is based on the production of citrullinated antigens. Therefore, citrulline could be a promising strategy for cancer. In conclusion, we believe that our study provides evidence"

We induced C-type inactivation in BK channels and studied the relationship between activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery.

Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition.

The auditory organs of animals are all part of the body. Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. We find that the spider’s web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to sense the motion of web threads. By sensing the motion of web threads, the spider remotely detects and localizes the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously. The outsourcing and supersizing of auditory function in spiders provide unique features for studying extended and regenerative sensing and designing novel acoustic flow detectors for precise fluid dynamic measurement and manipulation. This study provides a unique example of outsourcing and supersizing of hearing. It also provides a unique example of outsourcing and supersizing of any sensory function.

We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4.

We now show that Anaplasma induces ticks to express antifreeze glycoprotein (IAFG), which alters the gut microbiota. IAFGP binds the terminal d-alanine residue of the peptidoglycan pentapeptide chain, resulting in altered permeability and the capacity of bacteria to form biofilms. These data elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which a human pathogen appropriates an arthropod antibacterial protein to alter the gut microbiota and more effectively colonize the vector.

The short-tailed bird group (Pygostylia) is a major evolutionary lineage that is thought to have contributed to the evolution of the modern avian body plan. However, the known diversity of early members of Pygostylia is limited. Here, we describe a basal member of Pygostylia, Jinguofortis perplexus, from the Early Cretaceous of China. Jinguofortis is the second earliest diverging member of Pygostylia. The discovery of Jinguofortis increases the known ecomorphological diversity of basal pygostylians and highlights the importance of developmental plasticity for understanding mosaic evolution in early birds. The presence of a fused scapulocoracoid in adult individuals independently evolved in Jinguofortisidae and Confuciusornithiformes may relate to an accelerated osteogenesis during chondrogenesis and likely formed through the heterochronic process of peramorphosis by these basal taxa.

This comes from analysis of observations showing that stratospheric water vapor increases with tropospheric temperature, implying the existence of a stratospheric water vapor feedback. We estimate the strength of this feedback in a chemistry–climate model to be +0.3 W/(m2⋅K), which would be a significant contributor to the overall climate sensitivity. One-third of this feedback comes from increases in water vapor entering the stratosphere through the tropical tropopause layer, with the rest coming from increases in water vapor entering through the extratropical tropopause. This finding is important for understanding the causes of past climate change. It also suggests that stratospheric water vapor may be a useful indicator of future climate change. This is because stratospheric water vapor is a key player in the climate system and its variations are expected to increase in a warming climate. This is a significant finding for climate science. It suggests that we should pay more attention to stratospheric water vapor. It also suggests that we should be more careful about the interpretation of past climate change.

ALKBH5 expression is induced by hypoxia, and ALKBH5-dependent demethylation of NANOG mRNA at an m6A residue in the 3′-UTR. ALKBH5-dependent NANOG mRNA demethylation and NANOG protein expression are HIF-dependent. ALKBH5 expression increases the percentage of BCSCs and decreases the number of BCSCs.

This suggests that ultrafine vellum does not necessarily derive from the use of abortive or newborn animals with ultrathin hides.

We used a grid-based approach to sample the genomic diversity across Madagascar. We find a common Bantu and Austronesian ancestry for all Malagasy individuals. We also find that the settlement of Madagascar happened recently, with a limited contribution of Europeans and Middle Easterners. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across Madagascar reveals that the settlement was not homogeneous. Finally, we find that a few centuries are sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. This suggests that Madagascar is a unique place to study the impact of human activities on the genetic diversity of human populations."

As an alternative approach, extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying the convergence of the targets and functions of the autism-risk genes to facilitate mapping out causal paths. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting.

The band structures of the 2D photonic crystals are predicted to produce unconventional atom–light interaction behaviors, including anisotropic emission, suppressed spontaneous decay, and photon-mediated atom–atom interactions controlled by the position of the atomic array relative to the photonic crystal. The device configuration also enables application of optical tweezers for controlled placement of atoms. Devices can be fabricated reliably from a 200-nm silicon nitride device layer using a lithography-based process, producing predicted optical properties in transmission and reflection measurements. These 2D photonic crystal devices can be readily deployed to experiments for many-body physics with neutral atoms and engineering of exotic quantum matter.

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis remain unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We found that pol II stalling at O2-EtdT and N3-EtdT sites is exacerbated by TFIIS-stimulated proofreading activity.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Virions must first be cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. We found that the first cleavages of MERS-CoV S proteins compromised infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence.

Their genome is segmented into eight fragments, which offers evolutionary advantages but complicates genomic packaging. The existence of a selective packaging mechanism, in which one copy of each viral RNA is specifically packaged into each virion, is suspected, but its molecular details remain unknown. Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus. This interaction takes place in infected cells and is required for optimal viral replication. Disruption of this interaction decreased the amount of viral RNA in the viral particles, resulting in an eightfold increase in empty viral particles. This interaction is not widely conserved among influenza A virus. The lack of conservation might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses. Our results provide a molecular explanation for the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome. They also suggest that this interaction might be a target for antiviral therapy.

However, human activities have greatly increased the spatial and seasonal extent of wildfire in the United States. This has led to a substantial increase in the economic and ecological costs of wildfire. We show that human activities have expanded the geographic and seasonal extent of wildfire. We also show that human-caused wildfires disproportionately occur in areas where fuel moisture is higher than lightning-caused wildfires. This suggests that human-caused wildfires may be more difficult to suppress. We recommend that efforts to reduce wildfire risk should focus on reducing the human-caused fire niche. This can be achieved by raising awareness of the risks of human-caused wildfires and by increasing management in regions where human-caused wildfires are dominant. This will reduce the economic and ecological costs of wildfire."

The recent outbreak has prompted global concern. Here we present a mathematical analysis of the within-host dynamics of ZIKV in a nonhuman primate model. We estimate that the eclipse phase for ZIKV is short, the rate of viral production is rapid, and the lifetime of an infected cell while producing virus is long. We also estimate that the minimum number of virions produced by an infected cell over its lifetime is ∼5,500. We assess the potential effect of an antiviral treatment that blocks viral replication. We show that the median time to undetectable plasma viral load can be reduced from ∼5 d to ∼3 d with a drug concentration ∼15 times the drug’s EC50 when treatment is given prophylactically starting at the time of infection. In the case of favipiravir, a polymerase inhibitor with activity against ZIKV, we predict a dose of 150 mg/kg given twice a day initiated at the time of infection can reduce the peak median viral load by ∼3 logs and shorten the time to undetectable median"

However, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Here, we show that altered nutrient cycling during heat stress is a primary driver of the functional breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis. Heat stress increased the metabolic energy demand of the coral host, which was compensated by the catabolic degradation of amino acids. The resulting shift from net uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont subsequently promoted the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host. Energy limitation and altered symbiotic nutrient cycling are thus key factors in the early heat stress response, directly contributing to the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis. Interpreting the stability of the coral holobiont in light of its metabolic interactions provides a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

We identify a mechanism by which the activity of JNK signaling can be controlled to maintain intestinal homeostasis.

ROR1 expression also enhanced the capacity of breast cancer cells to invade Matrigel, form spheroids, engraft in Rag2−/−γc−/− mice, or survive treatment with paclitaxel. Treatment of mice bearing breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) with the humanized anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab repressed expression of genes associated with breast cancer stemness, reduced activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or BMI1, and impaired the capacity of breast cancer PDXs to metastasize or reengraft Rag2−/−γc−/− mice. Finally, treatment of PDX-bearing mice with cirmtuzumab and paclitaxel was more effective than treatment with either alone in eradicating breast cancer PDXs.

This triggered a rapid advance of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and a global sea-level rise. The Mount Takahe eruption is the only known volcanic event in the Southern Hemisphere during the last deglaciation.

However, they are often overlooked in conservation and management. We derive a global map of riverine fisheries and use it to assess the role of inland fisheries in food security. We find that 90% of global catch comes from river basins with above-average stress levels. Fish richness and catches are positively but not causally correlated, revealing that fishing pressure is most intense in rivers where potential impacts on biodiversity are highest. Merging our catch analysis with nutritional and socioeconomic data, we find that inland fisheries provide the equivalent of all dietary animal protein for 158 million people. This highlights the critical role of rivers in providing locally sourced, low-cost protein. At the same time, intensive fishing in regions where rivers are already degraded by other stressors may undermine efforts to conserve biodiversity. This syndrome of poverty, nutritional deficiency, fishery dependence, and extrinsic threats to biodiverse river ecosystems underscores the high stakes for improving fishery management. Our enhanced spatial data on estimated catches can facilitate the inclusion of inland fisheries in environmental planning to protect both food security and species diversity.

These findings suggest that the mechanisms that control ectopic axon growth in C. elegans are also involved in the control of regeneration in the adult CNS.

In both cases, the process is accomplished by homologous recombination, in which DNA is copied from one chromosome to the other. Here, we describe the distribution of recombination across the genome of a flowering plant. We find that recombination is concentrated in hotspots, and that hotspots are largely conserved across species.

Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

The biosynthesis of the volatile nitrogen-containing compounds is not known. We report the identification of a gene (SlTNH1) essential for the production of all the detectable nitrogenous volatiles in tomato fruit. The gene encodes a flavin-dependent monooxygenase that catalyzes sequential hydroxylation of 2-substituted tetrahydrothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid substrates. This pathway is unique to tomato and likely contributes to the flavor of tomato fruit. The identification of this pathway will enable the development of improved tomato cultivars with enhanced flavor. This work will also advance our understanding of the evolution of nitrogenous volatiles in the Solanaceae. The gene is available for plant transformation.

However, these threats are frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we use high-throughput experiments to show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. Our work highlights the importance of considering the combined effects of biodiversity loss and environmental warming on ecosystem functioning. This is critical for understanding the magnitude of the threat to Earth’s ecosystems. It is also critical for developing effective conservation strategies."

We found that grid cells, which encode the animal’s spatial position, are organized in a distinct manner from border, head-direction, and object-vector cells. These data provide a map of the organization of MEC neurons in the brain. They also provide a framework for understanding how these neurons are organized in the context of the animal’s environment.

The flowering signal FT is also required for dodder flowering. This study demonstrates that FTs can function as an important interplant flowering signal in host–dodder interactions. The unique means of flowering regulation of dodder illustrates how regressive evolution, commonly found in parasites, may facilitate the physiological synchronization of parasite and host, here allowing the C. australis parasite to time reproduction exactly with that of their hosts. This may be an important mechanism for parasite fitness. This study also shows that FTs can function as an important interplant flowering signal.

Here we show that striatonigral fibers originating in striosomes form highly unusual bouquet-like arborizations that target bundles of ventrally extending dopamine-containing dendrites and clusters of their parent nigral cell bodies. These clustered cell bodies in turn project to the striatum as part of the classic nigrostriatal pathway. Thus, these striosome–dendron bouquets likely represent subsystems with the nigro–striato–nigral loop that are affected in human disorders including Parkinson’s disease. Given evidence that striosomes receive input from cortical regions related to the control of mood and motivation and that they link functionally to reinforcement and decision-making, the striosome–dendron bouquets could be critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease. This work suggests that striosomes are more than just a small subregion of the substantia nigra pars compacta. They are a distinct system with a unique morphology and function. This work also provides a method for studying the morphology of individual striatonigral fibers. This method could be used to study other types of nigral fibers.

But how do we know when we’re feeling connected? We asked people to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Finally, we demonstrate that this signal is used by third-party listeners as a heuristic of how well people are connected: Conversations with faster response times were perceived as more connected than the same conversations with slower response times. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.” This may be why we click."

We report that STIM1 is a multifunctional regulator of Ca2+ dynamics in SANCs. STIM1 regulates Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) by linking SR Ca2+ store content with electrical events occurring in the plasma membrane. In addition, STIM1 influences SAN function by regulating ionic fluxes in SANCs. These studies reveal that STIM1 is a multifunctional regulator of Ca2+ dynamics in SANCs that links SR Ca2+ store content with electrical events occurring in the plasma membrane, thereby contributing to automaticity of the SAN.

The cellular lipidome was markedly changed in a parallel way by modulation of alkylglycerol monooxygenase expression and of tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis. Alkylglycerol monooxygenase activity manipulation modulated the IFN-γ/lipopolysaccharide–induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, interleukin-1β, and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist but not transforming growth factor β1, suggesting that alkylglycerol monooxygenase activity affects IFN-γ/lipopolysaccharide signaling. Our results demonstrate a central role of tetrahydrobiopterin and alkylglycerol monooxygenase in ether lipid metabolism of murine macrophages and reveal that alteration of alkylglycerol monooxygenase activity has a profound impact on the lipidome also beyond the class of ether lipids.

However, the 235 tributaries that drain the lake delivered 80% of the daily dissolved inorganic nutrient loads. These dissolved inorganic nutrients are more bioavailable to algae, increasing the potential for coastal eutrophication.

We show that this behavior is a consequence of the interplay between the network dynamics and the environment. We also show that the network can be made to exhibit this behavior by tuning the environment. This behavior may be useful for the design of synthetic chemical systems. Our work is motivated by the recent experimental observation of a similar behavior in a synthetic chemical network. Our work also provides a theoretical explanation for this behavior.

They are considered a model system for studying morphological specialization. However, the evolution of specialization in siphonophores has been considered a dead end. We show that siphonophore specialization is not a dead end, but rather a process that has led to the evolution of modularity in the tentacles. We show that the evolution of modularity in the tentacles has allowed siphonophores to evolve into generalists. This modularity is linked to the evolution of prey type. Our results help us understand how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs.

The fossil record for the hominin hand between 800,000 and 1.8 My old is sparse. We report the discovery of a hominin hand fossil from West Turkana, Kenya, that provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key derived characteristic of the modern human hand. This finding suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo. This finding also suggests that the evolution of the modern human hand may have begun in the genus Homo. This is an important finding for understanding the evolution of the human hand and the hominin lineage leading to Neandertals and modern humans. The fossil is also the earliest known hominin from Kenya. This is an important finding for understanding the hominin fossil record in East Africa. The fossil is named Kaitio I and is assigned a new species, Australopithecus afarensis kaitioensis. The fossil is assigned a new hominin genus, Ardipithecus. The hominin genus Ardipithecus is assigned a"

Mammalian cells have two SHMT isozymes, SHMT1 and SHMT2. SHMT2 is strongly up-regulated in cancer. Here we show that dual SHMT1/2 knockout blocks HCT-116 colon cancer tumor xenograft formation. We identify small-molecule dual inhibitors of human SHMT1/2. We show that formate generally rescues cells from SHMT inhibition, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We show that this effect is rooted in defective glycine uptake in DLBCL cell lines, rendering them uniquely dependent upon SHMT enzymatic activity to meet glycine demand. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of DLBCL. This work provides a rationale for targeting SHMT in cancer. It also provides a rationale for targeting formate dehydrogenase in cancer."

We show that deforestation in rural Tanzania led to a reduction in people’s fruit and vegetable consumption and thus vitamin A adequacy. Conversely, forest fragmentation led to an increase in fruit and vegetable consumption and dietary vitamin A adequacy. These findings have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. This study also highlights the importance of using a causal modeling approach to understand the effects of deforestation on people’s diets. This approach can be used to test causal hypotheses and to make causal inferences. This is particularly important in the social sciences. We believe that this approach should be used more widely in the social sciences. We hope that this study will encourage others to do so."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. We conclude that the mechanical footprint of sauropods may have been as large as that of modern farm machinery. This study calls for a reexamination of the ecological role"
