Here, we report the genomes of two myxozoans, Kudoa iwatai and Myxobolus cerebralis, and compare them to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. We find that myxozoans are cnidarians and are a sister taxon to the more complex P. hydriforme. We also find that myxozoans are among the most reduced animals in terms of genome size and gene content. These results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides a unique resource for studying the evolution of the Myxozoa and the transition from a free-living to parasitic lifestyle. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to block nuclear import of IFN-stimulated factors (ISFs), which are key effectors of the IFN antiviral response. We found that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the host immune response and may help in the development of new strategies to combat the ongoing pandemic.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of proton channels, but the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels is not completely understood. Here, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species of wild and domestic LMH in semiarid African savanna. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers. Grass consumption was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of % grass consumption, indicating that RRA conveys reliable quantitative information about consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.

However, the magnitude of the problem is still debated. We show that the global load of floating plastic debris is far less than expected, mostly because of size-selective sinks. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. This sink is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean.

The hemoglobin system is also a target of the heterochronic let-7 miRNA pathway. Here we show that the insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) is a downstream element of the let-7 pathway and that its expression is developmentally regulated in human erythroid tissues. We demonstrate that IGF2BP1 can mediate the reversal of the adult hemoglobin expression pattern toward a more fetal-like phenotype. This is achieved by increased gamma-globin combined with decreased beta-globin transcripts resulting in gamma-globin rising to 90% of total beta-like mRNA. Delta-globin mRNA is reduced to barely detectable levels. Alpha-globin levels are not significantly changed. These results suggest a mechanism for chronoregulation of fetal and adult hemoglobin expression in humans. This mechanism may be relevant for the development of hemoglobinopathies and for the treatment of anemia.

Furthermore, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a transcriptional target of SREBP1, mediates the ferroptosis-suppressing activity of SREBP1 by producing monounsaturated fatty acids. Genetic or pharmacologic ablation of SREBP1 or SCD1 sensitized ferroptosis in cancer cells with PI3K-AKT-m"

The treatment of hypertension is the cornerstone of cardiovascular disease management. The most common drugs for treating hypertension are the voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs). However, the use of LCCBs is associated with the development of heart failure. Here, we show that LCCBs activate the STIM/ORAI Ca2+ signaling pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells, which is a key regulator of vascular remodeling. Our findings may help to explain the association of LCCBs with heart failure and may help to develop new strategies for the treatment of hypertension."

We used &gt;25 years of bird surveys to test whether the NWFP was successful in halting the decline of older-forest–associated birds and stabilizing early-seral–associated birds. We found that the NWFP halted the decline of early-seral–associated birds, but failed to halt the decline of older-forest–associated birds. The NWFP also failed to stabilize older-forest–associated bird populations, which continued to decline. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure. Our findings also highlight the importance of monitoring the effects of policies on biodiversity.

The development of new antibiotics is a major challenge, and computational approaches are essential tools to this end. Here, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. This study provides a proof of concept for the rational design of new antibiotics. The approach presented here can be extended to other antibiotic classes. This will help to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens and to address the problem of antibiotic resistance. (Show more)"

The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data. This architecture can be easily extended to other problems and is expected to be useful in many other applications."

We found that larger populations generated greater variation in plane performance and gave participants access to better-adapted planes, but this did not enhance CCE. In fact, there was an inverse relationship between population size and CCE: plane flight distance did not improve over the experimental generations in the 2-Model and 4-Model conditions, but did improve over generations in the 1-Model social-learning condition.

The model can be used to explore the impact of different transmission pathways on the spread of the disease. This is particularly important for diseases that are still circulating, such as plague. The model can also be used to explore the impact of control measures, such as the use of rats as carriers of plague. This is particularly important for diseases that are still circulating, such as plague. Finally, the model can be used to explore the impact of climate change on"

However, the evolution of brain neuronal density, which is the brain’s computational power, has been largely ignored. This study fills this gap by reconstructing the evolution of brain neuronal density across amniotes, from the most primitive reptiles to the most advanced birds and mammals. We show that reptiles have not only small brains relative to body size but also low neuronal densities, resulting in average neuron numbers over 20 times lower than those in birds and mammals of similar body size. This study also shows that the evolution of brain neuronal density is associated with the evolution of cognitive ability. These findings have important implications for studies using relative brain size as a proxy when looking for evolutionary drivers of animal cognition. They also provide a new perspective on the evolution of the human brain."

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal cells is not well understood. We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor.

The distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population.

We use a quantitative approach to test the hypothesis that aquatic mammals are driven toward a common size attractor. We find that the evolution of an aquatic lifestyle is driving three of the four extant aquatic mammal clades toward a size attractor at ∼500 kg. The existence of this body size attractor and the relatively rapid selection toward, and limited deviation from, this attractor rule out most hypothesized drivers of size increase. These three independent body size increases and a shared aquatic optimum size are consistent with control by differences in the scaling of energetic intake and cost functions with body size between the terrestrial and aquatic realms. The optimum size occurs at an intermediate value where thermoregulatory costs are low but feeding efficiency remains high. Rather than being released from size pressures, water-dwelling mammals are driven and confined to larger body sizes by the strict energetic demands of the aquatic medium. This study provides a quantitative test of the hypothesis that the evolution of an aquatic lifestyle is driving the evolution of a common body size attractor. This hypothesis is important for understanding the evolution of body size in mammals and the evolution of body size in other aquatic organisms. It"

These results are supported further by an extensive survey of faunal remains from 234 sites in the Southern Levant, spanning more than three millennia, which shows a sharp increase in the frequency of chicken during the Hellenistic period. We further argue that the earliest secure evidence for economic exploitation of chickens in Europe dates to the first century B.C.E. and therefore is predated by the finds in the Southern Levant by at least a century.

SOC systems are characterized by a critical state, where the system activity is maximal and all attempts to change the activity level are suppressed. The critical state is maintained by feedback mechanisms, which are triggered by the system activity. The feedback mechanisms are in turn regulated by the activity level. This feedback loop is the key to the self-regulation of the system activity. The feedback mechanisms are often based on a simple rule, which is applied to the system activity. The simplest example is the sandpile model, where the system activity is the number of unstable sites and the feedback rule is the addition of the weight of the unstable site to the activity of the system. In this paper, we study the sandpile model in the thermodynamic limit. We show that the model exhibits a phase transition between a critical state and a noncritical state.

We here present a method for determining the temperature of the surface of the Earth in the past based on the thermostability of ancestral enzymes. Our results suggest that Earth’s surface temperature decreased over geological time from ∼65–80 °C in the Archean, a finding consistent both with previous isotope-based and protein reconstruction-based interpretations.

Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the impact of ambient humidity on influenza virus infection and disease outcome, and suggest that dry air may be a modifiable risk factor for influenza virus infection.

This merge operation is applied equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity, and it is consistent with a neural implementation of a left-corner parser. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases.

We find that women’s and men’s endorsement of HM predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. In addition, as conceptualized, HM was associated with less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors. The findings highlight the importance of psychological examinations of masculinity as a cultural ideology to understand how men’s and women’s endorsement of HM legitimizes patriarchal dominance and reinforces gender, race, and class-based hierarchies via candidate support.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. First, whereas MERS-CoV prefers human DPP4 over bat DPP4 as its receptor, HKU4 shows the opposite trend. Second, in the absence of exogenous proteases, both MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes mediate pseudovirus entry into bat cells, whereas only MERS-CoV spike, but not HKU4 spike, mediates pseudovirus entry into human cells.

The age model for this event is critical for understanding the causes and consequences of extinction and recovery. We present a precise age model for the extinction based on U-Pb dates from volcanic ash beds. The age of the extinction is constrained to 251.941 ± 0.037 and 251.880 ± 0.031 Mya, an interval of 60 ± 48 ka. The carbon cycle underwent a major reorganization immediately preceding the extinction, and carbon cycle volatility persisted for ∼500 ka before a return to near preextinction values. The age model presented here will allow a refined evaluation of the relative roles of rate-dependent processes contributing to the extinction, allowing insight into postextinction ecosystem expansion. This work will also allow a more precise evaluation of the trigger and kill hypotheses. (Show more)"

RORα is involved in various biological processes, including cancer, metabolism, and circadian rhythm. However, the role of RORα in the intestinal epithelium is still unclear. Here, we generated intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific RORα-deficient mice and found that RORα is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis by attenuating nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcriptional activity. RORαΔIEC mice exhibit excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis reveals corecruitment of RORα and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) on NF-κB target promoters and subsequent dismissal of CREB binding protein (CBP) and bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) for transcriptional repression.

The distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population.

Photosynthesis relies on these modified tetrapyrroles for the capture of solar radiation and its conversion to chemical energy. The formation of the isocyclic fifth ring, the key reaction in the biosynthesis of chlorophyll, has remained enigmatic for more than 60 y. This reaction is catalyzed by two unrelated cyclase enzymes using different chemistries. The majority of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria use BchE, an O2-sensitive [4Fe-4S] cluster protein, whereas plants, cyanobacteria, and some phototrophic bacteria possess an O2-dependent enzyme, the major catalytic component of which is a diiron protein, AcsF. Plant and cyanobacterial mutants in ycf54 display impaired function of the O2-dependent enzyme, accumulating the reaction substrate. Swapping cyclases between cyanobacteria and purple phototrophic bacteria reveals three classes of the O2-dependent enzyme. AcsF is the cyclase in R. gelatinosus, whereas alphaproteobacterial cyclases require a newly discovered protein that we term BciE, encoded by a gene conserved"

In this study, we generated conditional knockout (CKO) mice that lack ASK1 in T cells, dendritic cells, microglia/macrophages, microglia, or astrocytes, to assess the roles of ASK1 during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We found that ASK1 deficiency in microglia/macrophages ameliorated the early-stage neuroinflammation, whereas deficiency in astrocytes ameliorated the later-stage neuroinflammation. ASK1 signaling in microglia/macrophages activated astrocytes to exacerbate neuroinflammation, and astrocyte-specific ASK1 deletion reduced disease severity.

Therefore, it is difficult to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a molecular mechanism of autism-risk genes and a potential target for drug development.

However, STING deficiency in β-cells impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, suggesting a possible role of STING in β-cell dysfunction. Indeed, STING deficiency decreased expression of β-cell function–related genes, including Glut2, Kcnj11, and Abcc8, contributing to impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Mechanistically, the transcription factor Pax6 was down-regulated and its nuclear localization was lost in STING-deficient β-cells.

Their genome is segmented into eight fragments, which offers evolutionary advantages but complicates genomic packaging. The existence of a selective packaging mechanism, in which one copy of each viral RNA is specifically packaged into each virion, is suspected, but its molecular details remain unknown. Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus using in vitro experiments. Using silent trans-complementary mutants, we then demonstrated that this interaction takes place in infected cells and is required for optimal viral replication. Disruption of this interaction did not affect the HA titer of the mutant viruses, suggesting that the same amount of viral particles was produced. However, it nonspecifically decreased the amount of viral RNA in the viral particles, resulting in an eightfold increase in empty viral particles. Competition experiments indicated that this interaction favored copackaging of the interacting viral RNA segments. The interaction we identified involves regions not previously designated as packaging signals and is not widely conserved among influenza A virus.

Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host.

Here, we identify a form of regeneration that is remarkably independent of the canonical MAPK signaling pathway, which is known to mediate regeneration in the adult nervous system. This discovery unites disparate forms of ectopic axon growth to uncover fresh molecular insights into activity-dependent control of the adult nervous system’s intrinsic regenerative capacity.

In this study, we describe the distribution of recombination across the genome of a flowering plant, Mimulus guttatus, and compare it to that of a mouse mutant in which the rate of recombination is reduced. We find that the rate of recombination varies widely across the genome, with some regions exhibiting no recombination at all. The distribution of recombination is similar to that in yeast and in mice lacking a positive-regulatory domain zinc finger protein 9. These results provide a detailed view of the recombination landscape in a flowering plant and suggest that the ancient mechanisms of recombination initiation are conserved in eukaryotes.

This hypothesis has been tested using functional MRI, but the results are difficult to interpret because of the large number of networks that are activated in response to external stimuli. We used metabolic PET to identify and validate reproducible RSN topographies in healthy and disease populations. We found that the dominant RSN was topographically similar to the default mode network (DMN) in healthy subjects. In contrast, in Parkinson’s disease (PD), this RSN was subordinated to an independent disease-related pattern. Network functionality was assessed by quantifying metabolic RSN expression in cerebral blood flow PET scans acquired at rest and during task performance. We observed that the DMN was deactivated during rest in healthy subjects and early PD patients, and that this abnormality was partially corrected by dopaminergic therapy. In contrast, in Alzheimer’s disease, significant reductions in network expression were already present at diagnosis, progressing over time.

We show that NAD-RNA is found on subsets of nuclear and mitochondrial encoded mRNAs. NAD-RNA appears to be produced cotranscriptionally because NAD-RNA is also found on pre-mRNAs, and only on mitochondrial transcripts that are not 5′ end processed.

However, the role of FSIP1 in the progression and drug sensitivity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. This article is protected by copyright.

In the present study, we found that some, but not all, alcohol-dependent subjects developed gut leakiness, which was associated with higher scores of depression, anxiety, and alcohol craving after 3 wk of abstinence. Moreover, subjects with increased gut permeability also had altered composition and activity of the gut microbiota. These results suggest the existence of a gut–brain axis in alcohol dependence, which implicates the gut microbiota as an actor in the gut barrier and in behavioral disorders. Thus, the gut microbiota seems to be a previously unidentified target in the management of alcohol dependence.

Here we use high-throughput experiments to show that the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is sensitive to changes in temperature. We found that the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning becomes steeper as temperatures deviate from ambient conditions, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This result is driven by two processes linked to the thermal tolerance of taxa. First, more diverse communities are more likely to contain species with thermal traits that enable them to maintain productivity as temperatures shift from ambient conditions. Second, we found a pronounced increase in the contribution of complementarity to the net biodiversity effect at high and low temperatures, indicating that changes in species interactions played a critical role in mediating the impacts of temperature change on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. This work highlights the importance of considering the combined effects of biodiversity loss and environmental warming on ecosystem functioning.

This system, termed “striosome–dendron bouquets,” is formed by striosomes, which are newly discovered specialized cell bodies in the substantia nigra, and dopamine-containing dendrites, which extend from the ventral surface of the nigral cell bodies. The bouquets are formed by striosomal fibers tightly intertwined with dopamine-containing dendrites and also with a variety of other cell types. We suggest that the striosome–dendron bouquets are critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease.

This work offers mechanistic insights into the circuit-level dysfunction induced by the presence of an antibody against the NMDA receptor. These findings may help to identify the mechanisms underlying the paroxysmal EEG abnormalities in other autoimmune encephalitis. This work also offers a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of these disorders.

Here, we present a study of an abrupt climate change event that occurred during a glacial period. We show that this event was accompanied by a doubling of atmospheric CO2 and a biodiversity nadir. We also show that this event was linked to an injection of organic matter–derived carbon into the ocean and to an increase in nutrient fluxes. These results provide insights into the mechanisms that can lead to abrupt climate change and the potential for future abrupt climate change. This article is protected by copyright.

Certification is the tool most used to fulfill these procurement policies, and around 20% of global palm oil production is certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). However, the effect of certification on deforestation in oil palm plantations remains unclear. Here, we use a comprehensive dataset of RSPO-certified and noncertified oil palm plantations in Indonesia, as well as annual remotely sensed metrics of tree cover loss and fire occurrence, to evaluate the impact of certification on deforestation and fire. Our results suggest that certification reduced deforestation in oil palm plantations. Nevertheless, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. This study highlights the importance of certification in forested regions and the need for certification to be tightly monitored. This is especially important in the context"

The exocyst complex is composed of 10 subunits, and its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. The study of the dynamic regulation of the evolutionarily conserved exocyst-related processes using mutants in genetically tractable organisms such as Arabidopsis thaliana is limited by the lethality or the severity of phenotypes. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 (exocyst component of 70 kDa) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and offers a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

In many species, sex is determined by a single gene, but in others, multiple genes interact to produce the sex phenotype. Here we investigate the effects of multiple interacting sex determination alleles on the secondary sexual characteristics of a species. We find that multiple alleles can produce modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics, and that the acquisition of a new sex determination allele can produce additional axes of variation for secondary sexual characteristics. These results provide context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of sex determination alleles in populations. Understanding the genetic basis of sex determination is critical for predicting the effects of environmental change on animal populations. (Show more)"

We sought to understand how iron (Fe) impacts the retina, given that retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are also challenged by accumulations of toxic lipofuscin. We found that Fe levels in RPE cells are critical for the photochemical oxidation and degradation of the toxic lipofuscin precursor A2E. These findings have implications for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in the elderly, and other retinal diseases. They also suggest that Fe may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of retinal diseases. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)."

However, the evolution of predatory specialization is often considered a dead end, as morphological and functional optimizations are expected to be lost during the evolution of separate predators. Here we show that siphonophores, a group of pelagic predators, can evolve into generalists, and that specialists on one prey type can evolve into specialists on other prey types. These findings help us understand how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs. They also provide a new perspective on the evolution of predatory morphology, and help us understand how the structure of food webs has changed over time. This work contributes to our knowledge of the evolution of predators, and to our understanding of the structure of the past and present-day ocean."

The fossil record for the evolution of the hand is fragmentary, however, and there is a gap in the fossil record between 800,000 and 1.8 My old. This gap is well documented for the emergence and subsequent proliferation of Acheulian technology. Here we report the first unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key derived feature of the human hand, the third metacarpal styloid process, in a Middle Pleistocene hominin from East Africa. This fossil thus provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key shared derived characteristic of modern human and Neandertal hand morphology and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato.

SHMT is up-regulated in cancer, and the mitochondrial isozyme is strongly up-regulated in cancer. Here we show that dual SHMT1/2 knockout blocks HCT-116 colon cancer tumor xenograft formation. We identify small-molecule dual inhibitors of human SHMT1/2, and show that formate generally rescues cells from SHMT inhibition, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We show that this effect is rooted in defective glycine import in DLBCL cell lines, rendering them uniquely dependent upon SHMT enzymatic activity to meet glycine demand. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of DLBCL. This work identifies a metabolic vulnerability of cancer cells that can be exploited for cancer therapy. It also provides a rationale for the use of formate as a therapeutic. Formate is a metabolic waste product that can be used to inhibit SHMT. We show that this strategy is effective in cancer cells, and that formate can be used to rescue cells from SHMT inhibition in DLBCL. Thus"

The results also show that forest fragmentation can increase fruit and vegetable consumption and thus vitamin A intake. The findings have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. This study also highlights the importance of using a modeling approach that combines two-way fixed-effects regression analysis with covariate balancing generalized propensity score (CBGPS) weighting to make causal inferences.

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the largest sauropods had the highest compaction susceptibility. Our"
