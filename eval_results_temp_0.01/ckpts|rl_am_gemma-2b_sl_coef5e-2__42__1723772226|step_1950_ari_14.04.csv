Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we present the first genome assemblies for two myxozoans and compare them to the genome of a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. These results have implications for understanding the origin of parasitism and the evolution of the animal kingdom. (Show more)"

In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the antiviral action of IFN and may lead to the development of new antiviral strategies. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. Sperm cells are quiescent in the male reproductive system due to Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1 channels, but become active once introduced into the low-Zn2+-concentration environment of the female reproductive tract. How Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development"

We show that DNA metabarcoding can be used to quantify diet composition at a species level, and that this approach can be used to reveal that the degree of diet overlap between species is strongly related to the degree of dietary similarity. These results suggest that the current understanding of niche partitioning among large herbivores may be incomplete, and that the coexistence of species in savanna ecosystems may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This may have important implications for the management of large herbivore populations."

This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered.

The development of new antibiotics is a major challenge, and computational approaches are essential tools to this end. In this study, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. The results of this study provide a proof of concept for the rational design of new antibiotics. This approach can be extended to other antibiotic classes and to other targets of interest. The application of this strategy will help to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens and to address the global threat of antibiotic resistance.

We used a grid-based approach to sample the genomic diversity across the island, and we found that the Malagasy population is a mixture of Bantu and Austronesian ancestries. However, the distribution of these ancestries across the island shows that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, we found that a few centuries are sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. This study provides a comprehensive view of the human history of Madagascar. It will be of interest to researchers in a wide range of disciplines, including anthropology, archaeology, and ecology. It will also be of interest to the general public, as Madagascar is a popular tourist destination."

The parasite, Plasmodium, uses a variety of mechanisms to invade the red blood cell (RBC) and cause disease. Here, we show that the malaria parasite alters the RBC surface, increasing the tension of the cytoskeleton and reducing the bending rigidity of the membrane. These changes are required for invasion and are likely to be a general feature of invasion. This finding would suggest that invasion is a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces, and that the parasite is priming the RBC surface to facilitate invasion. This is a major change in our understanding of malaria parasite invasion. (Show more)"

However, the impact of humidity on host defense and disease outcome is unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low humidity increases susceptibility to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

The auditory organs of these animals are extremely diverse in anatomy after hundreds of millions of years of evolution, yet they are all made up of cellular tissue and are morphologically part of the bodies of animals. Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. We find that the wispy, wheel-shaped orb web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to capture the sound-induced air particle movements that approach the maximum physical efficiency better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By sensing the motion of web threads, the spider remotely detects and localizes the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave, such as those emitted by approaching prey or predators. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself.

We show that a phaseout of fossil fuels can avoid an excess mortality rate of 3.61 million per year from outdoor air pollution worldwide. This could be up to 5.55 million per year by additionally controlling nonfossil anthropogenic sources. Globally, fossil-fuel-related emissions account for about 65% of the excess mortality, and 70% of the aerosol cooling. The chemical influence of air pollution on dust contributes to the aerosol cooling. Since aerosols mask the anthropogenic rise in global temperature, removing pollution particles liberates 0.51 °C and all particles 0.73 °C warming, reaching around 2 °C over North America and Northeast Asia. We conclude that a rapid phaseout of fossil fuels and major reductions of other anthropogenic sources are needed to save millions of lives, restore aerosol-perturbed rainfall patterns, and limit global warming to 2 °C."

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, HM predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. HM was associated with less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors. The findings highlight the importance of psychological examinations of masculinity as a cultural ideology to understand how men’s and women’s endorsement of HM legitimizes patriarchal dominance and reinforces gender, race, and class-based hierarchies.

In the RNA world, before the evolution of proteins, genetic information was stored in RNA molecules. In vitro evolution of an RNA polymerase ribozyme has led to the creation of a powerful tool for the reconstruction of RNA-based life. The improved polymerase can synthesize a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and, in low yield, even tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins.

The carbon cycle reorganization that preceded the extinction is punctuated by a sharp negative spike in the isotopic composition of carbonate carbon. The carbon cycle volatility persisted for ∼500 ka before a return to near preextinction values. The age model will allow a refined evaluation of the relative roles of rate-dependent processes contributing to the extinction, allowing insight into postextinction ecosystem expansion.

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete. These findings provide insight into the regulation of carbon utilization in bacteria. They also demonstrate that the translation and base-pairing functions compete, and that the two functions are not mutually exclusive. This"

We also found that ASK1 in microglia plays a major role in generating and maintaining disease. Activated astrocytes produce key inflammatory mediators, including CCL2, that further activated and recruited microglia/macrophages, in an astrocytic ASK1-dependent manner. Astrocyte-specific analysis revealed CCL2 expression was higher in the later stage compared with the early stage, suggesting a greater proinflammatory role of astrocytes in the later stage.

These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting.

We found that the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion. For the N3-EtdT lesion that disrupts base pairing, multiple transcriptional lesion bypass routes were found. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop).

The timing of this event is controversial, with some studies placing it earlier than 18 ka, the age of the oldest ice core. Here we show that a volcanic eruption series, which we identify as the Mount Takahe eruptions, occurred at the start of deglaciation and plausibly led to stratospheric ozone depletion, which in turn caused a change in the location of the Southern Hemisphere westerlies and the onset of accelerated deglaciation. This study provides a new perspective on the timing of the start of deglaciation and the role of stratospheric ozone depletion in triggering the climate changes that led to it. View Full-Text"

We provide a global map of riverine fisheries, which reveals that 90% of global catch comes from river basins with above-average stress levels. Our analysis also shows that freshwater fisheries provide the equivalent of all dietary animal protein for 158 million people, and that poor and undernourished populations are particularly reliant on inland fisheries compared with marine or aquaculture sources. Our data can be used to identify regions where freshwater fisheries are most important for food security, and to prioritize conservation efforts to protect both biodiversity and the livelihoods of local communities."

But how do we know when two people are connected? We asked pairs of friends and strangers to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners.

The exocytosis process is regulated by a series of proteins, and the dysfunction of the exocytosis process is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. In this study, we discovered a small molecule that inhibits the exocytosis process in both plant and human cells and enhances plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

In this study, we investigate the effects of multiple interacting sex determination alleles on secondary sexual characteristics in a species with polygenic sex determination. We find that the modularity of secondary sexual characteristics produced by polygenic sex determination provides context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations. Our results suggest that the modularity of secondary sexual characteristics may be a general feature of polygenic sex determination."

One is the photochemical oxidation of the pigment rhodopsin, which leads to the formation of the toxic chromophore, retinal, and the formation of the antioxidant, all-trans-retinal. The other is the oxidation of the bisretinoids, which are antioxidants that are formed as a result of the photochemical oxidation of vitamin A aldehyde adducts. We show that the redox state of the retina is influenced by the intracellular redox state of the cells, and that the redox state of the retina is influenced by the redox state of the cells."

However, the evolution of specialization is often considered a dead end, as it is associated with the evolution of morphological and functional optimizations throughout the organism. Here we show that this is not the case in siphonophores, a group of pelagic cnidarians that use their tentacles exclusively for prey capture. We show that siphonophore specialization is linked to the evolution of morphological and functional changes in the tentacles, and that these changes are linked to the evolution of prey type. Our findings contribute to understanding the evolution of specialization and morphological diversification in predators, and the role of morphological evolution in shaping present-day food webs."

We have also identified a metabolic deficiency of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which is uniquely dependent upon the addition of the one-carbon unit to serine.

However, the increase in vehicle weight has also led to the propagation of compaction into deeper soil layers, which may have negative effects on soil ecological functioning. We show that the increase in mechanization has led to a global increase in subsoil compaction risk, with the total area of compaction risk now exceeding 20% of arable land. This alarming trend calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a second paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants.
