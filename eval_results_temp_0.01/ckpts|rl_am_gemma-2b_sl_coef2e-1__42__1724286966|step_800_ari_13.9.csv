The structure of hydrate with neon is also different from that with hydrogen sulfide, which is the guest molecule with the highest electronegativity. The structure of hydrate with neon is the first example of hydrate with a guest molecule that is a noble gas.

The evolutionary origin of this group has been elusive, and a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species and a cnidarian species. Our results show that the myxozoan body plan is reduced to the essential elements required for parasitism. This reduction is accompanied by a reduction in genome size and gene content. These findings provide insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We found that SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

We find that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields will increase to values much larger than present-day values, and the probability of simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year will increase substantially. These results highlight the need for urgent investments in breeding for heat tolerance."

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa in herbivore feces. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammal species in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammal assemblages, and that diversity of large mammals may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results also highlight the importance of diet composition in understanding the role of large mammals in ecosystems. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

A Threonine to Alanine substitution at this position was studied in three representative members of the K+-channel family. Interestingly, all of the mutant channels exhibited lack of C-type inactivation gating and an inversion of their allosteric coupling (i.e., closing of the activation gate collapses the channel’s selectivity filter). A state-dependent crystallographic study of KcsA-T75A proves that, on activation, the selectivity filter transitions from a nonconductive and deep C-type inactivated conformation to a conductive one.

A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals.

The development of new therapeutic strategies is urgently needed. In this study, we found that the activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis protects cancer cells from ferroptosis, a form of regulated necrosis driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. This resistance is mediated by the induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. Furthermore, we demonstrated that SREBP1-mediated ferroptosis resistance can be overcome by mTORC1 inhibition, and that this combination therapy is effective in preclinical models of cancer.

The major drugs for treating hypertension are L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs). However, the mechanisms of LCCBs action on Ca2+ signaling and vascular remodeling are not known. Here, we show that LCCBs activate STIM/ORAI-mediated Ca2+ entry in vascular smooth muscle cells. LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. Our findings unravel a mechanism of LCCBs action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI.

We used &gt;25 years of bird surveys to test whether the NWFP’s policy of reducing clearcutting and increasing old-growth habitat improved bird populations. We found that the NWFP’s policy of reducing clearcutting and increasing old-growth habitat improved bird populations. However, the NWFP’s policy of reducing clearcutting did not reverse declines of older-forest–associated bird populations. Instead, declines accelerated, partly because of losses of older forests due to fire on federal land and continued clearcutting elsewhere. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure. Our results also highlight the importance of monitoring bird populations and the need for adaptive management to ensure that policies improve biodiversity. This study provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the influence of policy. Our findings have implications for the conservation and development of forests worldwide."

We used a comprehensive dataset of 89 genes to estimate the timing and rates of beetle diversification, and a dataset of 154 genomes or transcriptomes to trace the evolution of genes enabling symbiont-independent digestion of plant cell walls. Phylogenomic analyses of these uniquely comprehensive datasets resolved controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, corresponding (Jurassic) diversification rate increases suggest that these novel genes triggered adaptive radiations that resulted in nearly half of all living beetle species. We propose that these novel genes enabled efficient digestion of plant tissues, including lignocellulose in cell walls, facilitating the evolution of uniquely specialized plant-feeding habits, such as leaf mining and stem and wood boring. Beetle diversity thus appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding plant cell wall-degrading enzymes.

However, the evolution of brain information-processing capacity is less understood. Here, we show that the evolution of brain capacity is not driven by brain size but by the number of neurons. We show that reptiles have not only small brains relative to body size but also low neuronal densities, resulting in average neuron numbers over 20 times lower than those in birds and mammals of similar body size. This has important implications for studies using relative brain size as a proxy when looking for evolutionary drivers of animal cognition."

However, current inhibitors of TRAP1 cannot distinguish between TRAP1 and HSP90, the target of many currently available drugs. We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. Thus, the development of TRAP1-specific inhibitors may have important implications for cancer therapy. (Read more)"

It does so by binding to the barbed end of actin filaments and severing them. However, how it does so in a physiological context, where filaments are interconnected and under mechanical stress, remains unclear. Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to study the action of ADF in different mechanical situations. We find that local curvature favors severing, while tension surprisingly has no effect on ADF binding and weakly enhances severing. We also find that filament segments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist, experience a mechanical torque upon ADF binding. We propose that this ADF-induced torque dramatically enhances severing. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells.

The settlement history of Madagascar is complex, with a recent demographic growth and a sex-biased and geographically heterogeneous admixture. These results suggest that Madagascar was settled by multiple independent waves of people, rather than by a single population that was already admixed.

We find that the aquatic lifestyle is driving the evolution of larger body size in three of four extant aquatic mammal clades. The aquatic lifestyle is also driving the evolution of larger body size in the extinct ancestors of the four extant aquatic mammal clades. These results are consistent with the aquatic lifestyle driving the evolution of larger body size by constraining the evolution of mammals toward a size optimum in the aquatic realm. This size optimum occurs at an intermediate body size where thermoregulatory costs are low but feeding efficiency remains high. This study provides a quantitative test of the energetic constraints on the evolution of mammalian body size.

The unconventional manner in which RppH recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress.

We here present thermostability measurements of ancestral enzymes derived from light-requiring prokaryotic and eukaryotic phototrophs having widely separated fossil-based divergence ages. The ancestral environmental temperatures thereby determined for these photic-zone organisms––shown in modern taxa to correlate strongly with NDK thermostability––are inferred to reflect ancient surface-environment paleotemperatures. Our results suggest that Earth's surface temperature decreased over geological time from ∼65–80 °C in the Archean, a finding consistent both with previous isotope-based and protein reconstruction-based interpretations.

While low humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

We also identify this alkaloid in the red nectar of the hummingbird-visited Jaltomata herrerae. We demonstrate that nesocodin is attractive to the vertebrate pollinator Phelsuma geckos. Our findings suggest that the red color of nectar is a convergent trait that is likely to be favored by natural selection. This work provides a better understanding of the evolution of this important trait. It also has implications for the study of convergent evolution."

We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4.

We found that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion.

Here, we generate intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific RORα-deficient (RORαΔIEC) mice and find that RORα is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis by attenuating nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcriptional activity. RORαΔIEC mice exhibit excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis reveals corecruitment of RORα and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) on NF-κB target promoters and subsequent dismissal of CREB binding protein (CBP) and bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) for transcriptional repression. Together, we demonstrate that RORα/HDAC3-mediated attenuation of NF-κB signaling controls the balance of inflammatory responses, and therapeutic strategies targeting this epigenetic regulation could be beneficial to"

We find that the bacterium was repeatedly introduced into Europe from Asia, with a delay of 15 ± 1 y. This finding challenges the assumption of a single introduction of the bacterium into Europe and suggests that the pandemic was the consequence of multiple introductions of the bacterium into Europe.

Despite advances in therapy, the prognosis of AML remains poor, and there is an urgent need for novel and more efficient therapies. We show here that monoclonal antibodies targeting the IL1RAP (IL1R3) receptor are effective in treating AML in mice. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This approach may be applicable to other forms of leukemia.

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

We present a model of the trajectory of plastid genome evolution during the transition from autotrophy to a parasitic lifestyle. We show that the loss of photosynthesis is linked to the establishment of a parasitic lifestyle, characterized by the parasite’s dependence on a host to fulfill its life cycle. Our findings suggest that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner. During the functional reduction process, the elevation of evolutionary rates reaches several new rate equilibria, possibly relating to the modified protein turnover rates in heterotrophic plastids. This model can be applied to other transitions from autotrophy to a parasitic lifestyle. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

A diiron cyclase is required in Rvi. gelatinosus, whereas alphaproteobacterial cyclases require a newly discovered protein, encoded by a gene conserved in these organisms. These data delineate three classes of diiron cyclase in chlorophototrophic organisms from higher plants to bacteria, and their evolution"

Neuroinflammation is a complex process involving multiple signaling pathways, and the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1 (ASK1) in neuroinflammation is unknown. In this study, we generated conditional knockout (CKO) mice that lack ASK1 in T cells, dendritic cells, microglia/macrophages, microglia, or astrocytes, to assess the roles of ASK1 during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We found that ASK1 deficiency in microglia/macrophages or astrocytes reduced neuroinflammation in the later stage of EAE, whereas ASK1 deficiency in T cells or dendritic cells had no significant effects on EAE severity. ASK1 signaling in microglia/macrophages played a major role in generating and maintaining disease. Activated astrocytes produce key inflammatory mediators, including CCL2, that further activated and recruited microglia/macrophages, in an astrocytic ASK1-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that glial ASK1 is a promising therapeutic target for reducing neuroinflammation. This study provides a better understanding of the role of ASK1 in neuroinflammation and"

The drought began in 2012 and now includes the lowest calendar-year and 12-mo precipitation, the highest annual temperature, and the most extreme drought indicators on record. The extremely warm and dry conditions have led to acute water shortages, groundwater overdraft, critically low streamflow, and enhanced wildfire risk. We find that precipitation deficits that occurred when conditions were warm were more than twice as likely to yield drought years. We also find that although there has not been a substantial change in the probability of either negative or moderately negative precipitation anomalies in recent decades, the occurrence of drought years has been greater in the past two decades than in the preceding century. Finally, we conclude that anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of co-occurring warm–dry conditions like those that have created the acute human and ecosystem impacts associated with the “exceptional” 2012–2014 drought in California."

The etiology of autism is so complicated because it involves the effects of variants of several hundred risk genes along with the contribution of environmental factors. Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. As an alternative approach, extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying the convergence of the targets and functions of the autism-risk genes to facilitate mapping out causal paths. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that behavioral inflexibility resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral phenotypes of autism-risk genes and their convergent functions. It also provides a strategy for identifying the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms."

Here we use a fluorescently tagged polyglutamine-expanded form of human huntingtin to monitor the spread of aggregates in the Drosophila brain. We show that aggregates accumulate at synaptic terminals and progressively spread throughout the brain. These aggregates are internalized and accumulate within other neurons. We demonstrate that the release of aggregates requires N-ethylmalemide–sensitive fusion protein 1, indicating that active release and uptake of aggregates are important elements of spreading and disease progression. These results provide a model for the spread of protein aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases and suggest that the inhibition of active release and/or the promotion of uptake may be a useful therapeutic strategy.

We also identify a small-molecule dual inhibitor of SHMT1 and SHMT2. This inhibitor is effective in cancer cells, but paradoxically increases cytotoxicity in a cancer cell-line screen. We show that this effect is rooted in defective glycine import in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), a cancer cell-line dependent disease. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of DLBCL. This work provides a rationale for targeting SHMT in cancer, and for targeting glycine import in DLBCL.

To explain the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in ALS, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into endosomes. Uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus trop"

This scenario is supported by a unique set of paleoclimate proxies, including a volcanic eruption record in ice cores, and is consistent with the observed changes in Southern Hemisphere climate. The Mount Takahe eruptions are the most distant volcanic eruptions known to have caused a climate change. This study provides a new perspective on the causes of accelerated deglaciation.

This discovery has important implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms that control the adult nervous system’s intrinsic regenerative capacity. Moreover, our study suggests that the ability to regenerate after injury is not a property of a single pathway, but rather a property of a broad class of pathways that are activated by sensory activity and/or elevated cAMP."

Here, we used metabolic PET, which maps nonfluctuating signals related to total activity, to identify and validate reproducible RSN topographies in healthy and disease populations. In healthy subjects, the dominant (first component) metabolic RSN was topographically similar to the default mode network (DMN). In contrast, in Parkinson’s disease (PD), this RSN was subordinated to an independent disease-related pattern. Network functionality was assessed by quantifying metabolic RSN expression in cerebral blood flow PET scans acquired at rest and during task performance. The dominant RSN was deactivated during task performance, and this abnormality was partially corrected by dopaminergic therapy. Time-course comparisons of DMN loss in longitudinal resting metabolic scans from PD and Alzheimer’s disease subjects illustrated that significant reductions appeared later for PD, in parallel with the development of cognitive dysfunction. In contrast, in Alzheimer’s disease significant reductions in network expression were already present at diagnosis, progressing over time.

We found that DNA-me differences at certain loci persist for several years during the follow-up of people with diabetes. These loci are associated with glycemia and may contribute to the epigenetic explanation for metabolic memory. These findings support the use of DNA-me profiling as a biomarker for the prediction of metabolic memory.

However, the role of FSIP1 in the progression and drug sensitivity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

These results suggest the existence of a gut–brain axis in alcohol dependence, which implicates the gut microbiota as an actor in the gut barrier and in behavioral disorders. Thus, the gut microbiota seems to be a previously unidentified target in the management of alcohol dependence.

However, these factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. Our findings have important implications for the design of conservation and restoration strategies. They also highlight the need to consider the potential for synergistic effects of biodiversity loss and environmental warming on ecosystem functioning.

We show that FTs can function as an important interplant flowering signal in host–dodder interactions. The unique means of flowering regulation of dodder illustrates how regressive evolution, commonly found in parasites, may facilitate the physiological synchronization of parasite and host, here allowing the C. australis parasite to time reproduction exactly with that of their hosts, likely optimizing parasite fitness.

We found that the speed at which people responded to each other was a robust predictor of felt connection. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

However, the mechanisms underlying the integration of these signals are not fully understood. Here, we report that stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is expressed in SANCs and plays a critical role in the integration of membrane and store-operated Ca2+ signals. These findings reveal that STIM1 is a multifunctional regulator of Ca2+ dynamics in SANCs that links SR Ca2+ store content with electrical events occurring in the plasma membrane, thereby contributing to automaticity of the SAN.

The cause of this warming is still under debate. Here, we present a case study of an abrupt global warming event that occurred ∼304 Ma during a glacial period. We show that this event was caused by a rapid release of organic matter–derived carbon (C) and that the warming was linked to an increase in nutrient fluxes and anoxia. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms of rapid global warming and the potential for future climate change. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

We show that RSPO certification is associated with reduced deforestation in oil palm plantations. However, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results suggest that certification is not yet delivering on its promise to reduce deforestation."

In humans, its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. The exocyst complex is evolutionarily conserved in plants, and its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. However, the study of the dynamic regulation of the exocyst-related processes in plants is limited by the lethality or the severity of phenotypes. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 (exocyst component of 70 kDa) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and offers a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. This study also offers a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (PsycINFO Database Record"

In many species, sex is determined by a single locus, but in others, multiple loci interact to produce the sex phenotype. Here we investigate the effects of multiple interacting sex determination alleles in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii. We find that multiple alleles of a single locus can produce a modular system of sex-linked traits, including genital morphology, craniofacial morphology, gastrointestinal morphology, and home tank behaviors. These results provide context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of the maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations. The modularity of secondary sexual characteristics produced by multiple interacting sex determination alleles provides a framework for understanding the evolutionary consequences of sex determination alleles in populations.

These species are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration. We show that the intracellular levels of iron, which are known to regulate redox activity, impact the degradation of bisretinoids. These findings have implications for the development of strategies to reduce the oxidative damage caused by bisretinoids. This is particularly important given the high levels of iron in the retina and the importance of iron in the degradation of bisretinoids. The results also suggest that the degradation of bisretinoids may be a target for therapeutic intervention. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Here we show that siphonophores, a group of pelagic cnidarians, are an exception to this rule. We show that siphonophores can evolve from generalists to specialists on different prey types, and that specialists on one prey type have evolved into specialists on other prey types. These findings help us understand how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs. They also provide a new perspective on the evolution of predatory niche diversification."

The fossil record for the hominin hand between 800,000 and 1.8 My old is sparse, and the origin of the distinctive human hand morphology is poorly understood. Here we report the discovery of a hominin hand from 1.42 My old in Kenya. This fossil provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key shared derived characteristic of modern human and Neandertal hand morphology. This suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato. This finding also suggests that the evolution of the human hand was more complex than previously thought. The implications of this finding for the evolution of the human hand are discussed.

One-carbon units support cell growth, and thus are critical for cancer. We show that dual knockout of SHMT1 and SHMT2 in cancer cells blocks tumor growth. We also identify a small-molecule inhibitor of SHMT1/2, which is effective in cancer cells and in a cancer cell-line screen. However, one-carbon donor formate is a potent inhibitor of SHMT, and paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We show that formate is a potent inhibitor of SHMT2, and that formate inhibition is defective in SHMT2-deficient cells. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of DLBCL. These findings suggest that SHMT inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer, and that formate-based inhibitors are a promising lead for drug development.

This study shows that deforestation in rural Tanzania led to a reduction in people’s fruit and vegetable consumption and thus vitamin A adequacy of diets. Conversely, forest fragmentation led to an increase in fruit and vegetable consumption and dietary vitamin A adequacy. These findings have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. This study also highlights the importance of using causal inference methods to test the effects of deforestation on people’s diets. This is a relatively new approach in the field of nutrition and environmental research."

The use of farm machinery has greatly increased the capacity of agricultural production, but it has also increased the weight of vehicles, which has led to the propagation of subsoil compaction into deeper soil layers. We show that the risk of subsoil compaction has increased over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity. This alarming trend calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the discovery of a 130-million-year-old footprint of a sauropod in the subsurface of a farm field. This discovery suggests that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This study highlights the need for a"
