To understand the extreme reduction in genome size and gene content that is characteristic of the parasitic Myxozoa, we compared the genomes of two myxozoans to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results show that the myxozoan genome is one of the smallest reported in animals, and that the parasite has lost many genes involved in development and cell–cell communication. These findings suggest that the parasitic lifestyle was accompanied by a dramatic reduction in genome size and gene content. Our results also suggest that the transition from a free-living to a parasitic lifestyle was accompanied by a reduction in the complexity of the body plan. These findings have implications for understanding the evolution of parasitism and the origin of the parasitic lifestyle. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1, but the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. Here, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

Here we show that anxiety, a personality trait, directly influences social dominance in male outbred rats and identify an important mediating role for mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens. High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter exhibit reduced mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals. We conclude that mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens is crucial for social hierarchy establishment and is critically involved in the low social competitiveness associated with high anxiety. Our findings highlight a key role for brain energy metabolism in social behavior and point to mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens as a potential marker and avenue of treatment for anxiety-related social disorders."

We found that cancer cells with mutations in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, which are highly prevalent in human cancer, are resistant to ferroptosis. This resistance is mediated by a lipogenesis program driven by sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and monounsaturated fatty acids, which are central regulators of lipid metabolism. These findings suggest that ferroptosis can be exploited as a therapeutic strategy for cancer, and that combination of ferroptosis induction with mTORC1 inhibition may be a promising approach for cancer therapy.

Our findings highlight the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure. We also show that the NWFP has not yet been successful in reversing the long-term declines of older-forest–associated bird populations. This is a major challenge for the policy, and we discuss the need for continued monitoring and adaptive management. Our findings are important for the design of other policy instruments for the conservation of biodiversity."

This problem can be addressed by the development of new antibacterial agents to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. In this study, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. The design strategy presented here is a promising approach for the development of new antibiotics. (Show more)"

Popular network architectures often add additional operations and connections to the standard architecture to enable training deeper networks. To achieve accurate results in practice, a large number of trainable parameters are often required. Here, we introduce a network architecture based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data. The proposed architecture is easier to implement, train, and apply in practice, and automatically adapts to different problems. We believe that the proposed architecture will be useful for many problems in computer vision and image processing. The code is available at this https URL .

We used a grid-based approach to sample the genomic diversity across the island, which allowed us to study the history of the island in a new way. We find that Madagascar is a mosaic of genetic contributions from Africa and Asia, with a recent settlement of Madagascar. However, the distribution of the genetic contributions across the island shows that the settlement was not homogeneous, suggesting that the settlement of Madagascar was not a single event. Finally, we show that a few centuries are sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. This study provides a new perspective on the history of Madagascar. It also provides a tool to study the history of other islands in the Indian Ocean. (Show more)"

The majority of the chicken bones belong to adult individuals, and the observed 2:1 ratio of female to male bones is consistent with the assumption that the species was exploited for meat. The results are supported further by an extensive survey of chicken remains from 234 sites in the Southern Levant, spanning more than three millennia. We argue that the gradual acclimatization of chickens in the Southern Levant and its gradual integration into the local economy, the latter fully accomplished in the Hellenistic period, was a crucial step in the adoption of this species in European husbandry some 100 y later.

In bacteria, they function as precursors to nucleoside tetraphosphate (Np4) RNA caps, which are required for rapid degradation of the capped transcripts. In Escherichia coli, the predominant Np4 decapping enzyme is inactivated by the very conditions of disulfide stress that enable Np4-capped RNAs to accumulate to high levels. Here, we show that a second enzyme, RppH, is activated by disulfide stress and assumes a leading role in decapping those transcripts. Unexpectedly, RppH recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5′ termini, resulting in a one-nucleotide shift in substrate specificity. The unconventional manner in which RppH recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress.

The observations provide substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI process. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI. This instrument is expected to become a significant contributor to the ACI investigations. This is a significant contribution to the field."

They open and close their pore gates to allow or block ion flow. K+ channels commonly possess two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that BK channels can exhibit slow C-type inactivation/recovery and that the extents and rates of C-type inactivation/recovery inversely correlate with channel-open probability. We propose that the BK channel’s closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. This study provides a new perspective on the relationship between activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery in K+ channels. It also provides a possible mechanism for the BK channel’s normal closing. (Show more)"

We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

The process is complex and requires the cooperation of many proteins. One of the most important proteins is proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which is involved in many processes, including DNA replication. In this study, we investigated the interaction between the lagging strand DNA polymerase δ and PCNA. We found that the interaction between the two proteins is not stable, which is important for the activity of the polymerase. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanism of lagging strand DNA replication. It also provides a basis for the development of new drugs that can be used to treat cancer.

However, the analysis of text data is challenging because of the large number of documents and the diversity of topics. We introduce a method to identify latent patterns in text data and represent documents as topic sequences. Our method is based on advances in machine learning and can be applied to a wide range of text data. We illustrate our method with a prominent example of underutilized text: the US National Violent Death Reporting System. Our results provide a detailed quantitative picture of reporting about lethal violence and its gendered nature. Our method offers a flexible and broadly applicable approach to model topics in text data. We believe that our method will be useful to researchers in many fields."

This epidemic marked the start of the second plague pandemic, which lasted in Europe until the early 19th century. This pandemic is generally understood as the consequence of a singular introduction of Yersinia pestis, after which the disease established itself in European rodents over four centuries. To locate these putative plague reservoirs, we studied the climate fluctuations that preceded regional plague epidemics, based on a dataset of 7,711 georeferenced historical plague outbreaks and 15 annually resolved tree-ring records from Europe and Asia. We provide evidence for repeated climate-driven reintroductions of the bacterium into European harbors from reservoirs in Asia, with a delay of 15 ± 1 y. Our analysis finds no support for the existence of permanent plague reservoirs in medieval Europe. This study provides a new perspective on the history of the Black Death and the spread of plague in Europe. It also has implications for the spread of other diseases in the past and in the future.

We show that the disease is caused by a virus and that the virus is transmitted vertically from parent to offspring.

There is an urgent need for novel and more efficient therapies, ideally targeting AML stem cells that are essential for maintaining the disease. Here, we show that monoclonal antibodies targeting the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The protein also interferes with the ability of the RNA to repress carbon utilization genes. These results demonstrate that the protein and RNA compete for the same binding sites on the target gene.

These mutations lead to the formation of intracellular inclusions that contain a large number of proteins that do not share obvious characteristics. Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions in ALS are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. Rather, we observe that the inclusion bodies in ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. Our results suggest that the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in ALS is a general feature of the disease. This finding may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for ALS. (Show more)"

In the United States, the economic and ecological costs of wildfire have risen substantially in recent decades. Although climate change has likely enabled a portion of the increase in wildfire activity, the direct role of people in increasing wildfire activity has been largely overlooked. We show that humans have vastly expanded the spatial and seasonal “fire niche” in the United States, accounting for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. Actions to raise awareness and increase management in regions prone to human-started wildfires should be a focus of United States policy to reduce fire risk and associated hazards."

In this paper, we introduce a computer vision method to measure changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods from time-series street-level imagery. We connect changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods with economic and demographic data and find that three factors predict neighborhood improvement: the density of college-educated adults, the initial appearance of the neighborhood, and the proximity of the neighborhood to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities. Our method can be used to study the physical dynamics of cities in the future."

We show that the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis is driven by altered nutrient cycling during heat stress. This shift from nutrient uptake to release is a direct consequence of the metabolic energy demand of the coral host and the resulting amino acid degradation. The resulting shift from symbiont to host carbon translocation is a key factor in the early stages of bleaching.

Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

As a result, many major corporations and countries have made commitments to purchase or produce only “sustainable” palm oil. Certification is the tool most used to fulfill these procurement policies, and around 20% of global palm oil production was certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) in 2017. However, the effect of certification on deforestation in oil palm plantations remains unclear. Here, we show that certification is associated with reduced deforestation in oil palm plantations. Nevertheless, most plantations contained little residual forest when they received certification. As a result, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation.

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. This alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the discovery of a new species of sauropod in the Cretaceous of Argentina with a fixed foraging trail. This discovery provides a link between the Cretaceous and the modern era of mechan"
