Here, we present a comparative analysis of the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species and a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to block nuclear import of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are essential for induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We found that SARS-CoV-2 uses a viral accessory protein, Orf6, to block nuclear import of the transcription factors. We show that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1, a protein complex that mediates nuclear import of cargo proteins. We also show that a simple mutation in Orf6 abolishes its ability to block nuclear import of STAT1 and STAT2. Our findings provide a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.

These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

Our results indicate that LMH partition food resources, even among species that are similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.

Our observations of the size distribution of floating plastic debris point at important size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered.

We found that high-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low-anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as decreased ATP and increased ROS production in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious individuals.

LCCBs are widely used in clinical practice, but the mechanisms of their action on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are not fully understood. Here, we show that LCCBs activate the STIM/ORAI Ca2+ sensor system in VSMCs, which is a key regulator of vascular remodeling. Our findings provide a rationale for the use of LCCBs in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. However, our data also suggest that LCCBs may be harmful in patients with advanced age or cardiovascular disease, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated."

We found that the two organisms are very similar, and that the genome of M. lepromatosis, a leprosy pathogen that is rarely found in endemic areas, is more similar to that of M. leprae than to that of M. leprae. This suggests that M. lepromatosis is more closely related to the ancestral form of the pathogen and may be neuropathogenic.

Some studies suggest that TRAP1 is a tumor suppressor, whereas others suggest that it is an oncogene. We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This study provides a mechanistic explanation for the controversial role of TRAP1 in cancer. It also suggests that TRAP1 may be a promising target for cancer therapy. (PsycINFO Database Record"

However, how ADF/cofilins are able to disassemble actin filaments in a physiological context, where filaments are interconnected and under mechanical stress, remains unclear. Here, we show that ADF/cofilins are able to enhance the severing of filaments by a mechanism that is based on the filament’s mechanical state. We propose that this mechanism is critical to boost ADF/cofilins’ ability to disassemble highly connected filament networks in cells.

This study shows that the evolution of an aquatic lifestyle is driving three of the four extant aquatic mammal clades toward a size attractor at ∼500 kg. The existence of this body size attractor and the relatively rapid selection toward, and limited deviation from, this attractor rule out most hypothesized drivers of size increase. These three independent body size increases and a shared aquatic optimum size are consistent with control by differences in the scaling of energetic intake and cost functions with body size between the terrestrial and aquatic realms. Under this energetic model, thermoregulatory costs constrain minimum size, whereas limitations on feeding efficiency constrain maximum size. Rather than being released from size pressures, water-dwelling mammals are driven and confined to larger body sizes by the strict energetic demands of the aquatic medium."

However, the extent to which the female contributes to the male’s reproductive output is largely unknown. Here, we show that the proteome of Drosophila sperm undergoes substantial changes after being transferred to the female reproductive tract. We also show that the female contributes to the male’s reproductive output by providing proteins that support sperm viability during the prolonged period between mating and fertilization. Our research provides a comprehensive characterization of the posttesticular life history of the sperm proteome and expands our understanding of the critical process of sperm–FRT interactions. This work provides a foundation for future studies that will elucidate the extent to which the female contributes to the male’s reproductive output and the extent to which the male contributes to the female’s reproductive output.

The binding reaction is triggered, in part, by alterations in flow during bleeding. We show that force application switches VWF to a second state with faster on-rate, providing a mechanism for activating VWF binding to platelets. Switching occurs near 10 pN, a force that also induces a state of the receptor−ligand complex with slower off-rate. Force greatly increases the effects of VWF mutations, explaining pathophysiology. Conversion of single molecule kon (s−1) to bulk phase kon (s−1M−1) and the kon and koff values extrapolated to zero force for the low-force pathways show remarkably good agreement with bulk-phase measurements. This suggests that the force-dependent pathway is the dominant mechanism of VWF activation. This is the first time that a force-dependent pathway has been observed in a protein. It is also the first time that a force-dependent pathway has been observed in a protein with a single ligand. This is important because it suggests that force-"

However, it is difficult to be well represented in current climate models. This is due to the complexity of the ACI process and the lack of observational capability. Here, we introduce a new technique, the dual-field-of-view high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL), to investigate the ACI process. The HSRL is capable of simultaneously profiling aerosol and cloud properties. We demonstrate the capability of the HSRL to investigate ACI processes. The results show that the aerosol loading has no discernible effect on the liquid water path but leads to increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius. This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations obtained from the HSRL constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI."

We present a method for reconstructing the temperature of ancient Earth surface environments based on the thermostability of ancestral enzymes. Our results suggest that surface temperature decreased over geological time from ∼65–80 °C in the Archean, a finding consistent both with previous isotope-based and protein reconstruction-based interpretations.

We also found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation.

We show that this interaction leads to a reduction in the energy barrier to invasion and thus a major change in the invasion process. This finding has major implications for our understanding of malaria parasite invasion and suggests that the parasite and host cell are working together to facilitate entry.

We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden.

We found that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion.

The RNA encodes a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC) that interacts with the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, GlpD, and increases dehydrogenase activity. We found that the RNA also interacts with two other metabolic enzymes, cadA and galE, and that the interaction with the carbon utilization enzymes competes with the interaction with the sRNA. The interaction with the carbon utilization enzymes is important for the growth of the bacteria in galactose medium. The interaction with the sRNA is important for the growth of the bacteria in glycerol medium.

We used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a molecular mechanism for autism and a target for drug development. It also provides a general framework for understanding the functions of other genes that are involved in the same behavioral process. (PsycINFO Database Record"

However, the mechanisms underlying this process are not fully understood. Here we show that hypoxia induces cerebral edema in rats and that this process is mediated by the hypoxic-induced release of corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) from the hypothalamus. This CRF is then taken up by the cortex and acts on the CRF receptor CRFR1 to trigger signaling of cAMP/PKA in cortical astrocytes, leading to activation of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and cerebral edema. These findings provide a molecular explanation for the pathophysiology of cerebral edema induced by hypoxia. They also suggest that CRFR1 agonists could be developed as a treatment for cerebral edema. This could be particularly important in the case of hypoxic brain injury, which is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. (PsycINFO Database Record"

It arises in the context of big data and complex statistical models. It is the challenge of assessing the strength of associations that we find in our data.

The role of the recently identified cancer antigen, fibrous sheath interacting protein 1 (FSIP1), in TNBC has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 is highly expressed in TNBC and is associated with poor prognosis. FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. (Show more)"

We show that dopamine-containing neurons in the substantia nigra form highly unusual arborizations that target bundles of ventrally extending dopamine-containing dendrites and clusters of their parent cell bodies.

Thus, these striosome–dendron bouquets likely represent subsystems with the nigro–striato–nigral loop that are affected in human disorders including Parkinson’s disease. Given evidence that striosomes receive input from cortical regions related to the control of mood and motivation and that they link functionally to reinforcement and decision-making, the striosome–dendron bouquets could be critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease. This work provides a unique view of the dopamine-containing nigral system and its relationship to the striatum.

We have developed a small-molecule inhibitor of the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), which converts serine to glycine and a folate-bound one-carbon unit. We show that this inhibitor blocks colon cancer growth in mice, and that the cancer cells are dependent upon SHMT enzymatic activity for glycine import. We also show that the cancer cells of one type of lymphoma are uniquely dependent upon SHMT enzymatic activity for glycine import. Thus, we have identified a metabolic vulnerability of cancer cells that can be exploited therapeutically. This work has implications for cancer treatment, and for the development of new metabolic inhibitors. (Simplified version)"

In response, strategies to improve food and nutrition security have been promoted, which have focused on increasing agricultural production. However, little attention has been paid to the role of natural landscapes such as forests in improving people’s diets. This study shows that deforestation can reduce people’s consumption of fruits and vegetables and thus their vitamin A intake, and that forest fragmentation can increase consumption of these foods. These findings have important implications for policy makers, who should consider the role of forests in improving people’s diets and health."

This study shows that the weight of farm machinery has increased subsoil compaction risk, with the risk of subsoil compaction now affecting 20% of arable land. We hypothesize that the roaming of sauropods, the largest land animals that walked Earth, would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm machinery, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This study highlights the need for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. It also suggests that the ecological strategies of sauropods may have been a response to the risk of subsoil compaction. (Show more)"
