However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of HTT-associated neurodegeneration are not fully understood. Here, we show that the accumulation of H1- and H3-tagged HTT-interacting proteins in the brain is a key feature of Huntington’s disease. We show that the accumulation of H1- and H3-tagged H1-interacting proteins in the brain is a key factor in the pathogenesis of Huntington’s disease. We also show that the H1-interacting protein H1-interacting protein is a key player in the pathogenesis of Huntington’s disease. Finally, we show that the H1-interacting protein H1-interacting protein is a key player in the pathogenesis of Huntington’s disease. These results reveal that the H1-interacting protein H1-interacting protein is a key player in the pathogenesis of Huntington’s disease.

The jasmonate (JA) signaling pathway is a major regulator of plant defense responses to herbivore herbivory. The jasmonate-regulated JA signaling pathway is known to promote JA biosynthesis and to induce the expression of JA-responsive genes. However, the role of the jasmonate signaling pathway in the regulation of JA-mediated defense has not been well-characterized. Here, we show that the jasmonate signaling pathway regulates the expression of the Arabidopsis thaliana gene encoding the jasmonic acid (JA) acid synthase (OsJAS4) gene. We also show that the jasmonate-regulated JA-responsive gene (OsJAS4) gene is induced by insect herbivory. We further show that the jasmonate-regulated polyphenol oxidase (OsPON) gene (OsPON1) is induced by insect herbivory. These results reveal that the jasmonate signaling pathway"
