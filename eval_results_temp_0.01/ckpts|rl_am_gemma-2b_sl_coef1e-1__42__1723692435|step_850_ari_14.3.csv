However, the structure of hydrate with guest molecules is still not well understood. In this work, we report the structure of neon hydrate at high pressure and temperature. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The resolved structure where Ne dissolved in ice II is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. The density distributions indicate that the vibration of Ne atoms is mainly in planes perpendicular to D2O channels, whereas their distributions along the channels are further constrained by interactions between adjacent Ne atoms. This work provides a new insight into the structure of hydrate with guest molecules. It also provides a new method to control the structure of hydrate. This work is expected to be of interest to researchers in the fields of geochemistry, geophysics, and materials science.

Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. To gain insight into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite, we compared the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species to the transcriptome and genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides a unique resource for understanding the evolution of the Myxozoa and the origin of parasitism. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

This will make it more difficult for countries to produce enough food for their own people and for export. The instability of global grain trade and international grain prices will increase, and the risk of food insecurity will rise.

However, the extent to which species partition food-plant species is largely unknown because of the difficulty of species-level identification with traditional methods. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammal species in semiarid African savanna. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers, and dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, dietary composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammal assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This study highlights the importance of using DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for species-level identification in future studies of large mammal diets.

Using data from the Malaspina 2010 circumnavigation, regional surveys, and previously published reports, we show a worldwide distribution of plastic on the surface of the open ocean, mostly accumulating in the convergence zones of each of the five subtropical gyres with comparable density. However, the global load of plastic on the open ocean surface was estimated to be on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This is due to the size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

The treatment of hypertension is the cornerstone of cardiovascular disease prevention. The most widely used drugs for treating hypertension are the L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs). However, the use of LCCBs is associated with the development of heart failure. Here, we show that LCCBs activate Ca2+ signaling pathways that promote vascular remodeling. Our findings indicate that LCCBs should be used with caution in patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling. This study provides a mechanism of LCCB action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrates that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI.

We show that our design strategy is successful in identifying compounds that are active against resistant pathogens and that are more active than telithromycin, the only approved acylide antibiotic. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

To achieve accurate results in practice, a large number of trainable parameters are often required. Here, we introduce a network architecture based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice, and automatically adapts to different problems. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data."

We used a comprehensive dataset of 89 genes to estimate the timing and rates of beetle diversification, and a dataset of 154 genomes or transcriptomes to trace the evolution of genes enabling symbiont-independent digestion of plant cell walls. Phylogenomic analyses resolved controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, plant cell wall-degrading enzymes obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, both major independent origins of specialized herbivory in beetles coincide with the first appearances of these genes in their genomes. We propose that these genes enabled efficient digestion of plant tissues, including lignocellulose in cell walls, facilitating the evolution of uniquely specialized plant-feeding habits, such as leaf mining and stem and wood boring. Beetle diversity thus appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbiv"

These social-learning conditions were compared with an asocial individual-learning condition in which individual participants made repeated attempts at constructing a paper plane, without having access to any planes produced by other participants. Larger populations generated greater variation in plane performance and gave participants access to better-adapted planes, but this did not enhance CCE.

Today, most human plague cases are bubonic, caused by spillover of infected fleas from rodent epizootics, or pneumonic, caused by inhalation of infectious droplets. However, little is known about the historical spread of plague in Europe during the Second Pandemic (14–19th centuries), including the Black Death, which led to high mortality and recurrent epidemics for hundreds of years. Here, we describe a compartmental model for plague transmission by a human ectoparasite vector. Using Bayesian inference, we found that this model fits mortality curves from nine outbreaks in Europe better than models for rodent or pneumonic transmission. Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346–1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats. This study provides a better understanding of the history of plague in Europe and may help to prevent future outbreaks. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

However, it is often difficult to disentangle the effects of brain size and the number of neurons on cognitive ability. This study uses the largest dataset of its kind to reconstruct the evolution of brain neuronal numbers in amniotes. We show that reptiles have not only small brains relative to body size but also low neuronal densities, resulting in average neuron numbers over 20 times lower than those in birds and mammals of similar body size. Amniote brain evolution is characterized by the following four major shifts in neuron–brain scaling. The most dramatic increases in brain neurons occurred independently with the appearance of birds and mammals, resulting in convergent neuron scaling in the two endotherm lineages. The other two major increases in the number of neurons happened in core land birds and anthropoid primates, which are two groups known for their cognitive prowess."

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal and transformed cells is more complex than previously appreciated. We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor.

They are dynamic polymers that can be assembled and disassembled. The actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin family is the main regulator of actin filament disassembly. It is a key player in many cellular processes, including cell motility, cell division, and cell death. However, how it does so in a physiological context, where filaments are interconnected and under mechanical stress, remains unclear. Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques, coupled to microfluidics, to study the action of ADF/cofilin in different mechanical situations. We find that mechanical stress has no effect on ADF/cofilin binding, but dramatically enhances severing. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. We propose that it is a general mechanism that is used by other ADF/cofilin-related proteins to sever filament networks in cells. This mechanism could be a target for the development of new drugs. This work provides a mechanistic explanation of how cells control the disassembly of actin filaments. It also provides a new approach to control the disassembly"

We found that the Malagasy population is a mixture of Bantu and Austronesian populations, with a limited contribution from Europe and the Middle East. The admixture happened recently, suggesting a rapid settlement of Madagascar during the last millennium. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the settlement was not homogeneous, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population.

This is a form of emotional contagion, which is well established in laboratory experiments. However, the results of previous experiments are controversial, and some have suggested that emotional contagion does not occur in the real world. Our results suggest that this controversy may be due to the fact that previous experiments have not considered the possibility that emotional contagion may occur outside of in-person interaction between individuals. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others’ positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.

This sensing mechanism is mediated by the type IV pilus-associated chemotaxis system, which regulates the production of cAMP and the expression of hundreds of genes, including key virulence factors. The mechanochemical model proposed here suggests that the type IV pilus-associated chemotaxis system measures the mechanical activity of the surface adhesin type IV pili, thereby promoting long-term surface attachment that can stimulate additional virulence and biofilm-inducing pathways. This study thus provides a mechanistic understanding of how bacteria sense surfaces and highlights the importance of type IV pili in bacterial surface sensing.

SOC systems are characterized by a power-law distribution of the occurrence times of events. The simplest model of SOC is the so-called sandpile model, which is a discrete-time dynamical system on a lattice. In this paper, we study a continuous version of the sandpile model, which is a certain scaling limit of the sandpile model. We describe the model and its relation to pattern formation and proportional growth phenomena. We also discuss the dichotomy between continuous and discrete models in several contexts. Our aim in this context is to present an idealized tropical toy model, requiring further investigation."

We show that the sperm proteome undergoes substantial compositional changes after being transferred to the female reproductive tract. Multiple seminal fluid proteins initially associate with sperm, but most become undetectable after sperm are stored. Female-derived proteins also begin to associate with sperm immediately after mating, and they comprise nearly 20% of the postmating sperm proteome following 4 d of storage in the female reproductive tract. Female-derived proteins that associate with sperm are enriched for processes associated with energy metabolism, suggesting that female contributions support sperm viability during the prolonged period between copulation and fertilization.

The A1 domain is conformationally sensitive, and gain-of-function mutations in A1 and glycoprotein Ibα (GPIbα) on platelets suggest conformational regulation. We show that force application switches A1 and/or GPIbα to a second state with faster on-rate, providing a mechanism for activating VWF binding to platelets. Switching occurs near 10 pN, a force that also induces a state of the receptor−ligand complex with slower off-rate. Force greatly increases the effects of VWF mutations, explaining pathophysiology. Conversion of single molecule kon (s−1) to bulk phase kon (s−1M−1) and the kon and koff values extrapolated to zero force for the low-force pathways show remarkably good agreement with bulk-phase measurements.

However, the ACI is difficult to be well represented in current climate models. This is due to the lack of high-resolution and simultaneous observations of diurnal aerosol loading and cloud microphysical properties. To overcome this conundrum, we introduce the dual-field-of-view (FOV) high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) for simultaneously profiling aerosol and water cloud properties, especially water cloud microphysical properties. This instrument, verified by the Monte Carlo simulation and coincident observations of other techniques, was used to conduct a case study over Beijing. The observations show that increased aerosol loading led to increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius, consistent with expectations. However, the aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations obtained from the dual-FOV HSRL constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI. This study provides a significant contribution to the ACI investigations.

We hypothesized that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We induced C-type inactivation in BK channels and studied the relationship between activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery.

In the temperate regions, seasonal influenza outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in ambient humidity. While low ambient humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

This merge operation is consistent with the hypothesis that the brain builds a hierarchy of nested phrases.

The ears of animals are diverse, but all are made up of cellular tissue and are morphologically part of the body. Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. We find that the spider’s web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to sense the motion of web threads, which allows the spider to remotely detect and localize the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself. The outsourcing and supersizing of auditory function in spiders provide unique features for studying extended and regenerative sensing and designing novel acoustic flow detectors for precise fluid dynamic measurement and manipulation.

Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions.

Here, we use in vitro evolution to improve the activity and generality of an RNA polymerase ribozyme, which can synthesize a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and, in low yield, even tRNA. The polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of PCR.

Together, these results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities. The results also suggest that physical improvements in neighborhoods are more likely to occur in areas with higher concentrations of college-educated adults and that the physical appearance of neighborhoods is more likely to be improved by the presence of other physically attractive neighborhoods.

Areas in which late-spring frosts used to be unlikely, such as broad-leaved forests and shrublands in Europe and Asia, instead harbor opportunistic tree species (quickly reacting to warming air temperatures). Given species’ innate resistance strategies, we estimate that ∼35% of the European and ∼26% of the Asian temperate forest area, but only ∼10% of the North American, will experience increasing late-frost damage in the future.

It remains unclear what role these subsets play in inflammatory bowel disease. Using a Th17 transfer model of colitis, we found that IFN-γ–deficient Th17 cells retained an IL-17A+ phenotype and were unable to induce colitis in recipients. Development of disease required the transition of a subset of Th17 precursors to Th1-like cells and was contingent on the expression of both Stat4 and T-bet, but not the IL-12 or IFN-γ receptors.

We demonstrate that the pathogen induces the tick to express antifreeze glycoprotein, which alters the composition of the tick microbiota and the integrity of the peritrophic matrix, a barrier that protects the gut from infection. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms by which pathogens influence the microbiota of their vectors. (Show more)"

However, the early history of the short-tailed bird group is poorly understood because of the limited known diversity of early branching pygostylians. Here, we describe a basal member of the short-tailed bird group, Jinguofortis perplexus, from the Early Cretaceous of China. This discovery increases the known ecomorphological diversity of basal pygostylians and highlights the importance of developmental plasticity for understanding the evolution of the avian body plan. The presence of a fused scapulocoracoid in adult individuals independently evolved in Jinguofortisidae and Confuciusornithiformes may relate to an accelerated osteogenesis during chondrogenesis and likely formed through the heterochronic process of peramorphosis by which these basal taxa retain the scapulocoracoid of the nonavian theropod ancestors with the addition of flight-related modifications. With wings having a low aspect ratio and wing loading, Jinguofortis may have been adapted particularly to dense forest environments. The discovery of Jinguofortis increases our understanding of the evolution of the avian body plan and the"

In this study, we describe a mechanism that allows animals to change their color in a physiological way.

This discovery provides a molecular basis for the evolution of color change in vertebrates. It also shows that the serpin superfamily, the largest group of protease inhibitors, has a remarkable functional diversification.

The ability of breast cancer cells to form tumorigenic cells, which are referred to as cancer stem cells (CSCs), is a major obstacle to successful treatment. In this study, we show that hypoxia induces expression of the m6A demethylase AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), which in turn increases the expression of the pluripotency factor NANOG and the breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) phenotype. ALKBH5 expression is induced by hypoxia through the hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1α and HIF-2α, which in turn are activated by hypoxia. Thus, ALKBH5 expression is a key mechanism by which hypoxia promotes the BCSC phenotype. These findings provide a mechanism for how hypoxia may promote the development of CSCs in breast cancer.

The source of this parchment has been a long-standing controversy in codicology. Here, we report a simple and objective method to identify the animal origin of parchment. The method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals, but did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides. These results suggest that ultrafine vellum does not necessarily derive from the use of abortive or newborn animals with ultrathin hides, but could equally well reflect a production process that allowed the skins of maturing animals of several species to be rendered into vellum of equal quality and fineness.

The extinction occurred between 251.941 ± 0.037 and 251.880 ± 0.031 Mya, an interval of 60 ± 48 ka. Onset of a major reorganization of the carbon cycle immediately precedes the initiation of extinction and is punctuated by a sharp (3‰), short-lived negative spike in the isotopic composition of carbonate carbon. Carbon cycle volatility persists for ∼500 ka before a return to near preextinction values. Decamillenial to millennial level resolution of the mass extinction and its aftermath will permit a refined evaluation of the relative roles of rate-dependent processes contributing to the extinction, allowing insight into postextinction ecosystem expansion, and establish an accurate time point for evaluating the plausibility of trigger and kill mechanisms."

However, the information they provide is qualitative and subjective, and is not easily amenable to quantitative analysis. We propose a method to convert the original qualitative data into a continuous, probabilistic variable better suited to quantitative analysis. We show that the resulting model is statistically robust and maintains similar characteristics across different crops, exhibit long-term stability, and has nation-wide validity. We discuss the origin and interpretation of existing spatial and temporal biases in the survey data. Finally, we demonstrate how this index can be used to monitor crop status and provide earlier and more precise predictions of crop yields than official USDA forecasts released midseason.

Here we propose a model of memory that is based on the adaptive changes in excitability that occur in neurons during normal processing. We show that these changes in neuronal excitability can be used to store information in a dynamic memory register. This mechanism is sensitive to context and serial order and is suitable for temporal integration in sequence processing within the language domain.

Our analysis reveals no significant differences in the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration between control and warmed plots in all biomes, with the exception of deserts and boreal forests. Thus, our data provide limited evidence of acclimation of soil respiration to experimental warming in several major biome types, contrary to the results from multiple single-site studies. Our analysis adds a unique cross-biome perspective on the temperature response of soil respiration, information critical to improving our mechanistic understanding of how soil carbon dynamics change with climatic warming.

The contribution of anthropogenic climate change to this prolonged rainfall deficit has previously been evaluated through observations and climate models. However, model adequacy and insufficient horizontal resolution make it difficult to precisely quantify the changing likelihood of extreme droughts, given the small regional scale. Here, we use a high-resolution large ensemble to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the probability of occurrence of multiyear SSA rainfall deficits in past and future decades. We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% by the year 2100 under an intermediate-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5) and to 80% under a high-emission scenario (SSP5-8.5).

Neuroinflammation is associated with the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase ASK1, which is a key regulator of neuroinflammation. In this study, we found that ASK1 in microglia/macrophages plays a major role in the generation and maintenance of neuroinflammation. ASK1 deficiency in T cells and dendritic cells had no significant effects on EAE severity. Further, we found that ASK1 in microglia/macrophages induces a proinflammatory environment, which subsequently activates astrocytes to exacerbate neuroinflammation. Microglia-specific ASK1 deletion was achieved using a CX3CR1CreER system, and we found that ASK1 signaling in microglia played a major role in generating and maintaining disease. Activated astrocytes produce key inflammatory mediators, including CCL2, that further activated and recruited microglia/macrophages, in an astrocytic ASK1-dependent manner.

The drought began in 2012 and now includes the lowest calendar-year and 12-mo precipitation, the highest annual temperature, and the most extreme drought indicators on record. The extremely warm and dry conditions have led to acute water shortages, groundwater overdraft, critically low streamflow, and enhanced wildfire risk. We find that precipitation deficits in California were more than twice as likely to yield drought years if they occurred when conditions were warm. We find that although there has not been a substantial change in the probability of either negative or moderately negative precipitation anomalies in recent decades, the occurrence of drought years has been greater in the past two decades than in the preceding century. In addition, the probability that precipitation deficits co-occur with warm conditions and the probability that precipitation deficits produce drought have both increased. We conclude that anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of co-occurring warm–dry conditions like those that have created the acute human and ecosystem impacts associated with the “exceptional” 2012–2014 drought in California."

Therefore, it is difficult to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a framework for understanding the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms and suggests a potential therapeutic target. (PsycINFO Database Record"

This is a well-established fact. However, the rate of sea level rise is not constant. In fact, it is accelerating. This acceleration is a result of the melting of glaciers and ice sheets and the expansion of the ocean as it warms. We use satellite altimeter data to estimate the acceleration of global mean sea level over the last 25 y and find that it is 0.084 ± 0.025 mm/y2. This acceleration is consistent with the climate models used to estimate future sea level rise. The acceleration is also consistent with the IPCC AR5 projections."

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis remain unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We found that pol II stalling at O2-EtdT and N3-EtdT sites is exacerbated by TFIIS-stimulated proofreading activity. Assessment for the impact of the EtdT lesions on individual fidelity checkpoints provided further mechanistic insights, where the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion. For the N3-EtdT lesion that disrupts base pairing, multiple transcriptional lesion bypass routes were found. Finally, we identified"

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas the more rigid uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into"

Here we present a mathematical analysis of the within-host dynamics of ZIKV in a nonhuman primate model. We estimate the growth and clearance of ZIKV within individual macaques, allowing for characterization of the disease progression. We also assess the potential effect of an antiviral treatment, showing that the median time to undetectable plasma viral load can be reduced from ∼5 d to ∼3 d with a drug concentration ∼15 times the drug’s EC50 when treatment is given prophylactically starting at the time of infection. In the case of favipiravir, a polymerase inhibitor with activity against ZIKV, we predict a dose of 150 mg/kg given twice a day initiated at the time of infection can reduce the peak median viral load by ∼3 logs and shorten the time to undetectable median viral load by ∼2 d. These results provide insights into the disease progression and the potential effect of antiviral treatment, which may be useful for the design of a treatment strategy. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis is driven by altered nutrient cycling during heat stress. This shift from nutrient uptake to release by the coral host promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates, leading to the functional loss of the coral–algal symbiosis. Our results provide a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

In this study, we investigate the consequences of tumorigenesis on the microbiome and the microbiome on tumorigenesis. We show that upon loss of BMP signaling, tumors lead to aberrant activation of JNK/Mmp2 signaling, followed by intestinal barrier dysfunction and commensal imbalance. In turn, the dysbiotic microbiome triggers a regenerative response and stimulates tumor growth. We find that inhibiting JNK signaling or depletion of the microbiome restores barrier function of the intestinal epithelium, leading to a reestablishment of host–microbe homeostasis, and organismic lifespan extension. Our experiments identify a JNK-dependent feedback amplification loop between intestinal tumors and the microbiome. They also highlight the importance of controlling the activity level of JNK signaling to maintain epithelial barrier function and host–microbe homeostasis.

Here, we report that stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is selectively expressed in SANCs and plays a critical role in the regulation of SAN function. STIM1 regulates Ca2+ dynamics in SANCs by influencing the activity of store-operated Ca2+ entry, L-type Ca2+ current, and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. These studies reveal that STIM1 is a multifunctional regulator of Ca2+ dynamics in SANCs that links SR Ca2+ store content with electrical events occurring in the plasma membrane, thereby contributing to automaticity of the SAN. This study provides insights into the mechanisms underlying SAN function and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of heart failure. (Show more)"

However, its role in plant defense against insect herbivores has not been well understood. In this study, we found that Si pretreatment increased rice resistance against the rice leaffolder in wild-type plants but not in two RNAi lines that were silenced for jasmonate (JA) biosynthesis and perception genes. This interaction between Si and JA in defense against insect herbivores was associated with priming of JA-mediated defense responses and promotion of JA accumulation. These results suggest that Si may be used as a biocontrol agent to protect plants against insect herbivores. (Show more)"

This ability is thought to be supported by elevated neural activity. However, other work has suggested that short-term synaptic facilitation can also contribute to memory. Here we propose a model of memory that is based on the adaptive changes in excitability that occur in neurons during normal processing. We show that these changes in neuronal excitability can be used to store information in a dynamic memory register. This mechanism is sensitive to context and serial order and can bind linguistic features over time. This work provides a step toward a computational neurobiology of language. It also provides a framework for understanding the neural basis of language processing."

Here, we show that certification is associated with reduced deforestation in Indonesia, the world’s leading producer of palm oil. However, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation.

We find that multiple alleles can produce modular variation in morphological and behavioral traits, and that the evolution of a new sex determination allele can create additional axes of variation for varied traits. These results provide context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations.

We show that siphonophore specialists can evolve into generalists, and that specialists on one prey type have directly evolved into specialists on other prey types. These findings contribute to understanding how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs. They also help build a broader perspective on predatory niche diversification via morphological innovation and evolution. This is important for understanding the functioning of ecosystems."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants.
