The structure of ice II is also of great importance for the understanding of the properties of hydrates, which are important in the petroleum and natural gas industries. In this work, we report the synthesis and structure of a hydrate of neon hydrate. The structure of neon hydrate is similar to that of ice II, which suggests that the structure of ice II is the result of the enclathration of guest atoms. This work provides a new perspective on the structure of ice II and the properties of hydrates. It also provides a new method for the synthesis of hydrates. This work is expected to be of interest to researchers in the fields of chemistry, physics, and geology."

The evolutionary origin of this group has been elusive, and a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we present a genomic and transcriptomic analysis of two distantly related myxozoan species and a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results show that the myxozoan body plan was reduced to a minimal structure, and that the genome was reduced to one of the smallest reported in animals. We also show that the myxozoan genome is highly reduced in gene content, and that the loss of genes is correlated with the loss of cellular function. These results provide insight into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)."

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 evades the host immune response and may lead to the development of new strategies to combat the ongoing pandemic.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because species-level identification of food plants is prohibitively difficult with traditional methods. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammal species in semiarid African savanna. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers. Grass consumption was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of grass consumption, indicating that RRA conveys reliable quantitative information about consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized."

However, the global load of plastic debris on the open ocean surface is still unknown. We show that the global load of floating plastic debris is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This is due to size-selective sinks, which remove plastic fragments of millimeters in size. These sinks are likely to be a combination of processes in the ocean interior, such as fragmentation, and processes in the food web, such as ballasting. This study provides a better understanding of the fate of plastic debris in the ocean and is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

A Threonine to Alanine substitution at this position was studied in three representative members of the K+-channel family.

A state-dependent crystallographic study of KcsA-T75A proves that, on activation, the selectivity filter transitions from a nonconductive and deep C-type inactivated conformation to a conductive one. Finally, we provide a crystallographic demonstration that closed-state inactivation can be achieved by the structural collapse of the channel’s selectivity filter.

Here we show that anxiety, a personality trait, directly influences social dominance in male outbred rats and identify an important mediating role for mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens. High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low-anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as decreased ATP and increased ROS production in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious individuals. We conclude that mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens is crucial for social behavior and is critically involved in the low social competitiveness associated with high anxiety. Our findings highlight a key role for brain energy metabolism in social behavior and point to mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens as a potential marker and avenue of treatment for anxiety-related social disorders."

These findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure.

This problem can be addressed by the development of new antibacterial agents to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. Computational approaches are essential tools to this end since their application enables fast and early strategical decisions in the drug development process. We present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. The best compounds are synthetically more accessible, exhibit higher solubility and binding affinity to the ribosome, and are up to 56 times more active against resistant pathogens than telithromycin. These results demonstrate the potential of our design strategy to develop new antibiotics. This article is protected by copyright. All"

However, in contrast to congenital deficiency, this was not fatal. CTLA-4 deletion induced preferential expansion of Treg cells, but T cells from CTLA-4–deficient inducible KO mice were able to induce the diseases in recipient mice. This indicates that CTLA-4 deficiency affects both central and peripheral tolerance and Treg cell-mediated suppression.

We found that larger populations generated greater variation in plane performance and gave participants access to better-adapted planes, but this did not enhance CCE.

Future studies should focus on the role of ectoparasites in the spread of other diseases, such as malaria. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

One approach is to target the molecular pathways that are deregulated in cancer. In this study, we show that TRAP1, a mitochondrial molecular chaperone, is a potential therapeutic target. We show that TRAP1 is broadly expressed in normal cells, but is down-regulated in some cancers. We also show that TRAP1 is required for the metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1 may act as a tumor suppressor in some settings. These data suggest that TRAP1 may be a useful target for cancer therapy.

It is known to sever actin filaments, but how it does so is not understood. Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to study the action of ADF in different mechanical situations. We find that ADF binds to actin filaments and that filament curvature favors severing. Surprisingly, tension has no effect on ADF binding or severing. We also find that ADF-induced filament torque enhances severing. A simple model, which faithfully reproduces our experimental observations, indicates that the ADF-induced torque increases the severing rate constant 100-fold. We propose that this mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. Our work provides a mechanism for how ADF/cofilin, and other ADF-related proteins, sever actin filaments in cells. This mechanism may be relevant to other ADF-related diseases."

Here, we show that, in Escherichia coli cells experiencing such stress, the RNA pyrophosphohydrolase RppH assumes a leading role in decapping those transcripts, preferring them as substrates over their triphosphorylated and diphosphorylated counterparts. Unexpectedly, this enzyme recognizes N-capped 5′ ends by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5′ termini, resulting in a one-nucleotide shift in substrate specificity. The unique manner in which capped substrates of this kind bind to the active site of RppH positions the δ-phosphate, rather than the β-phosphate, for hydrolytic attack, generating triphosphorylated RNA as the primary product of decapping. This study provides insight into the mechanisms by which bacteria reprogram gene expression during stress. (Read more)"

Here, we report the solution structure of a unique NCR peptide, which is a member of the largest family of legume-specific peptides. The structure of the peptide was largely disordered and highly dynamic. The peptide exhibited potent antifungal activity against multiple plant fungal pathogens, including Botrytis cinerea and three Fusarium spp. It was able to penetrate the fungal cell wall and membrane, and induce reactive oxygen species in germlings. The peptide was able to bind to multiple bioactive phosphoinositides in vitro. The peptide was able to significantly reduce gray mold disease symptoms caused by the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea in tomato and tobacco plants. Our work illustrates the antifungal activity of a structurally unique NCR peptide against plant fungal pathogens and paves the way for future development of this class of peptides as a spray-on fungistat/fungicide.

We induced C-type inactivation in BK channels and studied the relationship between activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery. We observed prominent slow C-type inactivation/recovery in BK channels by an extreme low concentration of extracellular K+ together with a Y294E/K/Q/S or Y279F mutation whose equivalent in Shaker channels (T449E/K/D/Q/S or W434F) caused a greatly accelerated rate of C-type inactivation or constitutive C-inactivation.

Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

The chemical influence of air pollution on aerosol particles contributes to the aerosol cooling. Since aerosols mask the anthropogenic rise in global temperature, removing fossil-fuel-generated particles liberates 0.51 °C and all pollution particles 0.73 °C warming, reaching around 2 °C over North America and Northeast Asia. The steep temperature increase from removing aerosols can be moderated to about 0.36 °C globally by the simultaneous reduction of tropospheric ozone and methane.

We validated the framework using data from a virus discovery project and public records of virus detections around the world. The resulting ranking of viruses can be used by policy makers and health scientists to inform research and public health interventions for prevention and rapid control of disease outbreaks. SpillOver is a living, interactive database that can be refined over time to continue to improve the quality and public availability of information on viral threats to human health.

One of the main rewards that plants offer to pollinators is nectar. One of the most common colors of nectar is red, which is attractive to vertebrate pollinators. However, the mechanism by which red nectar is produced is unknown. Here, we show that the red color of nectar is derived from a previously undescribed alkaloid, nesocodin. We also identify a second alkaloid, nesocodonine, which is produced in the same glands as nesocodin. We demonstrate that nesocodonine is also attractive to vertebrate pollinators. We further show that nesocodonine is produced by the same three enzymes that are necessary for the production of red nectar. Our findings provide insight into the evolution of red nectar and the discovery of a second alkaloid that is attractive to vertebrate pollinators. This work also demonstrates that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation. This work also provides a model for the evolution of red nectar in other plants."

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. First, whereas MERS-CoV prefers human DPP4 over bat DPP4 as its receptor, HKU4 shows the opposite trend. Second, in the absence of exogenous proteases, both MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes mediate pseudovirus entry into bat cells, whereas only MERS-CoV spike, but not HKU4 spike, mediates pseudovirus entry into human cells.

Here, we show that an improved RNA polymerase ribozyme can replicate RNA, amplifying short templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of PCR.

First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

The method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals; however, we did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides.

The age of the extinction is 251.941 ± 0.037 and 251.880 ± 0.031 Mya, an interval of 60 ± 48 ka. The carbon cycle was highly variable during the extinction, and the recovery of the carbon cycle may have been a key factor in the recovery of the biota.

IBD is a complex disease with a high incidence and poor prognosis. The pathogenesis of IBD is complex and involves multiple factors. In this study, we found that retinoic acid-related orphan receptor α (RORα) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of IBD. We generated intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific RORα-deficient (RORαΔIEC) mice and found that RORα is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis by attenuating nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcriptional activity. RORαΔIEC mice exhibit excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis reveals corecruitment of RORα and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) on NF-κB target promoters and subsequent dismissal of CREB binding protein (CBP) and bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) for transcriptional repression.

We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML.

We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR).

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral phenotypes of autism-risk genes and a potential target for the treatment of autism.

The disease is characterized by the formation of intracellular inclusion bodies that contain a variety of proteins that do not share obvious characteristics other than coaggregation. Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions in ALS are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. To explain the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in the brain and spinal cord, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. Our results suggest that the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in ALS may be a consequence of the disease-related progressive loss of protein homeostasis in motor neurons. This may be a general phenomenon in neurodegenerative diseases. This study may help to identify potential therapeutic targets for ALS. ("

Virions must first be secreted from virus-producing cells, and then bind to target-cell receptors. We show that sequential proteolysis of the S glycoproteins contributes to MERS-CoV infection. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages.

In this study, we describe the distribution of recombination across the genome of a flowering plant, using a population sequencing approach. We find that recombination is highly variable across the genome, with some regions experiencing many crossovers, while others experience none. We also find that recombination is polarized, with the highest rates occurring near the start of genes. These results are similar to those observed in yeast and in mice, suggesting that the patterns we describe may be ancient and conserved."

The role of the recently identified cancer antigen, fibrous sheath interacting protein 1 (FSIP1), in TNBC is unknown. Here, we show that FSIP1 is expressed in the majority of TNBC and is associated with poor prognosis. FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. This article is protected by copyright.

However, these two threats are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function.

In vertebrates, sex determination is often a single locus, but in some species, multiple sex determination alleles interact to produce more than two genotypic sexes. Here we investigate the effects of polygenic sex determination in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii, where two alleles interact to produce four possible sex classes: ZZXX females, ZWXX females, ZWXY females, and ZZXY males. We find that polygenic sex determination can produce modular variation in morphological and behavioral traits, and that the introgression of a newly acquired sex determiner can create additional axes of variation for varied traits. These results provide context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations.

We show that the intracellular levels of iron, which are elevated in the retina, promote the oxidation and degradation of these adducts. These findings have implications for the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in the elderly. The results also suggest that the addition of iron chelators to current therapies for age-related macular degeneration may be beneficial. This article is protected by copyright.

However, the evolution of predator specialization has been considered an evolutionary dead end. Here we show that siphonophores, a group of pelagic cnidarians, have evolved a modular morphology that allows them to capture prey using specialized structures that are dedicated to prey capture. Our results show that siphonophores have evolved to capture different prey types, and that the evolution of siphonophore specialization has been linked to the evolution of their morphology. These findings help us understand how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs. They also provide insights into the evolution of predator morphology and the diversification of predatory niches."

The evolution of the human hand has been a focus of intense study for many decades, but fundamental questions remain about the origins of the derived features that characterize the modern human hand. Here we report the discovery of a hominin hand fossil from East Africa that preserves the third metacarpal styloid process, a key derived feature of the human hand that is absent in early hominins. This fossil provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of this feature and suggests that it arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo. This finding has important implications for our understanding of the evolution of the human hand and the origins of modern human-like tool use. (Read more)"

One of the key metabolic pathways that supports cell growth is the one-carbon unit cycle, which is supported by the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). Here we report the discovery of small-molecule dual inhibitors of SHMT1 and SHMT2, which block cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. We also report a surprising finding that cancer cells in one particular cancer type, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, are uniquely dependent upon SHMT enzymatic activity to meet glycine demand. This finding provides a potential target for the treatment of this cancer. The discovery of this dependence on SHMT activity is a significant advance in our understanding of the metabolic vulnerabilities of this cancer. This work also provides a proof-of-concept for the use of small-molecule dual inhibitors of SHMT1/2 as a cancer therapeutic. This approach has the potential to be broadly applicable to other cancers.

The results have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. The study also highlights the importance of considering the role of natural landscapes in meeting nutrition goals, particularly in rural areas of low- and middle-income countries."

This has led to a chronic compaction of the soil, which is now at risk of irreversible damage. We show that the weight of farm machinery has increased so much that the subsoil is now at risk of compaction. We developed a global map of subsoil compaction susceptibility, which shows that 20% of arable land is at risk of subsoil compaction. This alarming trend calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest land animals, the sauropods, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This study highlights the need for a more sustainable use of farm machinery and the need to consider the ecological footprint of modern agriculture. It also suggests that the weight of farm machinery may have been a limiting factor for the evolution of the largest land animals. This article"
