In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 evades the host immune response and may help in the development of new therapeutic strategies to combat the ongoing pandemic.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of the proton channel. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits the channel will further our understanding of the channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for the channel.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammals in semiarid African savanna. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers. Grass consumption was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of grass consumption, indicating that RRA conveys reliable quantitative information about consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammal assemblages, and that large mammal diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.

We show that the NWFP has not yet achieved its goals. The policy halted clearcutting on federal land, but this has so far been insufficient to reverse declines in older-forest–associated bird populations. We also show that the early-seral ecosystem area was stable, but declined in two ecoregions—the Coast Range and Cascades—along with early-seral bird populations. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure. Our results also highlight the need for more effective monitoring of the effects of forest policy. This study provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the influence of policy.

Computational approaches are essential tools to this end since their application enables fast and early strategical decisions in the drug development process. We present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. The best compounds are synthetically more accessible, exhibit higher solubility and binding affinity to the ribosome, and are up to 56 times more active against resistant pathogens than telithromycin. These results demonstrate the potential of our design strategy to develop new antibiotics. This approach can be extended to other antibiotic classes and can be used to screen for new compounds with improved properties. This article is protected by copyright. All"

We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data. Our results suggest that the proposed architecture is a promising alternative to existing architectures for many problems.

This was not fatal, but led to the development of organ-specific autoantibodies. CTLA-4 deletion induced preferential expansion of CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells. However, T cells from CTLA-4–deficient inducible KO mice were able to induce the diseases in recipient mice. This indicates that CTLA-4 deficiency affects both central and peripheral tolerance and Treg cell-mediated suppression.

We introduce a new class of algorithms, fast iterative restarted networks (FIRENETs), which are stable and can find a solution to a given accuracy with only a few iterations.

We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This study provides a more complete understanding of the role of TRAP1 in mitochondria and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.

It is also a promising drug target for cancer treatment. However, the molecular mechanism of ADF action is not understood. Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to study the action of ADF in different mechanical situations. We find that ADF binding to actin filaments enhances the rate of severing, and that this enhancement is enhanced by a mechanical torque. We propose that this mechanism is critical to boost ADF’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. Our findings provide a molecular understanding of ADF’s action and may lead to the design of new drugs. They also have implications for our understanding of the action of other proteins that use mechanical forces to regulate their action."

To understand the mechanism of this temperature-dependent growth, we compared the transcriptional response of primary mouse airway epithelial cells infected with rhinovirus at 33 °C vs. 37 °C. We found that mouse airway cells infected with mouse-adapted rhinovirus exhibited a striking enrichment in expression of antiviral defense response genes at 37 °C relative to 33 °C.

However, it is difficult to be well represented in current climate models. This is due to the complexity of the interaction process and the lack of observational capability. Here, we introduce a new instrument, the dual-field-of-view high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL), to investigate the ACI process. The instrument can simultaneously measure aerosol and cloud properties, especially cloud microphysical properties. We demonstrate the capability of the instrument by conducting observations over Beijing. The observations show that the aerosol loading has no discernible effect on the liquid water path but increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius. This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI process. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI.

They open and close their pore gates to allow or block ion flow. K+ channels commonly possess two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also found that C-type inactivation in BK channels is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. Our findings provide insights into the mechanism of K+ channel regulation. (Show more)"

In the temperate regions, seasonal influenza virus outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in ambient humidity. While low ambient humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

Globally, fossil-fuel-related emissions account for about 65% of the excess mortality, and 70% of the climate cooling by anthropogenic aerosols. Aerosols affect the hydrologic cycle, contributing to water and food security. Since aerosols mask the anthropogenic rise in global temperature, removing fossil-fuel-generated particles liberates 0.51 °C and all pollution particles 0.73 °C warming, reaching around 2 °C over North America and Northeast Asia. The steep temperature increase from removing aerosols can be moderated to about 0.36 °C globally by the simultaneous reduction of tropospheric ozone and methane. We conclude that a rapid phaseout of fossil-fuel-related emissions and major reductions of other anthropogenic sources are needed to save millions of lives, restore aerosol-perturbed rainfall patterns, and limit global warming to 2 °C."

We also identify a convergently evolved trait in two vertebrate-pollinated species, suggesting that the red pigment is selectively favored and that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation. This work cumulatively identifies a convergently evolved trait in two vertebrate-pollinated species, suggesting that the red pigment is selectively favored and that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation.

In addition, we show that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago. These results indicate that complex demographic processes during the Early Medieval period may have contributed in an unexpected way to shape the modern European genetic landscape."

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. First, whereas MERS-CoV prefers human DPP4 over bat DPP4 as its receptor, HKU4 shows the opposite trend. Second, in the absence of exogenous proteases, both MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes mediate pseudovirus entry into bat cells, whereas only MERS-CoV spike, but not HKU4 spike, mediates pseudovirus entry into human cells. Thus, MERS-CoV, but not HKU4, has adapted to"

We find that the more infectious variant contains a range of more open conformations that may facilitate binding to the receptor and the subsequent structural rearrangements required for membrane fusion. These results provide insights into the structural basis of the increased infectivity of the currently circulating variants. (Show more)

The Black and Latino populations are estimated to experience declines in life expectancy at birth of 2.10 and 3.05 y, respectively, both of which are several times the 0.68-y reduction for Whites. Latinos, who have consistently experienced lower mortality than Whites, would see their more than 3-y survival advantage reduced to less than 1 y.

There is an urgent need for novel and more efficient therapies, ideally targeting AML stem cells that are essential for maintaining the disease. Here, we show that monoclonal antibodies targeting interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This study provides a proof of principle that IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent"

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

We present a model of the trajectory of plastid genome evolution during the transition from autotrophy to a parasitic lifestyle. We show that the transition to a parasitic lifestyle relaxes functional constraints on the genome, and that the extent of the relaxation is linked to the macrostructural and microstructural changes in the plastid genome. Our findings suggest that the transition to a parasitic lifestyle is a gradual process, with bursts of gene losses coinciding with periods of relaxed selection. The evolutionary rates in the retained functional complexes are several times higher than the background rate, possibly relating to the modified protein turnover rates in heterotrophic plastids. This model can be used to infer the evolutionary history of the plastid genome and to reconstruct the macroevolutionary history of the host.

In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. Our study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral deficits in autism and suggests a potential therapeutic target. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)."

To better understand the mechanisms of MERS-CoV infection, we engineered MERS viruses with mutations that block sequential proteolysis of the spike (S) glycoproteins. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence. This study provides insights into the mechanisms of MERS-CoV infection and may help to identify strategies to control this deadly pathogen. (PsycInfo Database Record ("

Here we report that hypobaric hypoxia induces cerebral edema and neuronal apoptosis in rats. We also show that this effect is mediated by the release of corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) from the hypothalamus, which acts on the cerebral cortex via its receptor CRFR1 to trigger signaling of cAMP/PKA in astrocytes, leading to activation of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and cerebral edema. These findings provide a molecular mechanism for the pathogenesis of cerebral edema induced by hypobaric hypoxia. They also suggest that CRFR1 agonists may be useful in the treatment of cerebral edema. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)."

Accumulating evidence indicates that STING plays an important role in the regulation of insulin sensitivity. However, its function in β-cells remains unknown. Herein, we revealed a distinct role of STING in the regulation of glucose homeostasis through peripheral tissues and β-cells. Specially, although STING deficiency alleviated insulin resistance and glucose intolerance induced by high-fat diet, it surprisingly impaired islet glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Importantly, STING-βKO caused glucose intolerance due to impaired GSIS, indicating that STING is required for normal β-cell function. Islet transcriptome analysis suggested that STING deficiency decreased expression of β-cell function–related genes, contributing to impaired GSIS. These data revealed a function of STING in the regulation of insulin secretion and established pathophysiological significance of fine-tuned STING within β-cells and insulin target tissues for maintaining glucose homeostasis.

The role of a recently identified cancer antigen, fibrous sheath interacting protein 1 (FSIP1), in TNBC is unknown. Here, we show that FSIP1 is expressed in the majority of TNBCs and is associated with poor prognosis. FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. Thus, our study provides insights into the role of FSIP1 in TNBC and"

Here we show that the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is sensitive to changes in temperature. We found that the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning changed as temperatures deviated from ambient conditions. This change in the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning was driven by two processes. First, more diverse communities were more likely to include species with thermal traits that enabled them to maintain productivity as temperatures shifted from ambient conditions. Second, we found a pronounced increase in the contribution of complementarity to the net biodiversity effect at high and low temperatures, indicating that changes in species interactions played a critical role in mediating the impacts of temperature change on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. This study highlights the importance of considering the combined effects of biodiversity loss and environmental warming on ecosystem functioning. This is particularly important in the context of climate change, where the effects of global warming are expected to be more severe in the tropics."

One of the key metabolic pathways that supports cell growth is the one-carbon unit pathway, which is supported by the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). We have developed a small-molecule inhibitor of SHMT, which we use to identify a role for SHMT in cancer. We show that SHMT is required for colon cancer tumor growth, and that a small-molecule inhibitor of SHMT is effective in a cancer cell-line screen. We also show that a deficiency in glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a cancer that is notoriously difficult to treat. Thus, our work identifies a metabolic target for cancer therapy, and a cancer type that is uniquely dependent upon this target. This work also provides a proof-of-concept for the use of small-molecule inhibitors of SHMT in the clinic."

However, little attention is paid to the role of natural landscapes such as forests in meeting nutrition goals. This study shows that deforestation can have negative effects on people’s diets, and that this effect is exacerbated when forests are fragmented. The results have important implications for policy makers, as forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals."

We show that this increase in weight has led to a significant increase in subsoil compaction, which now exceeds safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We hypothesize that this trend is a result of the lack of ecological constraints on the roaming of sauropods, which would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles. Our results suggest that the roaming of sauropods may have been a key factor in the decline of these giants, and that the ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This study highlights the importance of considering the effects of mechanization on soil ecology, and the need for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits.
