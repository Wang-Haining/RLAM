Here, we present a genomic and transcriptomic analysis of two distantly related myxozoan species and a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results support a sister relationship between the Myxozoa and cnidarians and suggest that the extreme reduction in the genome and gene content of the Myxozoa was accompanied by a reduction in the complexity of the body plan.

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of the proton channel. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits the channel will further our understanding of the channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for the channel.

This is due to the size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale.

A Threonine to Alanine substitution at this position was studied in three representative members of the K+-channel family. Interestingly, all of the mutant channels exhibited lack of C-type inactivation gating and an inversion of their allosteric coupling (i.e., closing of the activation gate collapses the channel’s selectivity filter). A state-dependent crystallographic study of KcsA-T75A proves that, on activation, the selectivity filter transitions from a nonconductive and deep C-type inactivated conformation to a conductive one. Finally, we provide a crystallographic demonstration that closed-state inactivation can be achieved by the structural collapse of the channel’s selectivity filter. This study provides a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the gating of potassium channels. It also provides a new paradigm for the design of potassium channel modulators."

Here we show that anxiety directly influences social dominance in male outbred rats and identify an important mediating role for mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens. High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low-anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as increased oxidative stress in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals. We conclude that mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens is crucial for social behavior and is critically involved in the low social competitiveness associated with high anxiety.

This resistance is mediated by the activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. In addition, we found that SREBP1 mediates ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells through the transcriptional activation of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a key enzyme in the production of monounsaturated fatty acids.

This problem can be addressed by the development of new antibacterial agents to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. Computational approaches are essential tools to this end since their application enables fast and early strategical decisions in the drug development process. Here, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. Our study provides a proof of concept for the rational design of new antibiotics. (Show more)"

The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters, and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data."

This is the first demonstration of a decapping enzyme that can recognize capped 5′ termini in a manner distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5′ termini. The unique manner in which capped substrates bind to the active site of RppH positions the δ-phosphate, rather than the β-phosphate, for hydrolytic attack, generating triphosphorylated RNA as the primary product of decapping.

The two gates are spatially separated in most channels, but the K+ channel BK lacks an intracellular activation gate and shows no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. This study provides a new perspective on the relationship between the two gates and the regulation of ion flow in ion channels. (Show more)"

Here, we show that the malaria parasite alters the physical properties of the host cell, increasing the tension of the cytoskeleton and reducing the bending rigidity of the membrane, which leads to an increase in invasion efficiency. This study provides a new perspective on the invasion process and opens up new avenues for the development of new antimalarial drugs. (Show more)"

More superficial models of language, based on sequential transition probabilities, only captured activity in the posterior middle temporal gyrus. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases.

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA."

However, the lack of a standardized and systematic way to collect and analyze their data has hindered the development of more accurate and timely crop monitoring systems. We propose a method to convert the original qualitative data from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Crop Progress and Condition (CPC) survey into a continuous, probabilistic variable that can be used to monitor crop conditions and predict crop yields. We show that the CPC reflects the subjective perception of many surveyors at different locations, but the underlying models that describe the reported crop status are statistically robust and maintain similar characteristics across different crops, exhibit long-term stability, and have nation-wide validity. We discuss the origin and interpretation of existing spatial and temporal biases in the survey data. Finally, we demonstrate how this index can be used to monitor crop conditions and provide earlier and more precise predictions of crop yields than official USDA forecasts released midseason. Our findings have implications for the development of more accurate and timely crop monitoring systems that can be used to support agricultural decision-making."

We used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. Our findings provide a new approach to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. This approach may be useful for the identification of the causal genes and the elucidation of the mechanisms of autism. (PsycINFO Database Record"

Here, we describe the application of NMR-assisted crystallography to the study of the tryptophan synthase α-aminoacrylate intermediate, a defining species for pyridoxal-5′-phosphate–dependent enzymes that catalyze β-elimination and replacement reactions. This integrated approach is able to provide atomic-resolution characterization of the active site, including the protonation states of the cofactor, substrate, and catalytic side chains, as well as the location and orientation of crystallographic waters within the active site. This detailed picture of structure and reactivity emerges, highlighting the fate of the L-serine hydroxyl leaving group and the reaction pathway back to the preceding transition state. This work provides a chemically detailed, three-dimensional structure of the active site, which is key to understanding why the natural substrate indole reacts, while benzimidazole does not. This work also demonstrates the potential of NMR-assisted crystallography to provide mechanistic insight into the reaction pathways of enzymes. (Show more)"

This glycan is released by host cells in the hours before dusk, when the host is most active. We propose that this strategy is used by hosts to control the activities of their symbiotic communities, and that it may be a general mechanism used by animals to control the activities of their microbial communities.

We found that the three regioisomeric EtdT lesions can induce distinct transcriptional stalling profiles, which are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The results from the present in vitro transcriptional studies are well correlated with in vivo transcriptional mutagenesis analysis. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop), which is involved in modulating the translocation of minor-groove alkylated DNA template after nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion.

To better understand the role of the spike (S) glycoproteins in MERS-CoV infection, we introduced mutations that blocked the sequential cleavage of the S proteins. These mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence.

Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. (Psyc"

We find that the long-time dynamics of such systems are biased toward states that exhibit a fine-tuned extremization of environmental forcing. This behavior is reminiscent of the “optimal fluctuation” phenomenon in physics, which has been observed in a variety of systems. We discuss the implications of our results for the study of complex systems in general and for the design of catalytic systems in particular."

However, most studies focused on short-term warming events superimposed on longer-term greenhouse climate states. Here, we present an integrated proxy (carbon and uranium [U] isotopes and paleo CO2) and multicomponent modeling approach to investigate an abrupt C perturbation and global warming event (∼304 Ma) that occurred during a paleo-glacial state. We report pronounced negative C and U isotopic excursions coincident with a doubling of atmospheric CO2 partial pressure and a biodiversity nadir. The isotopic excursions can be linked to an injection of organic matter–derived C over ∼300 kyr and to near 20% of areal extent of seafloor anoxia. Earth system modeling indicates that widespread anoxic conditions can be linked to enhanced thermocline stratification and increased nutrient fluxes during this global warming within an icehouse. This study highlights the importance of the timing of the C cycle in the history of the Earth system."

We show that RSPO certification is associated with a 33% reduction in deforestation in oil palm plantations, but that certification has no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection. Our results suggest that certification is not yet having a large impact on deforestation, and that certification is not a silver bullet for the palm oil industry."

The exocyst complex is involved in the regulation of plant growth and development, and its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and offers a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

In species with polygenic sex determination, multiple alleles are involved in the determination of sex, resulting in a spectrum of sex classes. Here we investigate the effects of polygenic sex determination on secondary sexual characteristics in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii, where two alleles interact to produce siblings with four possible sex classes. We find that polygenic sex determination can produce modular variation in morphological and behavioral traits, and that the evolution or introgression of a newly acquired sex determiner creates additional axes of phenotypic variation. These results provide context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations. (PsycINFO Database Record"

We sought to understand the role of iron in the retina and found that iron levels impact the retina in a manner that is distinct from its impact in other tissues. In particular, iron levels promote the photooxidation and photodegradation of the retinal photoreceptor pigment A2E. These findings have implications for the understanding of the role of iron in the retina and for the development of strategies to protect the retina from damage. (PsycINFO Database Record"

Here we show that siphonophores, a group of pelagic cnidarians, have evolved to be highly specialized on different prey types, and that these shifts are linked to the evolution of their specialized tentacles. Our findings help to understand how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs, and how this process can be linked to the evolution of morphological innovations."

We also show that the one-carbon donor formate is a potent rescue of SHMT inhibition in colon cancer, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of DLBCL. These studies provide a foundation for the development of SHMT inhibitors as a new class of cancer therapeutics."

The mechanization of agriculture has increased the capacity of farm machinery, but the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We hypothesize that the increase in subsoil compaction risk is a consequence of the increase in vehicle weight, and that this is a consequence of the increase in vehicle size."
