They are also the sister group to the group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids. The evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, and a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we present the first genomic and transcriptomic analyses of two species of myxozoans, which are distantly related, and compare these to the transcriptome and genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results show that the myxozoan body plan was reduced to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian. This reduction was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. (Show more)"

The virus responsible for this pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is able to evade the antiviral action of the immune system by blocking the nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are essential for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Here, we show that the viral accessory protein Orf6 is responsible for this evasion mechanism. We also show that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1, a protein complex that is essential for nuclear import. Our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the viral antagonism mechanism and may lead to the development of new antiviral strategies. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

This increase will be challenging, especially in the tropics, where the optimum growing temperature is exceeded in many years. We show that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields increases almost everywhere to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. They also underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance."

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant African LMH species. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers. Grass consumption was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of % grass consumption, indicating that RRA conveys reliable quantitative information about consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, dietary composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This study provides a framework for understanding the role of LMH in the structure and functioning of African savanna ecosystems. It also provides a model for the use of DNA metabarcoding to study the diet of wild animals. This approach will be critical"

However, the magnitude of the problem is still unclear. We show that the global load of floating plastic debris is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This is due to the selective removal of small plastic fragments by the ocean interior. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

Here, we show that the practice of allonursing, in which a nonbreeding female provides care to a young offspring of a different breeding female, is associated with increased reproductive output. We also show that the increase in reproductive output is due to an increase in the amount of resources available to the mother rather than an increase in the number of litters produced. This result suggests that the limiting factor on reproductive output in placental mammals is the mother’s metabolic power. This finding has important implications for the evolution of all forms of allonursing and the evolution of domestication. (Show more)"

Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. Our findings unravel a mechanism of LCCBs action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. This study provides a rationale for the use of LCCBs in the treatment of hypertension. It also provides a potential target for the development of new drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. (Read more)"

This problem can be addressed by the development of new antibacterial agents to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. In this work, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. This work provides a proof of concept for the use of computational approaches in the rational design of new antibiotics. (Show more)"

Here, we introduce a network architecture that is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters, and that consists of a single set of operations. The proposed architecture is easier to implement, train, and apply in practice, and automatically adapts to different problems. We compare results of the proposed architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data. The proposed architecture is thus a promising tool for applications in computer vision and image processing. The code is available at this https URL ."

Here, we show that APOE isoform regulates the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes, which is highly dependent on APOE isoform. We also found that APOE4 increases the rate of C1q accumulation in the brain, which may represent the accumulation of senescent synapses with enhanced vulnerability to complement-mediated neurodegeneration. These studies reveal a novel role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes and suggest the hypothesis that AD susceptibility of APOE4 may originate in part from defective phagocytic capacity of astrocytes which accelerates the rate of accumulation of senescent synapses, enhancing synaptic vulnerability to complement-mediated neurodegeneration.

It does so by severing the filaments. However, how it does so is not known. Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to study the action of ADF in different mechanical situations. We find that ADF binds to the filament and induces a mechanical torque, which enhances severing. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. We propose that this mechanism is a general principle of ADF action. Our findings have implications for understanding ADF’s role in cell motility and cancer. They also have potential applications in biomaterials and biomechanics."

The distribution of the genomic diversity across the island shows that the colonization was not homogeneous, and that the settlement of Madagascar was not a single event but happened in several waves. The distribution of the genomic diversity also shows that the island has been influenced by the genetic diversity of the continent, and that the genetic diversity of Madagascar is not as unique as previously thought.

We demonstrate that neurons, which are the primary cell type in the brain, are also vulnerable to Aβ toxicity and can produce a variety of potent inflammatory factors. These factors correlate with the extent of microglial activation and mobilization, even in the absence of extracellular plaques and cell death.

However, the earliest evidence for economic exploitation of chickens in the Near East is still unknown. Here we present the results of a faunal analysis of the Hellenistic site of Maresha, Israel, which provides the earliest evidence for economic exploitation of chickens in the Near East. The results of our survey of the Southern Levant further suggest that the adoption of chickens in European husbandry predates the evidence from the Near East by at least a century.

However, it is difficult to be well represented in current climate models. This is due to the lack of observational capability. Here, we introduce a new instrument, the dual-field-of-view high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL), to observe aerosols and clouds simultaneously. This instrument is capable of measuring aerosol and cloud properties with high spatial and temporal resolution. We use this instrument to investigate the interactions between aerosol loading and water cloud microphysical properties. The observations show that increased aerosol loading led to increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius—consistent with expectations—but had no discernible increase on liquid water path. This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations obtained from the dual-FOV HSRL constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI. This paper is expected to provide a significant contribution to the understanding of ACI."

We here present a method for determining the paleotemperature of ancient organisms based on the thermostability of ancestral enzymes reconstructed from ancient and modern organisms. Our results suggest that Earth’s surface temperature decreased over geological time from ∼65–80 °C in the Archean, a finding consistent both with previous isotope-based and protein reconstruction-based interpretations.

They open and close their pore gates to allow or block ion flow. K+ channels commonly possess two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. We found that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. These findings provide insights into the regulation of K+ channel gating and C-type inactivation. They also suggest that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. These findings may also provide a basis for the development of new drugs for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmia. (Read more)"

Here, we show that the malaria parasite’s erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 (EBA175) alters the biophysical properties of the RBC, reducing the energy barrier to invasion. This finding represents a major change in our understanding of malaria invasion and suggests that the parasite and host cell are working together to facilitate invasion.

While low humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

This merge operation is applied equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity, providing evidence for a merge operation that applies equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity. More superficial models of language, based solely on sequential transition probability over lexical and syntactic categories, only captured activity in the posterior middle temporal gyrus.

We find that the spider’s web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to sense the motion of web threads, which allows the spider to remotely detect and localize the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself.

This could be up to 5.55 million per year by additionally controlling nonfossil anthropogenic sources. The chemical influence of air pollution on aeolian dust contributes to the aerosol cooling. Since aerosols mask the anthropogenic rise in global temperature, removing fossil-fuel-generated particles liberates 0.51 °C and all pollution particles 0.73 °C warming, reaching around 2 °C over North America and Northeast Asia. The steep temperature increase from removing aerosols can be moderated to about 0.36 °C globally by the simultaneous reduction of tropospheric ozone and methane.

To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions. Our findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and may help to develop effective vaccines and therapeutics for MERS-CoV. These results also suggest that bat coronaviruses may be a potential threat to human health in the future. (Show more)"

We show that changes in human demography tend to suppress global fire activity, keeping more carbon within terrestrial ecosystems and attenuating warming. However, recent and predicted future reductions in fire activity may enhance land carbon uptake and corresponding to offsetting 5 to 10 y of global CO2 emissions at today’s levels. This potentially reduces warming by up to 0.11 °C by 2100. We show that ignitions and active and passive fire suppression can be as important in driving future fire regimes as changes in climate, although with some risk of more extreme fires regionally and with implications for other ecosystem functions in fire-dependent ecosystems. Our study highlights that ignitions and fire suppression can be as important in driving future fire regimes as changes in climate."

Here, we show that the provision of a single glycan, chitin, is critical for the maintenance of a symbiotic relationship between a squid and its luminescent bacterium. We also show that the glycan is provided only at night, and that the glycan catabolism is required for the maintenance of the symbiont population and the periodic acidification of the symbiont habitat. These results suggest that the timing and nature of nutrient provision may be a general feature of symbiosis. This may be a mechanism by which animals can control the activities of their symbionts. Such control may be important for the health of the host and the symbiont. (Read more)"

This epidemic marked the start of the second plague pandemic, which lasted in Europe until the early 19th century. This pandemic is generally understood as the consequence of a singular introduction of Yersinia pestis, after which the disease established itself in European rodents over four centuries. To locate these putative plague reservoirs, we studied the climate fluctuations that preceded regional plague epidemics, based on a dataset of 7,711 georeferenced historical plague outbreaks and 15 annually resolved tree-ring records from Europe and Asia. We provide evidence for repeated climate-driven reintroductions of the bacterium into European harbors from reservoirs in Asia, with a delay of 15 ± 1 y. Our analysis finds no support for the existence of permanent plague reservoirs in medieval Europe. These results provide a new perspective on the history of the plague pandemic and its impact on human history. (Abridged)"

There is an urgent need for novel and more efficient therapies, ideally targeting AML stem cells that are essential for maintaining the disease. We show here that monoclonal antibodies targeting the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML.

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation. These results demonstrate that the translation and base-pairing functions compete. These findings provide insight into the regulation of carbon utilization in bacteria. They also demonstrate that the translation and base-pairing functions compete in the same ribosome. This is an"

Here we show that the spread of aggregates in a Drosophila model of Huntington’s disease is dependent on the internalization of aggregates, which is in turn dependent on endocytosis. We also show that the release of aggregates requires fusion protein 1, demonstrating that active release and uptake of aggregates are important elements of spreading and disease progression. These results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the spread of aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies. (Show more)"

MTX inhibits the antiviral immune response of the host and facilitates viral infection. This study provides deeper insight into immunologically privileged sites for microbial community residence in bats and supports the therapeutic potential of targeting MTX-LTA4H.

We observe that the inclusion bodies in ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

This work provides important mechanistic insights into transcriptional stalling, lesion bypass, and mutagenesis of alkylated DNA lesions.

These findings provide a molecular mechanism for the role of STING in the regulation of insulin secretion and establish pathophysiological significance of fine-tuned STING within β-cells and insulin target tissues for maintaining glucose homeostasis.

Their genome is segmented into eight fragments, which complicates genomic packaging. The existence of a selective packaging mechanism, in which one copy of each viral RNA is specifically packaged into each virion, is suspected, but its molecular details remain unknown. Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus. We show that this interaction takes place in infected cells and is required for optimal viral replication. Disruption of this interaction nonspecifically decreases the amount of viral RNA in the viral particles, resulting in an eightfold increase in empty viral particles. This interaction is not widely conserved among influenza A virus, which might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses. Our results provide insights into the molecular details of the selective packaging mechanism of influenza A virus. They also provide a basis for the development of antiviral strategies. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that the flowering signal FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) is required for the flowering of the host and the parasite. This finding illustrates the importance of FTs as an important interplant flowering signal. The unique means of flowering regulation of dodder illustrates how regressive evolution, commonly found in parasites, may facilitate the physiological synchronization of parasite and host, here allowing the C. australis parasite to time reproduction exactly with that of their hosts, likely optimizing parasite fitness. This study provides a unique example of the evolution of flowering regulation in plants."

We show that the dopamine-containing system of the brain is highly integrated, with striosomes receiving input from cortical regions related to mood and motivation and linking functionally to reinforcement and decision-making. We also show that the dopamine-containing system of the brain is highly complex, with striatonigral fibers originating in striosomes forming highly unusual bouquet-like arborizations that target bundles of ventrally extending dopamine-containing dendrites and clusters of their parent nigral cell bodies. These clustered cell bodies in turn project to the striatum as part of the classic nigrostriatal pathway. Thus, the striosome–dendron bouquets likely represent subsystems with the nigro–striato–nigral loop that are affected in human disorders including Parkinson’s disease. Given evidence that striosomes receive input from cortical regions related to mood and motivation and link functionally to reinforcement and decision-making, the striosome–dendron bouquets could be critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease.

We asked people to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. We found that the speed with which people responded to each other predicted how connected they felt. Within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.” This is a fundamental property of social connection."

We demonstrate that this mechanism is sensitive to context and serial order which makes it suitable for temporal integration in sequence processing within the language domain.

This is due to the cell wall, which is absent in mammalian cells and poses the dominant physical barrier to biomolecule delivery in plants. Herein, we report a systematic assessment of different DNA nanostructures for their ability to internalize into cells of mature plants, deliver siRNAs, and effectively silence a constitutively expressed gene in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. We show that nanostructure internalization into plant cells and corresponding gene silencing efficiency depends on the DNA nanostructure size, shape, compactness, stiffness, and location of the siRNA attachment locus on the nanostructure. We further confirm that the internalization efficiency of DNA nanostructures correlates with their respective gene silencing efficiencies but that the endogenous gene silencing pathway depends on the siRNA attachment locus. Our work establishes the feasibility of biomolecule delivery to plants with DNA nanostructures and both details the design parameters of importance for plant cell internalization and also assesses the impact of DNA nanostructure geometry for gene silencing mechanisms. This work is a significant step forward in the development of DNA nanostructures as a tool for plant biology."

Nevertheless, most plantations were already deforested by 2015, and certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation.

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the discovery of a new species of sauro"
