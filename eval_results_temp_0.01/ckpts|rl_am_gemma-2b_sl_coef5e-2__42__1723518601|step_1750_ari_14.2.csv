However, the structure of hydrate with guest molecules is still poorly understood. Here, we report the structure of neon hydrate at high pressure and temperature. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The structure of neon hydrate is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. This work provides a new insight into the structure of hydrate with guest molecules. It also provides a reference for the structure of hydrate with other guest molecules. This work is expected to be of great significance for the development of hydrate-based technologies.

Although the evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we report the results of a comparative analysis of the genomes of two distantly related species of myxozoans and a cnidarian parasite. Our results show that the myxozoan body plan is reduced to a minimum, and that the genome is one of the smallest reported in animals. This suggests that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content.

The virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, is able to evade the host immune response by blocking the nuclear import of IFN-stimulated genes. In this study, we identified a viral protein, Orf6, that is able to block nuclear import of IFN-stimulated genes. We found that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and interacts with Nup98-Rae1, a protein complex that is involved in nuclear import. We show that Orf6 binding to Nup98-Rae1 disrupts the docking of the karyopherin/importin complex and prevents the import of IFN-stimulated genes. Our findings provide a mechanism of viral antagonism that could be used to design new antiviral strategies. (Less)"

Zinc is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. Sperm cells are quiescent in the male reproductive system due to Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels, but become active once introduced into the low-Zn2+-concentration environment of the female reproductive tract. How Zn2+ inhibits proton channels is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some proton channel residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each proton channel subunit. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

This increase in variability will increase the probability of simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year in the top four maize-exporting countries, which account for 87% of global maize exports.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level differences in diet. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species of large herbivores in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of species matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages, and that herbivore diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This work provides a framework for understanding the role of niche partitioning in structuring large herbivore assemblages. It also provides a proof of concept for the application of DNA metabarcoding to the study of diet. This approach will be critical for understanding the role of niche partitioning in structuring large herbivore assemblages in other ecosystems."

However, the magnitude of the problem is still unknown. We show that the global load of plastic debris on the open ocean surface is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected.

This problem can be addressed by the development of new antibacterial agents to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. In this study, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. This study provides a proof of concept for the use of computational predictions in the drug development process. The results of this study are of great importance for the development of new antibiotics. View Full-Text"

However, the number of trainable parameters in these networks is often large, and the number of parameters required to achieve accurate results is often large. Here, we introduce a network architecture based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters, and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data."

Here, we report a novel role for APOE in regulating the rate of astrocytic phagocytosis of synapses, which is highly dependent on APOE isoform.

This study shows that the evolution of an aquatic lifestyle is driving three of the four extant aquatic mammal clades toward a size attractor at ∼500 kg. The existence of this body size attractor and the relatively rapid selection toward, and limited deviation from, this attractor rule out most hypothesized drivers of size increase. These three independent body size increases and a shared aquatic optimum size are consistent with control by differences in the scaling of energetic intake and cost functions with body size between the terrestrial and aquatic realms. Under this energetic model, thermoregulatory costs constrain minimum size, whereas limitations on feeding efficiency constrain maximum size. The optimum size occurs at an intermediate value where thermoregulatory costs are low but feeding efficiency remains high. Rather than being released from size pressures, water-dwelling mammals are driven and confined to larger body sizes by the strict energetic demands of the aquatic medium. (Abridged)"

This correlates with higher expression levels of type I and type III IFN genes and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) at 37 °C.

However, the cellular concentration of Np4 increases in response to conditions of disulfide stress, and the predominant decapping enzyme in proteobacteria, ApaH, is inactivated by those conditions. Here, we show that, in cells experiencing disulfide stress, the pyrophosphohydrolase RppH, which is known to decapturate Np4-capped RNAs, is also capable of decapping those transcripts. Unexpectedly, RppH prefers to decapturate capped RNAs over their capped counterparts, and the unique manner in which capped substrates bind to the active site of RppH positions the δ-phosphate, rather than the β-phosphate, for hydrolytic attack, generating triphosphorylated RNA as the primary product of decapping. This work provides a mechanistic explanation for the differential impact of Np4 on the rates at which capped and uncapped 5′ ends are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation. The implications of this work for the regulation of gene expression during disulfide stress are discussed. (Read more)"

They are also the main targets of drugs. Ion channels are open or closed, and the open probability is determined by the channel conformation. Ion channels have two types of gates, one for fast activation/deactivation and the other for slow inactivation. We found that the BK channel, which is a large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel, has no classic activation gate and shows no C-type inactivation. We also found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. This study provides a new perspective on the regulation of ion channels. (Less)"

One of the most important steps in the parasite’s life cycle is the invasion of the red blood cell, which is the target of the parasite’s infection. Here, we show that the parasite’s erythrocyte-binding antigen, EBA175, alters the biophysical properties of the red blood cell membrane, reducing the energy barrier to invasion. This finding suggests that the parasite primes the erythrocyte surface through its binding antigens, altering the biophysical nature of the target cell and thus reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion. This would constitute a major change in our concept of malaria parasite invasion, suggesting it is, in fact, a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces working together to facilitate entry. This work provides a new perspective on the invasion process and could lead to the development of new strategies for malaria control. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

In the temperate regions, seasonal influenza virus outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in humidity. While low ambient humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings have implications for the development of strategies to mitigate the impact of influenza virus infection in low humidity environments. This article is protected by copyright.

This provides evidence for a merge operation that applies equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity. More superficial models of language, based on sequential transition probabilities, only captured activity in the posterior middle temporal gyrus. Our results suggest that the brain implements a bottom-up or left-corner parser of the incoming language stream.

The auditory organs of these animals are extremely diverse in anatomy after hundreds of millions of years of evolution, yet they are all made up of cellular tissue and are morphologically part of the body of the animal. Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is outsourced to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. We find that the orb web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to sense the motion of web threads that approaches the maximum physical efficiency better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself. The outsourcing and supersizing of auditory function in spiders provides unique features for studying extended and regenerative sensing and designing novel acoustic flow detectors for precise fluid dynamic measurement and manipulation.

This process is essential for the faithful replication of the lagging strand template and is integral to the maintenance of genome stability. However, the stability of the human pol δ holoenzyme has not been determined. Here, we report a unique kinetic assay that allows us to measure the processivity and stability of the human pol δ holoenzyme. Our results indicate that the human pol δ holoenzyme is not as stable as the S. cerevisiae pol δ holoenzyme and that the human pol δ holoenzyme is not as processive as the S. cerevisiae pol δ holoenzyme.

In the hypothesized RNA world, before the evolution of proteins, genetic information was stored in RNA molecules that were replicated by ribozymes. In the laboratory, RNA molecules can be replicated by ribozymes, but the process is inefficient. Here, we describe a method for improving the activity of ribozymes that can be used to increase the efficiency of RNA replication in the laboratory. The improved ribozyme can replicate RNA molecules, amplify RNA templates, and synthesize a variety of functional RNA molecules, including aptamers, ribozymes, and tRNA. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins."

First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

We introduce a method to identify topics in a corpus and represent documents as topic sequences. We use a sparse representation of an embedding space to identify a set of latent topics that can be interpreted as latent topics. We can also infer the topic that generated a sequence of words. We illustrate our method with a prominent example of underutilized text: the US National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). The NVDRS summarizes violent death incidents with structured variables and unstructured narratives. We identify 225 latent topics in the narratives (e.g., preparation for death and physical aggression); many of these topics are not captured by existing structured variables. Motivated by known patterns in suicide and homicide by gender and recent research on gender biases in semantic space, we identify the gender bias of our topics (e.g., a topic about pain medication is feminine). We then compare the gender bias of topics to their prevalence in narratives of female versus male victims. Results provide a detailed quantitative picture of reporting about lethal violence and its gendered nature. Our method offers a flexible and broadly applicable approach to model topics in text data."

This epidemic marked the start of the second plague pandemic, which lasted in Europe until the early 19th century. This pandemic is generally understood as the consequence of a singular introduction of Yersinia pestis, after which the disease established itself in European rodents over four centuries. To locate these putative plague reservoirs, we studied the climate fluctuations that preceded regional plague epidemics, based on a dataset of 7,711 georeferenced historical plague outbreaks and 15 annually resolved tree-ring records from Europe and Asia. We provide evidence for repeated climate-driven reintroductions of the bacterium into European harbors from reservoirs in Asia, with a delay of 15 ± 1 y. Our analysis finds no support for the existence of permanent plague reservoirs in medieval Europe.

We show that monoclonal antibodies targeting interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. View Full-Text"

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA. Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete. This work provides insight into the regulation of carbon utilization in bacteria. It also"

In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

This effect is rooted in defective glycine import, and thus defective glycine metabolism, in these cancer cells. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of cancer cells."

Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions in the brain and spinal cord of ALS patients are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. To explain the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in ALS, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. Our findings may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for ALS. (PsycINFO Database Record"

An optical conveyor technique is presented for continuously loading atoms into the desired trapping positions with optimal coupling to the photonic crystal. The device configuration also enables application of optical tweezers for controlled placement of atoms. Devices can be fabricated reliably from a 200-nm silicon nitride device layer using a lithography-based process, producing predicted optical properties in transmission and reflection measurements.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. We determined how sequential proteolysis contributes to MERS-CoV infection by introducing mutations that blocked the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses trafficked past endosomal fusion-activating proteases into endosomes, whereas precleaved viruses used surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry. Uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Therefore, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that"

In this study, we demonstrate that the activation of Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) is a critical event in the disturbed flow-induced activation of proatherosclerotic phenotypes of vascular endothelial cells. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of the role of YAP/TAZ in the development of atherosclerotic lesions and suggest that inhibition of YAP/TAZ activation is a promising athero-protective therapeutic strategy. This study also provides a rationale for the use of statin, an antiatherosclerotic drug, in the treatment of atherosclerosis. (PsycINFO Database Record"

However, in recent decades, the economic and ecological costs of wildfire have risen substantially. Climate change has likely contributed to the increase in wildfire activity, but the direct role of people in increasing wildfire activity has been largely overlooked. We show that humans have vastly expanded the spatial and seasonal “fire niche” in the United States, accounting for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. Human-caused wildfires disproportionally occurred where fuel moisture was higher than lightning-started fires, thereby helping expand the geographic and seasonal niche of wildfire. Actions to raise awareness and increase management in regions prone to human-started wildfires should be a focus of United States policy to reduce fire risk and associated hazards."

We connect changes in the physical appearance of five US cities with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities. Our work also provides a proof of concept for a new approach to urban monitoring that can be applied to other cities and other types of data."

Here we present a mathematical model of ZIKV dynamics in a nonhuman primate model, allowing for characterization of the growth and clearance of ZIKV within individual macaques. We estimate that the eclipse phase for ZIKV, the time between cell infection and viral production, is most likely short (∼4 h), the median within-host basic reproductive number R0 is 10.7, the rate of viral production is rapid (&gt;25,000 virions d−1), and the lifetime of an infected cell while producing virus is ∼5 h. We also estimate that the minimum number of virions produced by an infected cell over its lifetime is ∼5,500. Finally, we assess the potential effect of an antiviral treatment that blocks viral replication, showing that the median time to undetectable plasma viral load can be reduced from ∼5 d to ∼3 d with a drug concentration ∼15 times the drug"

Our results suggest that Si may be used as a biocontrol agent to protect rice from insect attack. This study also provides a framework for the development of Si-based biocontrol strategies for other crops. (Abridged)"
