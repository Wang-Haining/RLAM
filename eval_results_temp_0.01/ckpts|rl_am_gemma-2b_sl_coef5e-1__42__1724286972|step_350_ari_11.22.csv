However, the structure of hydrate is still controversial. In this work, we report the structure of neon hydrate at high pressure and temperature. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The structure of neon hydrate is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. Our results provide a new insight into the structure of hydrate. This article is protected by copyright.

However, its foundations have been a source of controversy for more than a century. In this paper, we provide a purely categorical approach to quantum theory. Our approach is based on a set of axioms that guarantee that a category is equivalent to that of continuous linear functions between Hilbert spaces. This approach addresses a question about the foundations of quantum theory raised in reconstruction programs such as those of von Neumann, Mackey, Jauch, Piron, Abramsky, and Coecke. Our results also have implications for the foundations of functional analysis."

The evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, and a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we present evidence that the Myxozoa are a sister taxon to the cnidarian parasite Polypodium hydriforme. We also show that the Myxozoa have one of the smallest animal genomes reported to date. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This article is protected by copyright.

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to block nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are essential for induction of IFN-stimulated genes. We found that the viral accessory protein Orf6 is responsible for this activity. We show that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1. We also show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its ability to block nuclear import of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex. Our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

This study quantifies the magnitude of this increase and its consequences for global maize production. We find that the coefficient of variation of maize yields will increase to values much larger than present-day values in most major maize-producing countries. This increase is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and to a decrease in mean yields. The probability that the top four maize-exporting countries have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes.

This is partly because we lack a comprehensive understanding of how herbivores partition food resources. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammalian herbivores in semiarid African savanna. Our results show that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These findings suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages. Our results also highlight the importance of species-level diet characterization in studies of herbivore ecology. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The development of new antibiotics is urgently needed. Here, we present a rational design approach to identify new antibiotics. We use computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome to screen a library of acylide antibiotics. We show that the best candidate is more active than telithromycin, a clinically used antibiotic, and is up to 56 times more active against resistant pathogens than telithromycin. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

We observe dramatic shifts in effective moisture, resulting in large-scale changes in one of the world’s largest lakes and most diverse freshwater ecosystems. We show evidence for 24 lake level drops of more than 200 m during the Late Quaternary, including 15 lowstands when water levels were more than 400 m lower than modern. A dramatic shift is observed at the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT), consistent with far-field climate forcing, which separates vastly different hydroclimate regimes before and after ∼800,000 years ago. We show that periods of high lake level are observed during times of high eccentricity. The extreme hydroclimate variability exerted a profound influence on the Lake Malawi endemic cichlid fish species flock; the geographically extensive habitat reconfiguration provided novel ecological opportunities"

The HSRL is capable of measuring aerosol and cloud properties with high spatial and temporal resolution. We use this instrument to investigate the ACI over Beijing. The results show that aerosol loading has no discernible effect on the liquid water path but increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius. This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation.

The isotopic record of the oceans, however, has been subject to question. Here we use the thermostability of reconstructed ancestral enzymes to determine the temperature history of the surface environment of the early Earth. Our results suggest that Earth’s surface temperature decreased over geological time from ∼65–80 °C in the Archean. This finding is consistent with both isotopic and protein reconstruction-based interpretations. Our study demonstrates the utility of integrating genomic, geologic, and paleontologic data to provide new insights into the origin of life. This article is protected by copyright.

Ion channels are also important for drug delivery and gene therapy. Ion channels are regulated by multiple mechanisms, including activation/deactivation gates and inactivation gates. Activation/deactivation gates are commonly located at the intracellular end of the channel. Inactivation gates are commonly located at the selectivity filter. We found that the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel lacks an intracellular activation gate and shows no C-type inactivation. We also found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Our findings may help us understand the BK channel’s normal closing and may also help us understand the BK channel’s role in disease. Copyright © 2016. Published by Elsevier Inc."

However, the human pol δ holoenzyme is unstable and dissociates rapidly. Here, we show that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This study provides a unique insight into the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme and its implications for DNA replication. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

In the hypothesized RNA world, before the evolution of proteins, genetic information was stored in RNA molecules. In the laboratory, RNA molecules can replicate themselves, but the evolution of a protein-free RNA polymerase is not known. Here, we use in vitro evolution to improve an RNA polymerase ribozyme, which can synthesize RNA from an RNA template. The improved polymerase ribozyme can synthesize a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and, in low yield, even tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase ribozyme can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins. This work provides a foundation for the evolution of life without proteins. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

However, the mechanisms of urban change are not well understood. In this paper, we introduce a computer vision method to measure changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods from time-series street-level imagery. We connect changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods with economic and demographic data and find that three factors predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

We demonstrate that the antifreeze glycoprotein binds the terminal d-alanine residue of the peptidoglycan cell wall of gut bacteria, resulting in altered permeability and the capacity of bacteria to form biofilms. These data elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which a human pathogen appropriates an arthropod antibacterial protein to alter the gut microbiota and more effectively colonize the vector.

We show that Jinguofortisids, a group that includes the enigmatic Chongmingia, represent the second earliest diverging group of the Pygostylia. The discovery of Jinguofortis increases our understanding of the mosaic evolution of the avian tail. The presence of a fused scapulocoracoid in adult individuals independently evolved in Jinguofortisidae and Confuciusornithiformes may relate to an accelerated osteogenesis during chondrogenesis. The discovery of Jinguofortis also highlights the importance of developmental plasticity for understanding mosaic evolution in early birds. This article is protected by copyright.

However, the mechanisms by which hypoxia promotes breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) phenotype and tumorigenicity are not well understood. We show that hypoxia induces expression of AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), which demethylates NANOG mRNA at an m6A residue. ALKBH5 expression is induced by hypoxia via the hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1α and HIF-2α. NANOG mRNA levels are increased in a HIF- and ALKBH5-dependent manner, and ALKBH5 overexpression increases the percentage of BCSCs. Thus, ALKBH5 expression is induced by hypoxia, and promotes BCSC phenotype and tumorigenicity. Our findings may help to explain the role of hypoxia in the initiation of breast cancer.

However, the mechanisms by which this is achieved are poorly understood. Here, we show that the squid Euprymna scolopes regulates the activities of its luminescent symbionts through the strategic provision of a single glycan. This glycan is synthesized by the host and delivered to the symbiotic crypts only at night. The catabolism of this glycan by the symbionts is required for their survival and for a periodic acidification of the crypts. We propose that this glycan-mediated regulation of symbiont activity is a general mechanism used by animals to maintain the health of their tissues. This article is protected by copyright.

The majority of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria use a [4Fe-4S] cluster protein, whereas plants and cyanobacteria possess a diiron protein. Plant and cyanobacterial mutants in the genes encoding the enzymes catalyzing the formation of the fifth ring display impaired function. Here, we show that the diiron protein from Rubrivivax gelatinosus is the cyclase in oxygenic phototrophs, and that different classes of the enzyme exist based on their requirement for an additional subunit.

We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

The disease is caused by mutations in multiple genes, and the pathological hallmark is the formation of intracellular inclusions. These inclusions contain a variety of proteins that are not normally found in the same cellular compartment. We show that the proteins that form inclusions in ALS are supersaturated in motor neurons, but not in other tissues. This suggests that the inclusions are the result of a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. Our results provide a new perspective on the pathogenesis of ALS. They also suggest that the inclusion bodies in other neurodegenerative diseases may be the result of a set of proteins that are metastable in the diseased state. This may have implications for the development of therapeutic strategies. (Read more)"

The photonic crystal band structures are predicted to produce unconventional atom–light interaction behaviors, including anisotropic emission, suppressed spontaneous decay, and photon-mediated atom–atom interactions controlled by the position of the atomic array relative to the photonic crystal. The device configuration also enables application of optical tweezers for controlled placement of atoms. Devices can be fabricated reliably from a 200-nm silicon nitride device layer using a lithography-based process, producing predicted optical properties in transmission and reflection measurements. These 2D photonic crystal devices can be readily deployed to experiments for many-body physics with neutral atoms and engineering of exotic quantum matter.

Some have proposed that the origin of the flowering plants was in a darkened forest habitat, while others have proposed an aquatic habitat. The research presented here centers on Montsechia vidalii, a plant first recovered from lithographic limestone deposits in the Pyrenees of Spain more than 100 y ago. Montsechia has been poorly understood and misinterpreted in the past. Now, based upon the study of more than 1,000 carefully prepared specimens, a detailed analysis of Montsechia is presented. The morphology and anatomy of the plant, including aspects of its reproduction, suggest that Montsechia is sister to Ceratophyllum (whenever cladistic analyses are made with or without a backbone). Montsechia was an aquatic angiosperm living and reproducing below the surface of the water, similar to Ceratophyllum. Montsechia is Barremian in age, raising questions about the very early divergence of the Ceratophyllum clade compared with its position as sister to eudicots in many cladistic analyses. Lower Cretaceous aquatic angiosperms, such as Archaefructus and Montsechia, open the possibility that aquatic plants"

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into endosomes. Uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases.

In this paper, we introduce a computer vision method to measure changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods from time-series street-level imagery. We connect changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods with economic and demographic data and find that three factors predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

We asked people to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. We found that the speed at which people responded to each other predicted how connected they felt. People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

STIM1 is selectively expressed in SAN cells and is required for maintaining normal SAN function. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized role for STIM1 in SAN function and suggest that targeting STIM1 may be a promising therapeutic strategy for treating heart failure.

It is also a highly flexible skill that can be used in a variety of contexts. Here we propose a computational model of language processing that is based on the idea that information is stored in the form of adaptive changes in neuronal excitability. This mechanism is sensitive to context and serial order which makes it suitable for temporal integration in sequence processing within the language domain. Our model provides a neurobiological substrate for the binding of linguistic features over time. This work provides a step toward a computational neurobiology of language.

Here we show that NMDAR-Ab encephalitis causes changes in the intrinsic microcircuitry of the cortex that can lead to paroxysmal EEG abnormalities. We use a dynamic model of the cortex to explain the key synaptic parameters that best explain the paroxysmal EEG abnormalities in patients. We then show that these same parameters can cause overt paroxysmal EEG abnormalities in a mouse model of the disease. These findings offer mechanistic insights into circuit-level dysfunction induced by NMDAR-Ab. They also suggest that the same parameters that cause paroxysmal EEG abnormalities may be tolerated in the absence of overt paroxysms. This may explain why some patients do not have paroxysmal EEG abnormalities. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants.
