In this work, we demonstrate that neon atoms can be enclathrated in water molecules to form ice II-structured hydrates. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The resolved structure where Ne dissolved in ice II is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. The density distributions indicate that the vibration of Ne atoms is mainly in planes perpendicular to D2O channels, whereas their distributions along the channels are further constrained by interactions between adjacent Ne atoms. The results provide insights into the formation of hydrates and the role of guest molecules in the stability of hydrate structures. They also provide a new route to the synthesis of hydrates with desired compositions and structures. This work is expected to be of interest to the scientific community interested in the structure and stability of hydrates."

Here, we present the first comparative analysis of the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species and compare these to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content.

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1, but the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels. This study also provides a useful example of how to use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to study the molecular mechanism of channel inhibition."

We show that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields will increase to values much larger than present-day values in the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields. For the top four maize-exporting countries, which account for 87% of global maize exports, the probability that they have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. They also underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance."

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is largely unknown because comprehensive species-level identification is prohibitively difficult with traditional methods. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammalian herbivores in semiarid African savanna. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers. Grass consumption inferred from DNA sequence relative read abundance ranged from &gt;99% (plains zebra) to &lt;1% (dik-dik). Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This study highlights the need for more comprehensive and taxon-specific studies of diet partitioning in nature."

However, the global load of plastic debris on the open ocean surface was estimated to be on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This discrepancy is explained by the size distribution of the debris, which points at important size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

In this study, we examine the factors that increase reproductive output and the strength of the effect of these factors across a wide range of species. We find that the most important factor is the amount of energy available to the mother. This energy can come from the mother herself (allocare) or from the offspring (allonursing). Domestication also increases the amount of energy available to the mother, but the effect is smaller than that of allocare and allonursing. These results suggest that the most important factor limiting reproductive output in placental mammals is maternal metabolic power rather than resource availability. This finding has implications for the evolution of reproductive strategies in nature and the domestication process. It also suggests that the reproductive output of a species is a good indicator of its metabolic power."

We present here an in vivo proof of concept of the ability of the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 to mitigate α-syn pathology and to mediate neuroprotection in a mouse model of MSA. VX-765 prevented motor deficits in the mouse model and reduced α-syn load in the striatum of the mouse model.

A Threonine to Alanine substitution at this position was studied in three representative members of the K+-channel family. Interestingly, all of the mutant channels exhibited lack of C-type inactivation gating and an inversion of their allosteric coupling (i.e., closing of the activation gate collapses the channel’s selectivity filter). A state-dependent crystallographic study of KcsA-T75A proves that, on activation, the selectivity filter transitions from a nonconductive and deep C-type inactivated conformation to a conductive one.

Within the structures, different materials play distinct roles yet seamlessly collaborate through sophisticated deformation mechanisms to produce the target behaviors. The synthesized structures are effectively manufactured via multimaterial fabrication with different polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomers with distinct behaviors and their highly nonlinear responses are physically and accurately realized in experiments. To enhance programmability, the synthesized structures are heteroassembled into architectures that exhibit highly complex yet navigable responses. The proposed synthesis, multimaterial fabrication, and heteroassembly strategy can be utilized to design function-oriented and situation-specific mechanical devices for a wide range of applications.

Here we investigated the role of the insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) in the heterochronous regulation of hemoglobin expression in human erythroid tissues. We show that IGF2BP1 is expressed in the fetal liver and is down-regulated in the adult bone marrow. In addition, we show that IGF2BP1 can reverse the adult hemoglobin pattern in primary human erythroid tissues. This reversal is mediated by reduced protein expression of the transcription factor BCL11A, which is a key regulator of fetal hemoglobin expression. These results suggest a mechanism for chronoregulation of fetal and adult hemoglobin expression in humans. This knowledge may be useful for the development of therapeutic strategies for hemoglobinopathies. It may also be relevant to the understanding of the evolution of the hemoglobin system."

It is regulated by cellular metabolism, redox homeostasis, and various signaling pathways related to cancer. In this study, we found that activating mutation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), highly frequent events in human cancer, confers ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells, and that inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis induction. Mechanistically, this resistance requires sustained activation of mTORC1 and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)C1-dependent induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. Furthermore, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a transcriptional target of SREBP1, mediates the ferroptosis-suppressing activity of SREBP1 by producing monounsaturated fatty acids.

Phylogenomic analyses of these uniquely comprehensive datasets resolved controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, plant cell wall-degrading enzymes obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, both major independent origins of specialized herbivory in beetles coincide with the first appearances of an arsenal of PCWDEs encoded in their genomes. Beetle diversity thus appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding PCWDEs.

The only available vaccines are not 100% effective, and the pandemic is far from being under control. Therefore, the development of a highly effective, safe, and broadly protective vaccine is a global priority. Here, we describe a live attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that is highly attenuated, induces strong immune responses, and protects against lethal challenge with the wild-type virus. This vaccine has the potential to be used in mass vaccination programs to control the pandemic. The vaccine is temperature sensitive in vitro, but grows robustly at the permissive temperature, ensuring large-scale manufacturing. The vaccine is also easy to manufacture at large scale, which is essential for mass vaccination programs. These features, coupled with the fact that the vaccine is based on a segment of the viral spike protein, which engages with the host immune system, make this vaccine a promising candidate for use in mass vaccination programs."

The vector of plague during this period is still debated. Here, we show that a model for plague transmission by a human ectoparasite vector fits mortality curves from nine outbreaks in Europe better than models for rodent or pneumonic transmission. Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346–1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats. This study also highlights the importance of using Bayesian inference to model mortality data. Our results suggest that the Black Death was not a single epidemic but rather a series of recurrent epidemics, which may have had a significant impact on the history of Europe. This study also shows that the use of Bayesian inference can help to identify the most appropriate models for mortality data. This is an important contribution to the field of epidemiology and public health. It also has implications for the history of Europe and the role of human ectoparasites in the spread of disease."

However, current inhibitors cannot distinguish between TRAP1 and HSP90, the target of many existing drugs. We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor.

They are dynamic polymers that can be assembled and disassembled. The actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin family is the major regulator of actin filament disassembly. It is unclear how ADF/cofilin disassembles filaments in a physiological context, where filaments are interconnected and under mechanical stress. Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques, coupled to microfluidics, to monitor and quantify the action of ADF/cofilin in different mechanical situations. We find that local curvature favors severing, while tension has no effect on cofilin binding and weakly enhances severing. Remarkably, we observe that filament segments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist, experience a mechanical torque upon cofilin binding. We propose that this ADF/cofilin-induced torque increases the severing rate constant 100-fold. A consequence of this mechanism is that cross-linked filament networks are severed by cofilin far more efficiently than nonconnected filaments. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells"

The recent demographic history of Madagascar is revealed by the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island. The settlement history of Madagascar is complex, with a recent settlement from Africa and Asia, but also a long history of admixture, which is still detectable in the present-day genomic diversity.

However, the mechanism by which this capping is removed is not well understood.

This preference is driven by a unique mechanism in which the δ-phosphate, rather than the β-phosphate, is the nucleophile in the catalytic reaction. The unusual manner in which Np4-capped RNA binds to the active site of RppH positions the δ-phosphate for attack by the enzyme, generating triphosphorylated RNA as the primary product of decapping. This work provides insight into the mechanisms by which bacteria can rapidly adapt to stress by altering the levels of RNA molecules.

We found that citrulline, an amino acid that is converted to arginine in the body, was more efficient than arginine in increasing arginine plasma levels and restoring T cell mitochondrial function and proliferation while reducing immunosuppression. Because there is no specific therapeutic strategy to restore immune function after sepsis, we believe that our study provides evidence for developing citrulline-based clinical studies in sepsis.

We here present thermostability measurements of ancestral enzymes derived from light-requiring prokaryotic and eukaryotic phototrophs having widely separated fossil-based divergence ages. The ancestral environmental temperatures thereby determined for these photic-zone organisms––shown in modern taxa to correlate strongly with thermostability––are inferred to reflect ancient surface-environment paleotemperatures.

In temperate regions, seasonal influenza outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in ambient humidity. While low humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear.

We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

This pattern of activity is consistent with a bottom-up parser that merges words into phrases, and it is also consistent with a model of language in which the brain uses the probability of a word given the previous word as its only cue. Our results suggest that the brain uses probability as a heuristic to build syntactic structures. This heuristic may be useful in noisy environments, when the brain is unable to access the full context of a word.

Vaccine access is a critical challenge, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. We report the design and synthesis of a variant of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein that is well-suited for large-scale production. This variant exhibits enhanced immunogenicity and cross-reactivity with variants of concern, and can be presented on a virus-like particle. These properties make it a promising candidate for a global vaccine. This engineered RBD can be produced in large quantities at low cost, and can be used to rapidly develop a vaccine that can be deployed globally."

The earliest Y. pestis genomes recovered from the Neolithic period have revealed key evolutionary steps that led to its emergence from a Yersinia pseudotuberculosis-like progenitor. However, the number of reconstructed genomes is too few to explore its diversity during this critical period of development. Here, we present 17 Y. pestis genomes dating to 5,000 to 2,500 y BP from a wide geographic expanse across Eurasia. This increased dataset enabled us to explore correlations between temporal, geographical, and genetic distance. Our results suggest a nonflea-adapted and potentially extinct single lineage that persisted over millennia without significant parallel diversification, accompanied by rapid dispersal across continents throughout this period, a trend not observed in other pathogens for which ancient genomes are available. Together, these data reveal the dynamic nature of plague’s formative years in terms of its early evolution and ecology. This work also reveals the presence of the flea-adapted form of Y. pestis in Bronze Age Iberia, previously only identified in in the Caucasus and the Volga regions, suggesting a much wider geographic spread of this form"

This heterogeneity is particularly striking in women with artificial skull deformations, who appear to have originated in southeastern Europe. In addition, we find that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how HKU4 and HKU5 transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. First, whereas MERS-CoV prefers human DPP4 over bat DPP4 as its receptor, HKU4 shows the opposite trend. Second, in the absence of exogenous proteases, both MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes mediate pseudovirus entry into bat cells, whereas only MERS-CoV spike, but not HKU4 spike, mediates pseudovirus entry into human cells.

Surprisingly, the results indicate that human pol δ maintains a loose association with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion.

In the hypothesized RNA world, before the evolution of proteins, genetic information was stored in RNA molecules that were replicated by ribozymes. In an effort toward reconstructing RNA-based life in the laboratory, in vitro evolution was used to improve dramatically the activity and generality of an RNA polymerase ribozyme by selecting variants that can synthesize functional RNA molecules from an RNA template. The improved polymerase ribozyme is able to synthesize a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and, in low yield, even tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins.

However, the origin of the modern avian body plan is obscured by the limited known diversity of early branching members of the clade Pygostylia (birds with a short tail ending in a compound bone termed “pygostyle”). Here, we describe a basal member of Pygostylia, Jinguofortis perplexus, that adds important information about the origin of the short-tailed bird group. The discovery of Jinguofortis increases the known ecomorphological diversity of basal pygostylians and highlights the importance of developmental plasticity for understanding mosaic evolution in early birds. This study also provides important new information about the origin of the flight apparatus and the evolution of mosaic evolution in birds. (Show more)"

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (denoted GlpD) and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

However, their assessments are subjective and qualitative, and are not easily amenable to quantitative analysis. We show how to convert the original crop expert assessments into a continuous probabilistic variable that can be used to monitor crop status and predict crop yields. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by showing that the Crop Condition Index derived from the crop expert assessments is more accurate than official forecasts released midseason. Our results show that crop experts are a valuable source of information that can be used to improve agricultural monitoring and forecasting systems. This approach can be extended to other crops and countries."

It is also one of the most challenging to model, as it involves the loss of a major function, photosynthesis, and the acquisition of a new function, the acquisition of nutrients. Here, we show that the transition to a parasitic lifestyle, characterized by the parasite’s dependence on a host to fulfill its life cycle, rather than the loss of photosynthesis, is linked to the relaxation of functional constraints on the plastid genome. Our findings suggest that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner. During the functional reduction process, the elevation of evolutionary rates reaches several new rate equilibria, possibly relating to the modified protein turnover rates in heterotrophic plastids. This stepwise relaxation of functional constraints may be a general feature of the transition from autotrophy to heterotrophy."

Neuroinflammation is also known to be associated with autoimmune diseases, such as EAE. Neuroinflammation is regulated by a variety of signaling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). However, the precise roles of these signaling pathways in neuroinflammation remain unclear. In this study, we found that apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is a key regulator of neuroinflammation in EAE. ASK1 is highly expressed in microglia/macrophages and plays a major role in the later stage of EAE. ASK1 deficiency in microglia/macrophages ameliorated the early stage of EAE, whereas deficiency in astrocytes ameliorated the later stage of EAE. These findings suggest that ASK1 in microglia/macrophages plays a major role in the early stage, whereas ASK1 in astrocytes plays a major role in the later stage of EAE.

The extremely warm and dry conditions have led to acute water shortages, groundwater overdraft, critically low streamflow, and enhanced wildfire risk. We show that the probability that precipitation deficits co-occur with warm conditions and the probability that precipitation deficits produce drought have both increased. We conclude that anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of co-occurring warm–dry conditions like those that have created the acute human and ecosystem impacts associated with the “exceptional” 2012–2014 drought in California.

The etiology of autism is so complicated because it involves the effects of variants of several hundred risk genes along with the contribution of environmental factors. Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. As an alternative approach, extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying the convergence of the targets and functions of the autism-risk genes to facilitate mapping out causal paths. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. Mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a molecular mechanism"

However, the factors that contribute to virus spillover from bats are not well understood. Here, we identified and characterized a protein (MTX) that is highly concentrated in the submandibular salivary gland of the bat, Myotis pilosus. MTX selectively inhibits the leukotriene-A4 hydrolase function of leukotriene-A4 hydrolase to inhibit leukotriene B4 (LTB4) generation, a potent lipid chemoattractant for host defense against infection. MTX potently inhibits proinflammatory proteases to induce immune tolerance and maintain high stability.

Here, we use NMR-assisted crystallography to characterize the structure of the tryptophan synthase α-aminoacrylate intermediate, a defining species for pyridoxal-5′-phosphate–dependent enzymes that catalyze β-elimination and replacement reactions. This integrated approach is able to provide atomic-resolution characterization of the protonation states of the ionizable sites on the cofactor, substrate, and catalytic side chains as well as the location and orientation of crystallographic waters within the active site. Most notable is the water molecule immediately adjacent to the substrate β-carbon, which serves as a hydrogen bond donor to the ε-amino group of the βLys87 catalytic residue. This detailed picture of structure and reactivity emerges, highlighting the fate of the L-serine hydroxyl leaving group and the reaction pathway back to the preceding transition state. Reaction of the α-aminoacrylate intermediate with benzimidazole, an isostere of the natural substrate indole, shows benzimidazole bound in the active site and poised for, but unable to initiate, the subsequent bond formation step.

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis remain unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We found that pol II stalling at O2-EtdT and N3-EtdT sites is exacerbated by TFIIS-stimulated proofreading activity. Assessment for the impact of the EtdT lesions on individual fidelity checkpoints provided mechanistic insights, where the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion. For the N3-EtdT lesion that disrupts base pairing, multiple transcriptional lesion bypass routes were found. Finally, we identified a"

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas the more rigid uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into"

We show that doubling the proportion of vegetarian meals available in a large catering setting increased the proportion of vegetarian meals purchased by 61% and decreased the proportion of meat meals purchased by 14%.

We find that each oncogene has somewhat different surfaceomes, but the functions of these proteins are harmonized by common biological themes including up-regulation of nutrient transporters, down-regulation of adhesion molecules and tumor suppressing phosphatases, and alteration in immune modulators. Addition of a potent MEK inhibitor that blocks MAPK signaling brings each oncogene-induced surfaceome back to a common state reflecting the strong dependence of the oncogene on the MAPK pathway to propagate signaling.

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive design-based analysis of the effect of universal vote-by-mail—a policy under which every voter is mailed a ballot in advance of the election—on electoral outcomes. We find that universal vote-by-mail does not appear to affect either party’s share of turnout, does not appear to increase either party’s vote share, and modestly increases overall average turnout rates, in line with previous estimates. All three conclusions support the conventional wisdom of election administration experts and contradict many popular claims in the media.

However, the molecular targets of natural repellents in arthropods remain to be elucidated. Here, we identified a scorpion transient receptor potential (sTRP1) channel that senses Cymbopogon-derived natural repellents, while remaining insensitive to the synthetic chemical pesticide DEET. We further demonstrated that dTRPγ ion channel in Drosophila melanogaster mediates avoidance behavior to natural repellents. This study sheds light on arthropod molecular targets of natural repellents, exemplifying the arthropod–plant adaptation.

The mechanisms of ZIKV pathogenesis are not fully understood, but the dynamics of ZIKV within the host are likely to play an important role. Here we present a mathematical analysis of the within-host dynamics of ZIKV in a nonhuman primate model, allowing for characterization of the growth and clearance of ZIKV within individual macaques. We show that the antiviral treatment favipiravir can reduce the time to undetectable plasma viral load by ∼2 d, whereas treatment given 2 d postinfection is mostly ineffective in accelerating plasma viral load loss. These results provide insights into the potential impact of antiviral treatment on the course of ZIKV infection. They also highlight the importance of early treatment initiation, which is difficult to achieve in humans due to the lack of a rapid diagnostic test. Our results suggest that the timing of treatment initiation may be critical for the efficacy of antiviral treatment against ZIKV.

The loss of the symbiosis is often used as a proxy for the health of coral reefs, but the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Here, we show that the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis is driven by altered nutrient cycling during heat stress. This shift from uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host. This study provides a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general. This work also provides a new perspective on the stability of the coral holobiont in light of its metabolic interactions."

The eruptions led to stratospheric ozone depletion, which plausibly linked the eruptions to the start of accelerated Southern Hemisphere deglaciation. This study provides a unique example of how volcanic eruptions can impact climate and the climate system, and how climate impacts can be linked to specific events. This is important for understanding the climate system and its response to external forcing. It also provides a unique example of how volcanic eruptions can be used to constrain climate history.

This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa.

We conducted a series of experiments to show that the speed with which we respond to others is a robust and sufficient signal of connection. We found that people felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. This signal is used by third-party listeners as a heuristic of how well people are connected. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

SAN cells (SANCs) are responsible for generating the heart rate, and their function is regulated by the internal Ca2+ store and the plasma membrane. Here, we report that stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is expressed in SANCs and plays a critical role in regulating SAN function. Cardiac-specific deletion of STIM1 in mice resulted in depletion of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ stores of SANCs and led to SAN dysfunction, as was evident by a reduction in heart rate, sinus arrest, and an exaggerated autonomic response to cholinergic signaling. Moreover, STIM1 influenced SAN function by regulating ionic fluxes in SANCs, including activation of a store-operated Ca2+ current, a reduction in L-type Ca2+ current, and enhancing the activities of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. These studies reveal that STIM1 is a multifunctional regulator of Ca2+ dynamics in SANCs that links SR Ca2+ store content with electrical events occurring in the plasma membrane, thereby contributing to automaticity of the SAN.

Our results reveal that small watersheds can be a significant source of nutrients to the nearshore zone, especially when they drain urbanized areas. This finding suggests that nutrient management efforts should focus on small watersheds, which are often overlooked in regulatory efforts and monitoring programs.

However, the effect of certification on deforestation in oil palm plantations remains unclear. Here, we use a comprehensive dataset of RSPO-certified and noncertified oil palm plantations (∼188,000 km2) in Indonesia, the leading producer of palm oil, as well as annual remotely sensed metrics of tree cover loss and fire occurrence, to evaluate the impact of certification on deforestation and fire. We find that certification reduced deforestation in Indonesia. Nevertheless, most plantations contained little residual forest when they received certification. As a result, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield"
