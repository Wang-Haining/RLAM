In this work, we report the structure of ice II-structured hydrate, which is a new phase of water. The structure of the hydrate is determined by in situ neutron diffraction at 480 MPa and temperatures ranging from 260 to 70 K. The guest atoms are enclathrated in the water molecules to form ice II-structured hydrates. The guest atoms are free to move in the hydrate structure, which is confirmed by molecular dynamics simulation. This work provides a new route to study the structure of ice II and opens up a new field of study on the structure of ice under high pressure. It also provides a new route to study the structure of ice under high pressure."

The definition is based on a set of axioms that are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. The axioms are similar to those of the category of sets and functions, but they are more general and allow for the possibility that the underlying set is not a set of states of a physical system. The definition of quantum theory is based on a category of Hilbert spaces and operators on them. The category is equivalent to the category of continuous linear operators on Hilbert spaces, but the former is more general. The definition of quantum theory is not based on the axiom of choice, and it is shown that the category of Hilbert spaces and operators on them is complete and cocomplete."

Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we report the first genomic and transcriptomic analyses of two myxozoans, Kudoa iwatai and Myxobolus cerebralis, and compare these to the transcriptome and genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results show that myxozoans are cnidarians and are a sister taxon to the model parasite P. hydriforme. In addition, our analyses reveal that myxozoans have one of the smallest reported animal genomes and that they have lost many genes involved in development and cell differentiation. These results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content."

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

This higher variability will increase the probability of simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year in the top four maize-exporting countries to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming.

However, the degree to which different species partition food resources is largely unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa in the field. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species of wild and domestic LMH in semiarid African savanna. We found that, despite being similar in size and digestive physiology, LMH consumed different plant species, and that dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results have implications for the management of LMH in African savanna and beyond."

Interestingly, all of the mutant channels exhibited lack of C-type inactivation gating and an inversion of their allosteric coupling (i.e., closing of the activation gate collapses the channel’s selectivity filter). A state-dependent crystallographic study of KcsA-T75A proves that, on activation, the selectivity filter transitions from a nonconductive and deep C-type inactivated conformation to a conductive one. Finally, we provide a crystallographic demonstration that closed-state inactivation can be achieved by the structural collapse of the channel’s selectivity filter.

Here we show that anxiety directly influences social dominance in male outbred rats and identify an important mediating role for mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens. High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low-anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as decreased ATP and increased ROS production in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals. We conclude that mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens is crucial for social behavior and is critically involved in the low social competitiveness associated with high anxiety.

This resistance is mediated by sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. In addition, we found that SREBP1-mediated ferroptosis resistance can be overcome by targeting the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway.

This problem can be addressed by the development of new antibacterial agents to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. Here, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best candidate is synthetically more accessible, exhibits higher solubility and binding affinity to the ribosome, and is up to 56 times more active against resistant pathogens than telithromycin. Notably, the best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. The results of this study provide a proof of concept for the rational design of new antibiotics. This approach can be extended to other antibiotic classes and to other targets of interest.

We also found that APOE alleles are highly dependent on each other in controlling the rate of C1q accumulation in the brain, which may represent the accumulation of senescent synapses with enhanced vulnerability to complement-mediated neurodegeneration. These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes.

We find that local curvature favors severing, while tension has no effect on cofilin binding and weakly enhances severing. Remarkably, we observe that filament segments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist, experience a mechanical torque upon cofilin binding. We find that this ADF-induced torque dramatically enhances severing. A simple model, which faithfully recapitulates our experimental observations, indicates that the ADF-induced torque increases the severing rate constant 100-fold. We propose that this mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells.

We find that the presence of Ψ can promote the low-level synthesis of multiple peptide products from a single mRNA sequence in the reconstituted translation system as well as human cells, and increases the rate of near-cognate Val-tRNAVal reacting on a ΨUU codon. The vast majority of Ψ moieties in mRNAs are found in coding regions, and our study suggests that one consequence of the ribosome encountering Ψ can be to modestly alter both translation speed and mRNA decoding.

We also show that the enzyme responsible for removing Np4-capped RNAs, RppH, prefers to decape them over their triphosphorylated and diphosphorylated counterparts. This preference is due to a unique mechanism of substrate recognition, in which the δ-phosphate, rather than the β-phosphate, is the site of attack.

This instrument, verified by the Monte Carlo simulation and coincident observations of other techniques, was used to conduct a case study over Beijing. The observed water cloud profiles identify that due to air entrainment its vertical structure is not perfectly adiabatic, as assumed by many current retrieval methods. Our ACI analysis shows increased aerosol loading led to increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius—consistent with expectations—but had no discernible increase on liquid water path. This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation.

They are also the main targets of drugs. The pore gate of an ion channel is the main site of drug binding and the main determinant of channel function. The pore gate is composed of two gates, one for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other for slow inactivation/recovery. In this study, we found that the pore gate of the K+ channel, the BK channel, is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability."

This finding would constitute a major change in our concept of malaria parasite invasion, suggesting it is, in fact, a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces working together to facilitate entry. This work provides a new perspective on the invasion process and opens up a number of exciting avenues for future research. (Show more)"

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, in the days (Studies 1 and 2) and months (Studies 3 through 6) following the 2016 election, women’s and men’s endorsement of HM predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. In addition, as conceptualized, HM was associated with less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors.

These results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This approach could be used in combination with other therapies, such as chemotherapy, to treat AML. Thus, IL1RAP could be a promising target for the development of novel and more efficient therapies for AML."

The island is located ∼400 km from the east coast of Africa, but its genetic and linguistic diversity is from both Southeast Asia and Eastern Africa. We used a grid-based approach to sample the genomic diversity across Madagascar and found that the Malagasy population is a mixture of Bantu and Austronesian populations. The settlement history of Madagascar is also complex, with a recent population growth and a sex-biased colonization. In addition, we found that the genetic structure of the Malagasy population is influenced by geography, suggesting that the settlement of Madagascar happened in several independent events. These results provide insights into the human history of Madagascar and the settlement of the island."

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (denoted GlpD) and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete. This work provides insight into the mechanism of action of the AzuC protein and the role of the RNA in carbon utilization. It also demonstrates the importance of considering the protein and RNA"

We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% by the year 2100 under an intermediate-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5 [SSP2-4.5]) and to 80% under a high-emission scenario (SSP5-8.5).

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the autism-risk genes and their functions and may facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies for autism. (PsycINFO Database Record"

To better understand the mechanisms of MERS-CoV infection, we engineered MERS viruses with mutations that blocked the sequential proteolytic events required for virus entry. These mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Therefore, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence."

We show that the majority of the nutrients that fuel algal blooms in the nearshore zone of large lakes originate from small tributaries, which are often overlooked in nutrient management efforts. Our findings suggest that small watersheds may be a significant source of nutrients that fuel algal blooms in the nearshore zone of large lakes. Our results highlight the importance of small watersheds in coastal eutrophication and provide a framework for targeting nutrient management efforts to reduce the ecological impacts of nutrient loading on valuable nearshore ecosystems."

We find that the long-time dynamics of such systems are biased toward states that exhibit a fine-tuned extremization of environmental forcing. This behavior is reminiscent of the “fine-tuning problem” in cosmology, where the existence of a large-scale bias in the initial conditions is required to explain the observed properties of the universe."

However, the history of C perturbations during abrupt climate change events has been largely ignored. Here, we present a study of a major C perturbation and global warming event (∼304 Ma) that occurred during a paleo-glacial state. We show that the event was linked to an injection of organic matter–derived C over ∼300 kyr and to near 20% of areal extent of seafloor anoxia. Modeling indicates that the event was linked to enhanced thermocline stratification and increased nutrient fluxes during this global warming within an icehouse. This study provides a key link between the history of C perturbations and the history of climate change. It also provides a potential mechanism for the origin of the “missing carbon” problem."

We show that RSPO certification is associated with a 33% reduction in deforestation in oil palm plantations in Indonesia. However, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results suggest that certification is a useful tool for reducing deforestation in oil palm, but it is not a silver bullet."

The exocytosis process is tightly regulated, and any disruption in the regulation of the exocytosis process can lead to diseases. In this study, we discovered a small molecule that can inhibit the exocytosis process in plants and humans. This study provides a valuable tool for studying the regulation of the exocytosis process and a potential drug target for diseases related to the exocytosis process.

In species with polygenic sex determination, multiple alleles are segregating within a single species, allowing for more than two genotypic sexes. Here we show that the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii has four possible sex classes: ZZXX females, ZWXX females, ZWXY females, and ZZXY males. We show that the interplay of sex linkage and sex limitation results in modular variation in morphological and behavioral traits. The modularity of secondary sexual characteristics produced by polygenic sex determination provides context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations."

This study provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key derived feature of the human hand, the third metacarpal styloid process. This finding suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato.

Here we show that the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) is a metabolic target for cancer therapy. We identify a small-molecule inhibitor of SHMT, and show that it blocks tumor growth in a mouse model of colon cancer. We also show that the one-carbon donor, formate, is a potent rescue of SHMT inhibition, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in a cancer cell-line screen. We show that formate is a critical import of glycine in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a cancer that is particularly sensitive to SHMT inhibition. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. These findings provide a rationale for the use of formate in the treatment of cancer, and a target for the development of new cancer therapeutics."

We show that the increase in mechanization has led to the propagation of subsoil compaction into deeper soil layers, which now exceeds safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We also show that the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods. This suggests that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, and that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. Our findings have implications for the design of farm machinery and for the study of prehistoric animals."
