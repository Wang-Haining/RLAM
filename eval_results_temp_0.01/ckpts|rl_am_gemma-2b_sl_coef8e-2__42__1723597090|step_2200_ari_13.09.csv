In this paper, we provide a purely categorical approach to the foundations of quantum theory. The approach is based on a set of axioms that guarantee that a category is equivalent to that of continuous linear functions between Hilbert spaces. The axioms are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. This approach addresses a question about the foundations of quantum theory raised in reconstruction programs such as those of von Neumann, Mackey, Jauch, Piron, Abramsky, and Coecke. The approach is also relevant to the foundations of mathematics in general."

The evolutionary origin of the myxozoan body plan, which is characterized by a distinctive structure, the polar capsule, is unknown. Here, we present the first genomic and transcriptomic analyses of two myxozoan species, which represent the most distant lineages in the group. Our results show that myxozoans are cnidarians and are a sister group to the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our analyses also reveal that myxozoans have one of the smallest reported animal genomes and that they have lost many genes involved in signaling and cell–cell communication. These results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. (Show more)"

The virus is able to evade the host immune response by blocking the action of the interferon (IFN) system. In this study, we show that the SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein Orf6 is able to block nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, two key components of the IFN signaling pathway. We found that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and interacts with the Nup98-Rae1 complex to impair nuclear import of cargo proteins. Our data reveal a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the host immune response and may lead to the development of new strategies to combat the pandemic.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. Sperm cells are quiescent in the male reproductive system due to Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels, but become active once introduced into the low-Zn2+-concentration environment of the female reproductive tract. How Zn2+ inhibits proton channels is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

We use global datasets of maize production and climate variability combined with future temperature projections to quantify how yield variability will change in the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. We find that as the global mean temperature increases, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields increases almost everywhere to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields. For the top four maize-exporting countries, which account for 87% of global maize exports, the probability that they have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet composition for seven species of large herbivores in a semiarid African savanna. We found that the proportion of grass in the diet varied widely among species, from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers. Grass consumption was highly correlated with stable isotope estimates of grass consumption, indicating that RRA is a reliable quantitative measure of diet. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption, but dietary composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages, and that large herbivore diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.

We found that the activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis, which is highly frequent in cancer, confers ferroptosis resistance. This resistance is mediated by the activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. We also found that inhibition of SREBP1 or the fatty acid desaturase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), which is a transcriptional target of SREBP1, sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis.

This problem can be addressed by the development of new antibacterial agents to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. Computational approaches are essential tools to this end since their application enables fast and early strategical decisions in the drug development process. We present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

The presence of two copies of the E4 allele increases risk by ∼12-fold whereas E2 allele is associated with an ∼twofold decreased risk for AD. These data put APOE central to AD pathophysiology, but it is not yet clear how APOE alleles modify AD risk. Here, we report a novel role for APOE in controlling the phagocytic capacity of astrocytes that is highly dependent on APOE isoform. These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes. They also suggest the hypothesis that AD susceptibility of APOE4 may originate in part from defective phagocytic capacity of astrocytes which accelerates the rate of accumulation of senescent synapses, enhancing synaptic vulnerability to classical-complement-cascade mediated neurodegeneration.

We find that ADF/cofilin is able to sever filaments that are connected by other filaments, which is not the case for filaments that are not connected. We propose that this is due to the mechanical torque that is generated by the connection of filaments. This torque is critical to boost the severing rate of ADF/cofilin.

It is the only island in the world that is both a biodiversity hotspot and a country. However, its history is still debated. We used a grid-based approach to sample at high resolution the genomic diversity (including maternal lineages, paternal lineages, and genome-wide data) across 257 villages and 2,704 Malagasy individuals. We find a common Bantu and Austronesian descent for all Malagasy individuals with a limited paternal contribution from Europe and the Middle East. Admixture and demographic growth happened recently, suggesting a rapid settlement of Madagascar during the last millennium. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, there are geographic influences on the present genomic diversity, independent of the admixture, showing that a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. These results provide insights into the history of Madagascar and its people. They also provide a reference for the genomic diversity of Madagascar and its people"

The parasite, Plasmodium, invades the human red blood cell (RBC) to complete its life cycle. The invasion process is a complex event that requires the interaction of multiple parasite proteins with the RBC surface. Here, we show that one of these proteins, EBA175, alters the physical properties of the RBC membrane, reducing the energy barrier to invasion. This finding suggests that the malaria parasite primes the RBC surface, altering the physical properties of the target cell, and thus reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion. This would constitute a major change in our understanding of malaria parasite invasion. (Show more)"

In the temperate regions, seasonal influenza virus outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in humidity. While low ambient humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings have important implications for understanding the impact of climate change on influenza virus transmission and disease outcome.

However, whether and how the brain builds such structures remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the brain’s activity increases with each successive word in a sentence but decreases suddenly whenever words can be merged into a phrase. This merge operation is applied equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity, providing evidence for a merge operation that applies equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity. More superficial models of language, based solely on sequential transition probability over lexical and syntactic categories, only captured activity in the posterior middle temporal gyrus. Formal model comparison indicated that the model of multiword phrase construction provided a better fit than probability-based models at most sites in superior temporal and inferior frontal cortices. Activity in those regions was consistent with a neural implementation of a bottom-up or left-corner parser of the incoming language stream. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases."

This paper presents a method to determine the origin of the animal skins used in the production of parchment. The method is based on the use of a simple, noninvasive, and objective technique to extract proteins from the parchment surface. The method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals, but we did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides. These results suggest that ultrafine vellum does not necessarily derive from the use of abortive or newborn animals with ultrathin hides, but could equally well reflect a production process that allowed the skins of maturing animals of several species to be rendered into vellum of equal quality and fineness.

There is an urgent need for novel and more efficient therapies for AML, ideally targeting AML stem cells that are essential for maintaining the disease. Here, we show that an antibody targeting the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) is effective in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that the observed therapeutic effects are dependent on effector-cell–mediated killing and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. We also show that the antibody can suppress the proliferation of primary human AML cells. These results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This approach could be used to treat other types of cancer as well.

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein.

The RNA encodes a protein that interacts with glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and increases dehydrogenase activity. This protein also interferes with the ability of a regulatory RNA to repress carbon utilization genes. These results demonstrate that the protein and RNA compete for the same binding sites and that the protein can have multiple functions.

We also show that the CPC is a powerful source of information for monitoring crop status, and can be used to provide earlier and more precise predictions of crop yields than official USDA forecasts released midseason. This work demonstrates the potential of the CPC to provide a more complete picture of agricultural production, and to improve the accuracy of agricultural decision-making."

In this study, we found that neuroinflammation was reduced in both the early and later stages of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in microglia/macrophage-specific ASK1 knockout mice, whereas only the later-stage neuroinflammation was ameliorated in astrocyte-specific ASK1 knockout mice. ASK1 signaling in microglia played a major role in generating and maintaining disease. Activated astrocytes produce key inflammatory mediators, including CCL2, that further activated and recruited microglia/macrophages, in an astrocytic ASK1-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that glial ASK1 as a promising therapeutic target for reducing neuroinflammation.

The etiology of autism is so complicated because it involves the effects of variants of several hundred risk genes along with the contribution of environmental factors. Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. As an alternative approach, extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying the convergence of the targets and functions of the autism-risk genes to facilitate mapping out causal paths. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that the reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a new perspective for understanding the etiology of autism.

We also show that the within-host dynamics of ZIKV are sensitive to the rate of viral production, the rate of viral clearance, and the rate of cell death. We predict that a drug that blocks viral replication can reduce the peak median viral load by ∼3 logs and shorten the time to undetectable median viral load by ∼2 d. These predictions can be used to guide the design of clinical trials. (Show more)"

Our understanding of the underlying causes of the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis is incomplete. Here, we show that altered nutrient cycling during heat stress is a primary driver of the functional breakdown of the symbiosis. Heat stress increased the metabolic energy demand of the coral host, which was compensated by the catabolic degradation of amino acids. The resulting shift from net uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont subsequently promoted the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host. Energy limitation and altered symbiotic nutrient cycling are thus key factors in the early heat stress response, directly contributing to the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis. Interpreting the stability of the coral holobiont in light of its metabolic interactions provides a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general."

Our findings highlight the importance of controlling the activity of JNK signaling to maintain epithelial barrier function and host–microbe homeostasis. They also provide a mechanism by which the tumor microenvironment can influence the host immune system to promote its own growth.

However, the role of FSIP1 in the progression and drug sensitivity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection.

We show that the size, shape, compactness, stiffness, and attachment location of the DNA nanostructure are the key design parameters that determine the internalization efficiency of the DNA nanostructure into plant cells. We also show that the internalization efficiency of DNA nanostructures correlates with their respective gene silencing efficiencies but that the endogenous gene silencing pathway depends on the attachment location of the siRNA. Our work establishes the feasibility of biomolecule delivery to plants with DNA nanostructures and both details the design parameters of importance for plant cell internalization and also assesses the impact of DNA nanostructure geometry for gene silencing mechanisms. This work is a significant step toward the development of DNA nanostructures as a tool for plant biology."

In the United States, the majority of nutrient loading to lakes is from nonpoint sources, such as agricultural fields and urban areas. However, the majority of the country’s lakes are connected to large rivers, and the nutrient loads from these rivers are often dominated by a small number of large tributaries. We show that the nutrient loads from small tributaries are often high for their size, and that these nutrients are more likely to be in the form of dissolved inorganic nutrients, which are more bioavailable to algae. This work highlights the importance of small tributaries in driving coastal eutrophication in large water bodies."

However, the impact of certification on deforestation and fire remains unclear. We use a comprehensive dataset of oil palm plantations in Indonesia to evaluate the impact of certification on deforestation and fire. We find that certification reduced deforestation by 33% from a counterfactual of 9.8 to 6.6% y−1. Nevertheless, most plantations contained little residual forest when they received certification. As a result, certified areas held less than 1% of forests remaining within Indonesian oil palm plantations in 2015. Certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. This study highlights the importance of certification in forested regions and the need for certification to be part of a broader effort to reduce deforestation."

In humans, its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. Investigation of the dynamic regulation of the exocyst-related processes using mutants in genetically tractable organisms such as Arabidopsis thaliana is limited by the lethality or the severity of phenotypes. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 (exocyst component of 70 kDa) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

We show that the weight of modern farm machinery has increased by a factor of 10 since the 1960s, and that this increase has led to a shift in the distribution of stresses in the soil. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants.
