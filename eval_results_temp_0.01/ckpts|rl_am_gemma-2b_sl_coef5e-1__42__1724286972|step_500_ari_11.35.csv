However, the structure of hydrate with guest molecules is still controversial. In this work, we report the structure of hydrate with neon, which is a guest molecule in hydrate. The structure of hydrate with neon is different from that with methane. The guest molecules in hydrate are not only bonded to the host lattices but also enclathrated in the host lattices. The guest molecules are free to move in the host lattices. This work provides a new insight into the structure of hydrate. It also provides a new way to store gases.

The evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, and a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we present a genomic and transcriptomic analysis of two distantly related myxozoan species and compare these to the transcriptome and genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content.

In this study, we show that the accessory protein Orf6 of SARS-CoV-2 is able to block nuclear import of IFN-stimulated factors (ISFs) in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes. We found that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain. This interaction is required for Orf6 to block nuclear import. Our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

We use a statistical model to project how maize yields will change in the major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. We find that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields will increase to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields. The probability that the top four maize-exporting countries have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes.

DNA metabarcoding is a powerful technique for identifying species in complex mixtures of DNA. We used this method to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven large mammalian herbivores in a semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species, even pairs of closely related species. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammal assemblages. Our findings also highlight the importance of plant diversity in structuring LMH communities. These insights may help to explain the coexistence of LMH in semiarid savannas, where they are abundant but rarely observed together. Our results suggest that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

This is due to size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean.

Here we show that the insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) is a key regulator of hemoglobin expression in human erythroblasts. IGF2BP1 is expressed in adult bone marrow and is silenced in fetal liver. In erythroid cells, IGF2BP1 causes a nearly complete reversal of the adult hemoglobin expression pattern toward a more fetal-like phenotype. This is achieved by reduced expression of the alpha-globin gene and increased expression of the gamma-globin gene. The mechanism of this reprogramming is mediated by reduced protein expression of the transcription factor BCL11A. These results suggest a mechanism for chronoregulation of fetal and adult hemoglobin expression in humans. This mechanism may be relevant to the development of hemoglobinopathies.

Cancer cells are characterized by metabolic reprogramming, which is essential for their survival and proliferation. In this study, we found that cancer cells with mutations in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway are resistant to ferroptosis, a form of regulated necrosis driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. This resistance is mediated by the activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. We also found that SREBP1-mediated ferroptosis resistance can be overcome by targeting the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway.

The shift in hydroclimate is consistent with a change in the orbital forcing of climate. The record also shows that the lake has been much lower in the past, and that the species flock has been exposed to periods of extreme drought.

Thus, although CTLA-4–deficient mice have more severe collagen-induced arthritis, they are protected against peptide-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. This indicates that CTLA-4 deficiency affects both central and peripheral tolerance. These findings provide a better understanding of the role of CTLA-4 in the development of autoimmunity.

These social-learning conditions were compared with an asocial individual-learning condition in which individual participants made repeated attempts at constructing a paper plane, without having access to any planes produced by other participants. Larger populations generated greater variation in plane performance and gave participants access to better-adapted planes, but this did not enhance CCE. In fact, there was an inverse relationship between population size and CCE: plane flight distance did not improve over the experimental generations in the 2-Model and 4-Model conditions, but did improve over generations in the 1-Model social-learning condition.

We also found that the amount of complement component 1q accumulation in hippocampus, which may represent the accumulation of senescent synapses with enhanced vulnerability to complement-mediated degeneration, is highly dependent on APOE alleles. These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes. They also suggest the hypothesis that AD susceptibility of APOE4 may originate in part from defective phagocytic capacity of astrocytes which accelerates the rate of accumulation of complement-coated senescent synapses, enhancing synaptic vulnerability to complement-mediated neurodegeneration.

The first step is the nucleation of the bcc phase, which is more energetically favorable than the hcp phase. The second step is the transformation of the bcc phase to the hcp phase.

TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness.

It is involved in many cellular processes, including cell motility, cell division, and cell morphogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism of ADF action is still poorly understood. Here, we show that ADF can induce a mechanical torque on actin filaments, which enhances severing. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. Our results provide a molecular understanding of ADF’s function in cells. They also provide a general mechanism for understanding how mechanical forces can enhance chemical reactions. This mechanism may be relevant to many other biological processes.

The results show that the aerosol loading has no discernible effect on the liquid water path but increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius. This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations obtained from the dual-FOV HSRL constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The temperature inferred from isotopic evidence is ∼15 °C today, but this value is subject to question due to uncertainties regarding oceanic isotopic compositions, diagenetic or metamorphic resetting of the isotopic record, and depositional environments. We here present a method for determining the temperature of ancient Earth surfaces based on the thermostability of reconstructed ancestral enzymes. Our results suggest that Earth’s surface temperature decreased over geological time from ∼65–80 °C in the Archean. This finding is consistent both with previous isotope-based and protein reconstruction-based interpretations. Interdisciplinary studies such as those reported here integrating genomic, geologic, and paleontologic data hold promise for providing new insight into the coevolution of life and environment over Earth history.

Ion channels are also regulated by opening and closing their pore gates. Ion channels commonly possess two pore gates, one for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that BK channel C-type inactivation is state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. Our findings may help to understand the mechanism of K+ channel regulation. They may also provide insights into the mechanism of drug action and drug resistance.

The acoustic sensors of animals are diverse in morphology and function. The auditory organs of all mammals, birds, and reptiles are part of their bodies. The auditory organs of fish and arthropods are not part of their bodies but are made up of cellular tissue. Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is outsourced to its proteinaceous, self-manufactured web. The spider’s web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to detect and localize the source of an incoming acoustic wave. The spider supersizes its web to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously. The spider also enables the flexibility to functionally adjust and regularly regenerate its external ""eardrum"" according to its needs. The outsourcing and supersizing of auditory function in spiders provide unique features for studying extended and regenerative sensing and for designing novel acoustic flow detectors.

One of these proteins is proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which is essential for DNA replication. PCNA is a sliding clamp that facilitates DNA synthesis by DNA polymerases. In humans, the lagging strand of DNA synthesis is replicated by DNA polymerase δ (pol δ). We have developed unique kinetic assays to measure the processivity and stability of pol δ. We find that pol δ is a processive enzyme that dissociates from PCNA rapidly. This behavior is important for the replication of the lagging strand because it limits the length of the DNA that pol δ can replicate before dissociation. It also promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from DNA lesions. These results have implications for the replication of the lagging strand in humans. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc."

In the hypothesized RNA world, before the evolution of proteins, nucleic acids were the genetic material. In the laboratory, RNA can replicate itself, but it has been difficult to evolve an RNA polymerase ribozyme that can replicate other RNA molecules. Here, we report the successful evolution of an RNA polymerase ribozyme that can replicate RNA templates. This improved polymerase can synthesize a variety of RNA molecules, including aptamers, ribozymes, and tRNA. Furthermore, it can amplify short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA.

Plant and cyanobacterial mutants in ycf54 display impaired function of the diiron enzyme, accumulating the reaction substrate. Swapping cyclases between cyanobacteria and purple phototrophic bacteria reveals three classes of the diiron enzyme.

ASK1 deficiency in microglia/macrophages ameliorated both the early and later stages of EAE. ASK1 signaling in microglia/macrophages induced a proinflammatory environment, which subsequently activated astrocytes to exacerbate neuroinflammation. ASK1-deficient astrocytes produced key inflammatory mediators, including CCL2, which further activated and recruited microglia/macrophages.

The etiology of autism is so complicated because it involves the effects of variants of several hundred risk genes along with the contribution of environmental factors. Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a unique example of a convergent mechanism for autism-risk genes. It also provides a model system for studying the underlying mechanisms of behavioral flexibility. This article is protected by copyright. All rights"

The disease is caused by mutations in multiple genes, including those that encode proteins involved in RNA processing and protein trafficking. Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions in the brain and spinal cord of ALS patients are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. We observe that the proteins that form inclusions in ALS have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. This study provides a potential mechanism for the formation of inclusion bodies in ALS. It also suggests that the presence of proteins that are supersaturated in the brain and spinal cord of ALS patients may be a common feature of other neurodegenerative diseases. Copyright © 2015.

The device configuration also enables application of optical tweezers for controlled placement of atoms. Devices can be fabricated reliably from a 200-nm silicon nitride device layer using a lithography-based process, producing predicted optical properties in transmission and reflection measurements.

Some have proposed that the origin of the flowering plants was in a darkened forest habitat. Others have proposed that the origin of the flowering plants was in an open aquatic habitat. The research presented here centers on Montsechia vidalii, a plant first recovered from lithographic limestone deposits in the Pyrenees of Spain more than 100 y ago. This fossil material has been poorly understood and misinterpreted in the past. Now, based upon the study of more than 1,000 carefully prepared specimens, a detailed analysis of Montsechia is presented. The morphology and anatomy of the plant, including aspects of its reproduction, suggest that Montsechia is sister to Ceratophyllum (whenever cladistic analyses are made with or without a backbone). Montsechia was an aquatic angiosperm living and reproducing below the surface of the water, similar to Ceratophyllum. Montsechia is Barremian in age, raising questions about the very early divergence of the Ceratophyllum clade compared with its position as sister to eudicots in many cladistic analyses.

The virus causes severe respiratory disease. To understand how sequential proteolysis contributes to MERS-CoV infection, we introduced mutations that blocked the first proteolytic events. These mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses trafficked past cell-surface proteases and into endosomes, whereas precleaved viruses used endosomal proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence.

We demonstrate that ETV2 induces expression of multiple key endothelial development factors, including FLI1, ERG, and TAL1, and induces expression of endothelial functional molecules, including EGFL7 and von Willebrand factor. Consequently, ETV2-transduced cells exhibit EC characteristics in vitro and form mature functional vasculature in Matrigel plugs transplanted in mice.

The genome of the virus is segmented into eight fragments. The packaging of the genome is essential for the production of infectious virions. However, the molecular details of the packaging mechanism are unknown. Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus. This interaction is required for optimal viral replication. We also show that this interaction favors copackaging of the interacting viral RNA segments. This interaction might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses. Our results provide insights into the packaging mechanism of the influenza A virus. They also suggest that the packaging signals are not the only interactions involved in the packaging process. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc."

This loss of symbiosis is often assumed to be the result of heat stress, but the underlying mechanisms are still debated. Here, we show that the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis is driven by altered nutrient cycling. We demonstrate that the catabolism of amino acids during heat stress increases the release of ammonium from the coral host, which in turn promotes the growth of algal symbionts and the retention of photosynthates. These processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host. This study provides a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

However, the response to chemotherapy is heterogeneous, and some patients relapse despite receiving multiple cycles of treatment. We show that the type I tyrosine kinaselike orphan receptor ROR1 is expressed in breast cancer cells and is up-regulated following chemotherapy. ROR1 expression is associated with the expression of genes involved in breast cancer stemness. ROR1 expression also enhances the capacity of breast cancer cells to invade Matrigel, form spheroids, engraft in Rag2−/−γc−/− mice, or survive treatment with paclitaxel. We also show that the humanized anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab can repress the expression of genes associated with breast cancer stemness, reduce activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or BMI1, and impair the capacity of breast cancer PDXs to metastasize or reengraft Rag2−/−γc−/− mice. Finally, treatment of mice bearing breast cancer patient-derived xenografts with cirmtuzumab and paclitaxel was more effective than treatment with either alone in eradicating breast cancer PDXs.

However, the spatial coincidence of productive fisheries and low food security highlights the critical role of rivers in providing locally sourced, low-cost protein. At the same time, intensive fishing in regions where rivers are already degraded by other stressors may undermine efforts to conserve biodiversity. This syndrome of poverty, nutritional deficiency, fishery dependence, and extrinsic threats to biodiverse river ecosystems underscores the high stakes for improving fishery management. Our enhanced spatial data on estimated catches can facilitate the inclusion of inland fisheries in environmental planning to protect both food security and species diversity."

These connections suggest that DLK-independent regeneration may be a powerful platform for gene discovery in neuronal regeneration. Moreover, we note numerous similarities between DLK-independent regeneration and lesion conditioning, a phenomenon producing robust regeneration in the mammalian CNS. Taken as a whole, our study unites disparate forms of regeneration to uncover fresh molecular insights into activity-dependent control of the adult nervous system’s intrinsic regenerative capacity.

FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. This article is protected by copyright.

This study shows that the FT gene in dodder is not involved in flowering regulation. Instead, the FT protein is able to move from the host to the dodder, where it physically interacts with a dodder FD transcription factor to activate dodder flowering. This study demonstrates that FTs can function as an important interplant flowering signal in host–dodder interactions. The unique means of flowering regulation of dodder illustrates how regressive evolution, commonly found in parasites, may facilitate the physiological synchronization of parasite and host, here allowing the C. australis parasite to time reproduction exactly with that of their hosts. This may optimize parasite fitness. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

But how do we know when we feel connected to someone? We asked people to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. We found that the speed at which people responded to each other predicted how connected they felt. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

The SAN is composed of specialized cells, the sinoatrial cells (SACSs), which are responsible for generating the heart rate. The SAN is a highly specialized cell, and its function is tightly regulated. Here, we report that stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is a key regulator of the function of the SAN. We show that STIM1 is expressed in the specialized cells of the SAN and that its deletion in mice results in a loss of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores in these cells. This loss of Ca2+ stores results in a loss of the ability of these cells to generate a regular heart rhythm. These studies reveal a previously unknown role for STIM1 in the regulation of Ca2+ stores in specialized cells of the heart. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

These findings offer insights into the mechanisms of action of NMDAR-Ab encephalitis.

Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results suggest that certification is not a silver bullet for tropical deforestation. Rather, it is a tool that can be used to reduce deforestation in some regions.

We show that the increase in capacity of farm machinery has led to higher subsoil stresses that now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants.
