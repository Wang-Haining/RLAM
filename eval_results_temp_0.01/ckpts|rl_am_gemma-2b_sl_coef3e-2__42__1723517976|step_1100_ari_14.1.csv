However, the structure of the hydrate formed by the enclathration of neon into ice II has not been reported. In this work, we report the structure of neon hydrate at high pressure and low temperature. The structure of neon hydrate is found to be in excellent agreement with the calculated structure. The results provide a new route to study the structure of ice II and the structure of hydrates. They also provide a new route to study the structure of ice II, which is the most stable phase of water at high pressure and low temperature."

Although the evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we report the results of a genomic and transcriptomic analysis of two distantly related myxozoan species, Kudoa iwatai and Myxobolus cerebralis, and compare these to the transcriptome and genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that the accessory protein Orf6 of SARS-CoV-2 is able to block nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are essential for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We found that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the host immune response and may lead to the design of antiviral strategies. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1, but the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

However, the extent to which LMH partition food resources is largely unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level differences in diet. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant LMH species (six wild, one domestic) in semiarid African savanna. We found that LMH consumed a wide range of plant species, and that species were dissimilar in their diets. Nonetheless, species were not randomly distributed along a continuum of dietary similarity, suggesting that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results highlight the importance of diet composition in determining the extent to which LMH partition food resources, and suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages. These findings have implications for understanding the role of LMH in grassland ecosystems and biodiversity more generally."

Our observations of the size distribution of floating plastic debris point at important size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered.

A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals.

The NWFP also failed to halt the decline of early-seral ecosystems on private industrial lands, where clearcutting continued. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure."

The problem is aggravated by the emergence of antibiotic resistance, which is a major threat to global health. Computational approaches are essential tools to this end since their application enables fast and early strategical decisions in the drug development process. Here, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. The best candidate is synthetically more accessible, exhibits higher solubility and binding affinity to the ribosome, and is up to 56 times more active against resistant pathogens than telithromycin. Notably, the best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. The presented approach can be used to design new antibiotics for other classes of antibiotics. This will help to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens and to address the problem of antibiotic resistance."

We observe dramatic shifts in effective moisture, resulting in large-scale changes in one of the world’s largest lakes and most diverse freshwater ecosystems. The shift in hydroclimate is consistent with a change in climate forcing, consistent with far-field climate forcing, which separates vastly different hydroclimate regimes before and after the Mid-Pleistocene Transition. The record provides evidence for a link between extreme hydroclimate variability and the evolution of the Lake Malawi endemic cichlid fish species flock."

Here we show that reading an electronic book on a light-emitting device suppresses melatonin secretion and reduces the timing of the circadian clock, and that this effect is associated with reduced sleepiness and reduced alertness the next morning. These results demonstrate the importance of understanding the impact of electronic devices on sleep and health.

The island is located ∼400 km from the east coast of Africa, but its genetic and linguistic traits are from both Southeast Asia and Eastern Africa. We used a grid-based approach to sample the island at high resolution, and we found that the Malagasy population is a mixture of Bantu and Austronesian populations, with a limited contribution from Europe and the Middle East. The distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, we found that a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. This study provides a detailed picture of the human history of Madagascar. It also provides a framework for the study of the human history of other islands in the Indian Ocean. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The collective nature of protein folding makes it difficult to study, and it is difficult to obtain a complete picture of the folding process. We have developed a method that allows the study of the folding of a single protein at high structural resolution. We have used this method to study the folding of maltose binding protein, a protein that is known to fold through distinct native-like intermediates in distinct pathways. The results indicate that the intermediates are obligatory steps on the folding pathway and that the intermediates are not the end of the folding process. These results add a large protein to the list of proteins known to fold through distinct native-like intermediates in distinct pathways.

The most widely accepted interpretation is that the surface cooled from ∼70 °C in the Archean to the present ∼15 °C. However, this interpretation has been subject to question due to uncertainties regarding the isotopic record, diagenetic or metamorphic resetting of the isotopic record, and depositional environments. We here present a method for determining the temperature of Earth’s surface based on the thermostability of reconstructed ancestral enzymes. Our results suggest that Earth’s surface temperature decreased over geological time from ∼65–80 °C in the Archean, a finding consistent both with previous isotope-based and protein reconstruction-based interpretations. Interdisciplinary studies such as those reported here integrating genomic, geologic, and paleontologic data hold promise for providing new insight into the coevolution of life and environment over Earth history.

The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. These findings provide a new perspective on the regulation of ion channels. (Show more)"

More superficial models of language, based on sequential transition probabilities, only captured activity in the posterior middle temporal gyrus. Activity in superior temporal and inferior frontal regions was consistent with a neural implementation of a bottom-up or left-corner parser.

The stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is critical for the synthesis of the lagging strand, but the mechanism by which this stability is achieved is unknown. We have developed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. Our results indicate that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This study provides a unique insight into the mechanism of DNA replication in eukaryotes. It also provides a platform for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.

We connect changes in the physical appearance of five US cities with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities."

These metabolites have significant metal-dependent antimicrobial properties, and the ability of xan cluster metabolites to bind copper is supported by the observation that copper-dependent inhibition of laccase activity is observed in a xanthocillin-treated Pseudomonas aeruginosa culture.

We illustrate our method with a prominent example of underutilized text: the US National Violent Death Reporting System. Our results provide a detailed quantitative picture of reporting about lethal violence and its gendered nature. Our method offers a flexible and broadly applicable approach to model topics in text data.

We show that the introduction of Y. pestis into European harbors was preceded by climate-driven reintroductions of the bacterium into Asian harbors, with a delay of 15 ± 1 y. We provide evidence for repeated climate-driven reintroductions of the bacterium into European harbors from reservoirs in Asia, with a delay of 15 ± 1 y.

The identification of targets for therapy is therefore of great importance. We show here that the IL1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) is expressed on candidate leukemic stem cells in the majority of AML patients, but not on normal hematopoietic stem cells. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. These results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. (Show more)"

We used a grid-based approach to sample the island at high resolution, and we found that the Malagasy population is a mixture of Bantu and Austronesian populations, with a limited contribution from Europe and the Middle East. The distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, we found that a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. This study provides a detailed picture of the human history of Madagascar.

The RNA encodes a protein that increases the activity of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of glycerol. We found that the protein interferes with the action of the RNA, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete. This study provides insight into the evolution of dual-function RNAs and the mechanisms by which they compete with each other. It also provides a mechanism for the action of a small RNA that has been shown to repress two genes. This mechanism may be relevant to other sRNAs that repress multiple genes."

We demonstrate that the relaxation of selection is linked to the establishment of a parasitic lifestyle, which is characterized by the parasite’s dependence on a host to fulfill its life cycle. Our findings suggest that the transition from autotrophy to heterotrophy is a stepwise process, in which the parasite’s dependence on a host gradually replaces photosynthesis as the main selection pressure on the plastid genome. This process is accompanied by a stepwise relaxation of functional constraints on the plastid genome. This may have facilitated the evolution of the photosynthetic apparatus and the emergence of the first eukaryotes. (Show more)"

These results highlight the strong sensitivity of the drought risk in SSA to future anthropogenic emissions. This work provides a valuable contribution to the ongoing debate on the role of anthropogenic climate change in the recent droughts in SSA.

In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a framework for understanding the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms and suggests a potential therapeutic target for autism. (Show more)"

These proteins form characteristic intracellular inclusion bodies that are present in all forms of the disease. Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions in the brain and spinal cord of ALS patients have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. This may explain the heterogeneous nature of the disease and the presence of a variety of inclusions in the brain and spinal cord. This also suggests that the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in ALS may be a common feature of other neurodegenerative diseases. (Show more)"

We connect changes in the physical appearance of five US cities with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities."

Here we show that the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is altered by global warming. As temperatures increase, the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning becomes steeper, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to the thermal tolerance of species. First, more diverse communities had a greater chance of including species with thermal traits that enabled them to maintain productivity as temperatures shifted from ambient conditions. Second, we found a pronounced increase in the contribution of complementarity to the net biodiversity effect at high and low temperatures, indicating that changes in species interactions played a critical role in mediating the impacts of temperature change on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

SAN cells (SANCs) are responsible for the generation of the heart rate and are characterized by the presence of specialized Ca2+ release units, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), and a unique electrical architecture. The SR Ca2+ release units are the sites of Ca2+ oscillations that are essential for the generation of action potentials in SANCs. However, the mechanisms that regulate SR Ca2+ release and the electrical events occurring in the plasma membrane are not fully understood. Here, we report that stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is expressed in SANCs and regulates SR Ca2+ release and electrical events in SANCs. These studies reveal that STIM1 is a multifunctional regulator of Ca2+ dynamics in SANCs that links SR Ca2+ store content with electrical events occurring in the plasma membrane, thereby contributing to automaticity of the SAN. This study provides insights into the mechanisms that regulate SAN function. (Show more)"

Here, we show that Si enhances resistance against insect herbivory in rice by priming the jasmonate (JA) signaling pathway. We demonstrate that Si priming of JA signaling involves the promotion of JA accumulation and the activation of JA-responsive defense genes. Additionally, we show that Si priming of JA signaling is mediated by JA and is dependent on the expression of two key genes in the JA biosynthesis and perception pathways, allene oxide synthase and CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1. These results suggest that Si and JA may interact in plant defense against insect herbivores. (Show more)"
