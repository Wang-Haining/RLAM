Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of the proton channel. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is largely unknown because species-level identification is prohibitively difficult with traditional methods.

These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers. Grass consumption inferred from mean sequence relative read abundance (RRA) ranged from &gt;99% (plains zebra) to &lt;1% (dik-dik). Grass RRA was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of % grass consumption, indicating that RRA conveys reliable quantitative information about consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them.

A Threonine to Alanine substitution at this position was studied in three representative members of the K+-channel family. Interestingly, all of the mutant channels exhibited lack of C-type inactivation gating and an inversion of their allosteric coupling (i.e., closing of the activation gate collapses the channel’s selectivity filter).

This resistance is mediated by sustained activation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, which in turn activates sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. In this study, we show that SREBP1-mediated lipogenesis protects cancer cells from ferroptosis. We also show that SREBP1-mediated lipogenesis is required for the antiapoptotic activity of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway in cancer cells. Finally, we show that mTORC1 inhibition combined with SREBP1/SCD1 inhibition in preclinical models of cancer results in near-complete tumor regression. These findings suggest that SREBP1/SCD1-mediated lipogenesis is a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment. This study also provides a rationale for the combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction in the treatment of cancer. This combination therapy may be particularly effective in cancer cells with PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway mutation. The combination of mTORC1"

The development of new antibiotics is a major challenge, and computational approaches are essential tools to this end since their application enables fast and early strategical decisions in the drug development process. We present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

Results show evidence for 24 lake level drops of more than 200 m during the Late Quaternary, including 15 lowstands when water levels were more than 400 m lower than modern. A dramatic shift is observed at the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT), consistent with far-field climate forcing, which separates vastly different hydroclimate regimes before and after ∼800,000 years ago.

Today, most human plague cases are caused by inhalation of infectious droplets or by the bite of infected fleas. However, little is known about the historical spread of plague in Europe during the Second Pandemic (14–19th centuries), including the Black Death, which led to high mortality and recurrent epidemics for hundreds of years. Here, we describe a compartmental model for plague transmission by a human ectoparasite vector. Using Bayesian inference, we found that this model fits mortality curves from nine outbreaks in Europe better than models for pneumonic or rodent transmission. Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346–1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats.

Amniote brain evolution is characterized by the following four major shifts in neuron–brain scaling.

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal and transformed cells is more complex than previously appreciated. We have shown that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This study suggests that TRAP1 may be a promising target for cancer therapy. The TRAP1-null mouse model described in this study may be useful for testing the efficacy of TRAP1-directed therapies.

We find that ADF binds to actin filaments and disassembles them more efficiently when the filaments are under mechanical stress. We propose that this mechanism is critical to boost ADF’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells.

Here we demonstrate that the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa detects contact with surfaces on short timescales using the mechanical activity of its type IV pili, a major surface adhesin. This signal transduction mechanism requires attachment of type IV pili to a solid surface, followed by pilus retraction and signal transduction through the Chp chemosensory system, a chemotaxis-like sensory system that regulates cAMP production and transcription of hundreds of genes, including key virulence factors. Like other chemotaxis pathways, pili-mediated surface sensing results in a transient response amplified by a positive feedback that increases type IV pili activity, thereby promoting long-term surface attachment that can stimulate additional virulence and biofilm-inducing pathways. The methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein-like chemosensor PilJ directly interacts with the major pilin subunit PilA. Our results thus support a mechanochemical model where a chemosensory system measures the mechanically induced conformational changes in stretched type IV pili.

However, a global, quantitative view of how the biomass of different taxa compare with one another is still lacking. Here, we assemble the overall biomass composition of the biosphere, establishing a census of the ≈550 Gt C of biomass distributed among all of the kingdoms of life. We find that the kingdoms of life concentrate at different locations on the planet; plants (≈450 Gt C, the dominant kingdom) are primarily terrestrial, whereas animals (≈2 Gt C) are mainly marine, and bacteria (≈70 Gt C) and archaea (≈7 Gt C) are predominantly located in deep subsurface environments. We show that the global marine biomass pyramid contains more consumers than producers, thus increasing the scope of previous observations on inverse food pyramids. Finally, we highlight that the mass of humans is an order of magnitude higher than that of all wild mammals combined and report the historical impact of humanity on the global biomass of prominent taxa, including mammals, fish, and plants. Our results provide a global view of the biomass of the biosphere and its distribution among the kingdoms of life."

Our aim in this context is to present an idealized tropical toy model (cf. Turing reaction-diffusion model), requiring further investigation."

Here, we use proteomics to characterize the posttesticular life history of the Drosophila sperm proteome and determine the extent of molecular continuity between male and female reproductive tracts. We show that the male–female reproductive interface is a dynamic site of intersexual communication, with multiple proteins initially associating with sperm and then becoming associated with the female reproductive tract. Female-derived proteins are enriched for processes associated with energy metabolism, suggesting that female contributions support sperm viability during the prolonged period between copulation and fertilization. Our research provides a comprehensive characterization of sperm proteome dynamics and expands our understanding of the critical process of sperm–FRT interactions.

The A1 domain is important for VWF function in hemostasis. We show that force application switches the A1 domain to a second state with faster on-rate, providing a mechanism for activating VWF binding to platelets. Switching occurs near 10 pN, a force that also induces a state of the receptor−ligand complex with slower off-rate. Force greatly increases the effects of VWF mutations, explaining pathophysiology. Conversion of single molecule kon (s−1) to bulk phase kon (s−1M−1) and the kon and koff values extrapolated to zero force for the low-force pathways show remarkably good agreement with bulk-phase measurements. This suggests that the A1 domain is in a conformational switch. The switch is likely triggered by the conformational change in the GPIbα receptor that initiates binding. This mechanism is likely to be important for other receptors that bind to the A1 domain. The switch is also likely to be important for the function of VWF in hemostasis."

The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We induced C-type inactivation in BK channels and studied the relationship between activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery. We observed prominent slow C-type inactivation/recovery in BK channels by an extreme low concentration of extracellular K+ together with a Y294E/K/Q/S or Y279F mutation whose equivalent in Shaker channels (T449E/K/D/Q/S or W434F) caused a greatly accelerated rate of C-inactivation or constitutive C-inactivation.

In temperate regions, seasonal influenza outbreaks correlate with decreases in ambient humidity. While low humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes them more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

We find that it can avoid an excess mortality rate of 3.61 (2.96–4.21) million per year from outdoor air pollution worldwide. This could be up to 5.55 (4.52–6.52) million per year by additionally controlling nonfossil anthropogenic sources. Globally, fossil-fuel-related emissions account for about 65% of the excess mortality, and 70% of the climate cooling by anthropogenic aerosols. The chemical influence of air pollution on aeolian dust contributes to the aerosol cooling. Since aerosols mask the anthropogenic rise in global temperature, removing fossil-fuel-generated particles liberates 0.51(±0.03) °C and all pollution particles 0.73(±0.03) °C warming, reaching around 2 °C over North America and Northeast Asia. The steep temperature increase from removing aerosols can be moderated to about 0.36(±0.06) °C globally by the simultaneous reduction of tropospheric ozone and methane. We conclude that"

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, we find that women’s and men’s endorsement of hegemonic masculinity predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. In addition, as conceptualized, hegemonic masculinity predicted less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors. The findings highlight the importance of psychological examinations of masculinity as a cultural ideology to understand how men’s and women’s endorsement of hegemonic masculinity legitimizes patriarchal dominance and reinforces gender, race, and class-based hierarchies via candidate support. The findings have implications for understanding the political climate in the United States and beyond."

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. First, whereas MERS-CoV prefers human DPP4 over bat DPP4 as its receptor, HKU4 shows the opposite trend. Second, in the absence of exogenous proteases, both MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes mediate pseudovirus entry into bat cells, whereas only MERS-CoV spike, but not HKU4 spike, mediates pseudovirus entry into human cells.

Here, we report the development of an RNA polymerase ribozyme that can synthesize functional RNA molecules from RNA templates. This RNA polymerase ribozyme can synthesize a variety of RNA molecules, including aptamers, ribozymes, and even tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR.

This will be particularly important for the two most common causes of ALS, mutations in superoxide dismutase or hexanucleotide expansion in C9orf72. The method will also be applicable to other neurodegenerative diseases.

However, the mechanisms by which pathogens influence the microbiota are poorly understood. Here, we show that the bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum induces the tick Ixodes scapularis to express antifreeze glycoprotein (iafgp), which alters the gut microbiota and facilitates Anaplasma colonization. IAFGP binds the terminal d-alanine residue of the peptidoglycan cell wall of bacteria, resulting in altered permeability and the capacity of bacteria to form biofilms. These data elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which a human pathogen appropriates an antifreeze protein to alter the gut microbiota and more effectively colonize the vector. This work provides insights into the mechanisms by which pathogens influence the microbiota and may be relevant to the transmission of other pathogens by ticks and other arthropod vectors.

The discovery of Jinguofortis perplexus adds important information about the early evolution of the short-tailed bird group. Jinguofortisids are the earliest known members of the Pygostylia, a major clade of birds with a short tail ending in a compound bone termed “pygostyle.” The presence of a fused scapulocoracoid in adult individuals independently evolved in Jinguofortisidae and Confuciusornithiformes may relate to an accelerated osteogenesis during chondrogenesis and likely formed through the heterochronic process of peramorphosis by which these basal taxa retain the scapulocoracoid of the nonavian theropod ancestors with the addition of flight-related modifications. The discovery of Jinguofortis increases the known ecomorphological diversity of basal pygostylians and highlights the importance of developmental plasticity for understanding mosaic evolution in early birds.

In this study, we describe the biochemical basis of chlorosis in anurans (frogs and toads) and show that this phenomenon has evolved multiple times during their evolutionary history. We also describe a new function for a member of the serpin superfamily, the largest and most ubiquitous group of protease inhibitors.

We report that hypoxia induces expression of AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), a m6A demethylase, which increases NANOG mRNA levels and the percentage of breast cancer cells that possess CSC properties. ALKBH5 expression is induced by hypoxia through the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and HIF-2α pathways. NANOG mRNA methylation is decreased by ALKBH5, NANOG protein levels are increased, and NANOG-expressing cells become enriched for CSCs. Thus, ALKBH5 expression in response to hypoxia is a mechanism that promotes the emergence of CSCs in solid tumors. This mechanism may be relevant to the development of breast cancer metastasis.

Others have argued that it would not be possible to sustain herds if so many pocket Bibles were made from fetal skins, arguing instead for unexpected alternatives, such as rabbit. Here, we report a simple and objective method using standard conservation treatments to identify the animal origin of parchment. The noninvasive method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period.

The age model presented here is based on the U-Pb dating of volcanic ash beds that are part of the Global Stratotype Section and Point for the Permian-Triassic boundary.

We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action.

We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR).

Here, we introduce a deep learning algorithm that efficiently enhances antibody affinity to achieve broader and more potent neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a human antibody P36-5D2, which is effective against SARS-CoV-2 Alpha, Beta, and Gamma but not Delta. We show that our approach can identify CDR changes that alleviate the impact of two Omicron mutations on the epitope. These results highlight the power of our deep learning approach in antibody optimization and its potential application to engineering other protein molecules. Our optimized antibodies can potentially be developed into antibody drug candidates for current and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Our analysis reveals no significant differences in the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration between control and warmed plots in all biomes, with the exception of deserts and boreal forests. Thus, our data provide limited evidence of acclimation of soil respiration to experimental warming in several major biome types, contrary to the results from multiple single-site studies. Our analysis adds a unique cross-biome perspective on the temperature response of soil respiration, information critical to improving our mechanistic understanding of how soil carbon dynamics change with climatic warming.

The molecular signature of the transition from autotrophy to a nonphotosynthetic parasitic lifestyle is not well understood. We present a model of the trajectory of plastid genome evolution during the transition from autotrophy to a parasitic lifestyle. We show that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner. Our findings suggest that the molecular signature of the transition to obligate parasitism is not a single event but rather a gradual process. This model can be applied to other transitions in the evolution of life.

We use a high-resolution large ensemble to quantify the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the probability of occurrence of multiyear rainfall deficits in southwestern South Africa. We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% by the year 2100 under an intermediate-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5 [SSP2-4.5]) and to 80% under a high-emission scenario (SSP5-8.5). These results highlight the strong sensitivity of the drought risk in SSA to future anthropogenic emissions. This work is relevant to the ongoing debate on the role of human influence on the recent intensification of extreme droughts.

This reaction is catalyzed by two unrelated cyclase enzymes using different chemistries. The majority of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria use BchE, an O2-sensitive [4Fe-4S] cluster protein, whereas plants, cyanobacteria, and some phototrophic bacteria possess an O2-dependent enzyme, the major catalytic component of which is a diiron protein, AcsF.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. As an alternative approach, extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying the convergence of the targets and functions of the autism-risk genes to facilitate mapping out causal paths. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

We show that the proteins that form inclusions of mutant SOD1, TDP-43, and FUS are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. To explain the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in the brain and spinal cord, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues.

To better understand how MERS-CoV infects human cells, we engineered MERS viruses with mutations that blocked sequential proteolysis of the spike (S) glycoprotein. These mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past cell-surface proteases and into endosomes, whereas precleaved MERS viruses used endosomal fusion-activating proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry. Uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases.

These results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities. Our results also suggest that the physical appearance of neighborhoods is a key determinant of their economic success. This is an important contribution to the literature on urban economics and urban sociology. Our results also have implications for the design of urban policies.

The loss of the zooxanthellae is a defense mechanism of the coral, but it also exposes the coral to a range of pathogens and predators. We show that the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis is a consequence of the altered nutrient cycling of the coral host. The catabolism of amino acids during heat stress increases the metabolic energy demand of the coral host, which is compensated by the degradation of amino acids. The resulting shift from net uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont subsequently promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host. This study provides a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

In this study, we investigate the consequences of tumorigenesis on the microbiome using a Drosophila intestinal tumor model. We show that upon loss of BMP signaling, tumors lead to aberrant activation of JNK/Mmp2 signaling, followed by intestinal barrier dysfunction and commensal imbalance. In turn, the dysbiotic microbiome triggers a regenerative response and stimulates tumor growth. We find that inhibiting JNK signaling or depletion of the microbiome restores barrier function of the intestinal epithelium, leading to a reestablishment of host–microbe homeostasis, and organismic lifespan extension. Our experiments identify a JNK-dependent feedback amplification loop between intestinal tumors and the microbiome. They also highlight the importance of controlling the activity level of JNK signaling to maintain epithelial barrier function and host–microbe homeostasis.

In mammals, this ability is lost during development, and the adult CNS is incapable of regenerating. Here, we identify a form of regeneration that is remarkably independent of the canonical MAPK signaling pathway known to mediate regeneration in the adult mammalian CNS. This DLK-independent regeneration is triggered by physical lesion of the sensory dendrite or mutations disrupting sensory activity, calcium signaling, or genes that restrict outgrowth during neuronal maturation. These connections suggest that DLK-independent regeneration represents a powerful platform for gene discovery in neuronal regeneration. Moreover, we note numerous similarities between DLK-independent regeneration and lesion conditioning, a phenomenon producing robust regeneration in the mammalian CNS. Taken as a whole, our study unites disparate forms of neuronal outgrowth to uncover fresh molecular insights into activity-dependent control of the adult nervous system’s intrinsic regenerative capacity. This work provides a unique platform for the discovery of genes that control the adult nervous system’s intrinsic regenerative capacity.

We found that the dominant resting metabolic network in healthy subjects was topographically similar to the default mode network. In contrast, in Parkinson’s disease, this dominant network was subordinated to an independent disease-related pattern. Network functionality was assessed by quantifying metabolic RSN expression in cerebral blood flow PET scans acquired at rest and during task performance. We observed that the default mode network was deactivated during rest in healthy subjects and early Parkinson’s disease, and that this abnormality was partially corrected by dopaminergic therapy.

We found that grid cells, which are thought to be the main neurons forming the space map, are strongly coupled among themselves but weakly coupled to other cell types. These findings suggest that grid cells might form a distinct space map from that of other neurons. Our results also suggest that the space map formed by grid cells might be more robust to noise and more efficient in guiding navigation. This study provides a detailed view of the space map formed by MEC neurons and opens up new avenues for understanding the function of the space map. (Show more)"

We demonstrate that striatonigral fibers originating in striosomes form highly unusual bouquet-like arborizations that target bundles of ventrally extending dopamine-containing dendrites and clusters of their parent nigral cell bodies. These clustered cell bodies in turn project to the striatum as part of the classic nigrostriatal pathway. Thus, these striosome–dendron bouquets likely represent subsystems with the nigro–striato–nigral loop that are affected in human disorders including Parkinson’s disease. Given evidence that striosomes receive input from cortical regions related to the control of mood and motivation and that they link functionally to reinforcement and decision-making, the striosome–dendron bouquets could be critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease. This work provides a detailed description of the morphology of the striatonigral system and its implications for understanding the function of this system in health and disease.

We found that the speed at which people respond to each other is a robust predictor of how connected they feel. This response speed is not controlled by the person who is responding, but rather is a signal of the person who is responding. This response speed is used by third-party listeners to predict how connected two people are. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

SAN cells (SANCs) are responsible for generating the heart rate and are characterized by unique electrophysiological properties. SAN automaticity is regulated by the store-operated Ca2+ entry pathway, which is mediated by stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and Orai1 channels. Cardiac-specific deletion of STIM1 in mice resulted in depletion of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ stores of SANCs and led to SAN dysfunction, as was evident by a reduction in heart rate, sinus arrest, and an exaggerated autonomic response to cholinergic signaling. Moreover, STIM1 influenced SAN function by regulating ionic fluxes in SANCs, including activation of a store-operated Ca2+ current, a reduction in L-type Ca2+ current, and enhancing the activities of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. These studies reveal that STIM1 is a multifunctional regulator of Ca2+ dynamics in SANCs that links SR Ca2+ store content with electrical events occurring in the plasma membrane, thereby contributing to automaticity of the SAN.

This is due to the cell wall, which is absent in mammalian cells and poses the dominant physical barrier to biomolecule delivery in plants. Herein, we report a systematic assessment of different DNA nanostructures for their ability to internalize into cells of mature plants, deliver siRNAs, and effectively silence a constitutively expressed gene in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. We show that nanostructure internalization into plant cells and corresponding gene silencing efficiency depends on the nanostructure size, shape, compactness, stiffness, and location of the siRNA attachment locus on the nanostructure. We further confirm that the internalization efficiency of DNA nanostructures correlates with their respective gene silencing efficiencies but that the endogenous gene silencing pathway depends on the siRNA attachment locus. Our work establishes the feasibility of biomolecule delivery to plants with DNA nanostructures and both details the design parameters of importance for plant cell internalization and also assesses the impact of DNA nanostructure geometry for gene silencing mechanisms.

However, certification had no causal impact on deforestation in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation.

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We hypothesize that the unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. Our findings highlight the need for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. This could help reduce the environmental footprint of modern agriculture and mitigate the risk of subsoil compaction, which is a major threat to soil productivity. This would be particularly relevant in the context of climate change, which is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events. Our findings also have implications for the study of the evolution of animal behavior and the role of ecological factors in shaping the behavior of prehistoric animals. Overall, our work highlights the importance of considering the ecological context in the study of"
