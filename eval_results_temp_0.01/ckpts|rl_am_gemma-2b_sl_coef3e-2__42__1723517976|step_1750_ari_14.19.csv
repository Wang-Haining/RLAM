Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of the proton channel, the voltage-gated H+ channel (Hv1). We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low-anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as decreased ATP and increased ROS production in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals. We conclude that mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens is crucial for social behavior and is critically involved in the low social competitiveness associated with high anxiety.

This problem can be addressed by the development of new antibacterial agents to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. Here, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The predicted best candidate is synthetically more accessible, exhibits higher solubility and binding affinity to the ribosome, and is up to 56 times more active against resistant pathogens than telithromycin.

However, the number of trainable parameters in these networks is often large, and the networks are difficult to train and apply in practice. Here, we introduce a network architecture based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters, and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data."

However, T cells from CTLA-4–deficient inducible KO mice were able to adoptively transfer the diseases into T cell-deficient mice. Notably, cell transfer of thymocytes de novo produced myocarditis, otherwise not observed in donor mice depleted in adulthood. Moreover, CTLA-4 deficiency affects both central and peripheral tolerance and Treg cell-mediated suppression.

Our analyses resolved previously controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, plant cell wall-degrading enzymes obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, these novel genes triggered adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding PCWDEs."

The presence of two copies of the E4 allele increases risk by ∼12-fold whereas E2 allele is associated with an ∼twofold decreased risk for AD. These data put APOE central to AD pathophysiology, but it is not yet clear how APOE alleles modify AD risk. Here, we report a novel role for APOE in controlling the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes.

We address this paradox by showing that the instability of DL is due to the fact that current DL methods typically use a single algorithm, stochastic gradient descent, which is unstable in well-conditioned problems. We introduce a new algorithm, fast iterative restarted networks, which we prove and numerically verify to be stable. Moreover, we prove that only O(|log (ϵ)|) layers are needed for an ϵ-accurate solution to the well-conditioned problem. Our results provide a classification theory of stability for neural networks.

K+ channels commonly possess two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. These findings provide a new perspective on the regulation of K+ channels and may help us understand the physiological roles of K+ channels. (PsycINFO Database Record"

Here, we show that mice housed in low humidity are more susceptible to severe disease following influenza virus challenge. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide insights into the impact of ambient humidity on the severity of influenza virus infection and may help to develop strategies to mitigate the impact of influenza virus outbreaks.

We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA."

Here, we introduce a deep learning algorithm that efficiently enhances antibody affinity to achieve broader and more potent neutralizing activity against such variants. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a human antibody P36-5D2, which is effective against SARS-CoV-2 Alpha, Beta, and Gamma but not Delta. We show that our approach can identify CDR changes that alleviate the impact of two Omicron mutations on the epitope. These results highlight the power of our deep learning approach in antibody optimization and its potential application to engineering other protein molecules. Our optimized antibodies can potentially be developed into antibody drug candidates for current and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. This work has the potential to accelerate the development of new antibody-based therapeutics to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. (Read more)"

Our analysis provides limited evidence of acclimation of soil respiration to experimental warming in several major biome types, and demonstrates that rising global temperatures may result in regionally variable responses in soil respiration, with colder climates being considerably more responsive to increased ambient temperatures compared with warmer regions. Our results highlight the need for further research to understand the mechanisms underlying the observed variability in the response of soil respiration to warming.

To better understand the role of the spike (S) glycoproteins in MERS-CoV infection, we introduced mutations that blocked the sequential cleavage of S proteins. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence.

This is a simple and low-cost intervention that could be implemented in a wide range of settings, including schools, hospitals, and workplaces. The results suggest that increasing the proportion of vegetarian meals available could lead to proportional increases in vegetarian meal sales of 61.8%, 78.8%, and 40.8% in the three largest categories of meals sold in a cafeteria: hot meals, sandwiches, and salads. These proportional increases in vegetarian meal sales would be achieved with little impact on overall sales and without rebound effects. The results also suggest that the effect of increasing the proportion of vegetarian meals available is largest among diners with the lowest levels of vegetarian meal selection. This suggests that the intervention may be most effective when targeting people who are least likely to make a change in their own behavior.

Chemotherapy is the most common treatment for breast cancer, but resistance to chemotherapy is common, and the response to chemotherapy is variable. In this study, we show that the expression of the type I tyrosine kinaselike orphan receptor ROR1 is increased in breast cancer cells following treatment with chemotherapy, and that this expression correlates with the capacity of breast cancer cells to metastasize and reengraft mice. Furthermore, we show that the humanized anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab can repress the expression of genes associated with breast cancer stemness, reduce the activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or BMI1, and impair the capacity of breast cancer PDXs to metastasize or reengraft mice. These results indicate that targeting ROR1 may improve the response to chemotherapy of patients with breast cancer. (PsycINFO Database Record"

Cardiac-specific deletion of STIM1 in mice resulted in depletion of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ stores of SAN cells and led to SAN dysfunction, as was evident by a reduction in heart rate, sinus arrest, and an exaggerated autonomic response to cholinergic signaling. Moreover, STIM1 influenced SAN function by regulating ionic fluxes in SAN cells, including activation of a store-operated Ca2+ current, a reduction in L-type Ca2+ current, and enhancing the activities of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger.

This relationship is important because it explains how the presence of antibodies can cause changes in the brain’s electrical activity, which can lead to seizures. This understanding may help in the development of new treatments for this disease."

However, the history of C perturbations during abrupt warming events is poorly understood. Here, we present a multiproxy approach to investigate a major C perturbation and global warming event (∼304 Ma) that occurred during a paleo-glacial state. We show that the event was linked to an injection of organic matter–derived C and to an increase in nutrient fluxes. Modeling indicates that the event was linked to enhanced thermocline stratification and increased nutrient fluxes during an icehouse. This work provides insights into the history of C perturbations during abrupt warming events and the potential impacts of such events on the Earth system."

We show that RSPO certification reduces deforestation in Indonesia, but that most certified areas contain little residual forest. Our results suggest that certification is not yet having the intended impact on reducing deforestation, and that certification is not yet having the intended impact on reducing forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection. We conclude that certification is not yet having the intended impact on reducing deforestation, and that certification is not yet having the intended impact on reducing forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection."

In humans, its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. In this study, we discovered a small molecule that can inhibit the exocytosis process in both plant and human cells. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

In this study, we investigate the effects of multiple interacting sex determination alleles on the evolution of secondary sexual characteristics in a fish species. We find that the interplay of multiple sex determination alleles in a species can produce modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics, and that the evolution of a new sex determination allele can produce additional axes of variation. These results provide context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations. This work also provides a framework for understanding the evolution of secondary sexual characteristics in other species. (Show more)"

We sought to understand the role of iron in the retina and found that iron levels impact the retina in a manner that is distinct from the effects of vitamin A. We also found that iron levels impact the health of the retina in a manner that is distinct from the effects of vitamin A. These findings have implications for the retina and other tissues challenged by high levels of vitamin A and reactive oxygen species. They also suggest that iron may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of retinal diseases.

However, the evolution of specialization is often considered a dead end, as it is associated with morphological and functional changes throughout the organism. Here we show that the evolution of specialization in siphonophores is not a dead end, but rather a stepping stone to morphological diversification and diversification of prey types. These findings help us understand the evolution of specialization and morphological diversification in predators, and the role of specialization in the functioning of ecosystems."

This study provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key derived feature of the human hand, the third metacarpal styloid process, and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus. This finding has implications for the evolution of the human hand and the emergence of modern human-like tool use. It also provides a unique opportunity to compare the anatomy of the hand of a Neandertalian with that of a modern human."

SHMT converts serine into glycine and a tetrahydrofolate-bound one-carbon unit. In this study, we identify a small-molecule inhibitor of SHMT, and show that it blocks tumor growth in a mouse model of colon cancer. We also show that the one-carbon donor formate is a potent rescue of SHMT inhibition, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in a cancer cell-line screen. Finally, we show that defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a cancer type that is particularly sensitive to SHMT inhibition. These results provide a foundation for the development of SHMT inhibitors as a new class of cancer therapeutics."

The results have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. The results also highlight the need for more research on the role of natural landscapes in improving people’s diets, particularly in rural areas of low- and middle-income countries."

The use of farm machinery has greatly increased the capacity of agricultural land, but the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We also show that the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods."
