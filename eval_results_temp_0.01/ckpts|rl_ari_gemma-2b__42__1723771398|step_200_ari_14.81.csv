In this work, we report the synthesis and in situ neutron diffraction study of neon hydrate at high pressure and low temperature. The structure of neon hydrate is found to be ice II-like, in which neon atoms are enclathrated in water molecules. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The resolved structure where Ne dissolved in ice II is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. The vibration of Ne atoms is mainly in planes perpendicular to D2O channels, whereas their distributions along the channels are further constrained by interactions between adjacent Ne atoms. The results provide a new insight into the structure and properties of hydrate ice. This work also demonstrates that in situ neutron diffraction can be used to study the structure of hydrate ice at high pressure and low temperature. The results are expected to be of great significance in the study of hydrate ice in the ocean and the environment. The results are also expected to provide a new insight into the structure and"

Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. To gain insight into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite, we compared the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insights into the origin of parasitic lifestyles and the evolution of the parasite genome. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED) Copyright 2017 Federation of European Biochemical Societies."

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We found that SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 evades the host antiviral response and may provide a target for the development of new antiviral strategies.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. Sperm cells are quiescent in the male reproductive system due to Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1 channels, but become active once introduced into the low-Zn2+-concentration environment of the female reproductive tract. How Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide"

This instability in global grain trade and international grain prices will affect especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. We quantify the magnitude of this instability by projecting how the coefficient of variation of maize yields will change in the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. We find that the probability that they have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming. Our results underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance. They also portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammalian herbivores (six wild, one domestic) in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in body size and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages. Our results highlight the importance of diet composition in determining trophic interactions and biodiversity in herbivore communities. This study also demonstrates the utility of DNA metabarcoding for quantifying diet breadth and composition in large herbivore communities.

Many businesses expect the crisis to last for many months, but they are uncertain about the length of the crisis. Finally, many businesses plan to apply for the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act loans, but anticipate problems with accessing the program. We also assess the effects of the CARES Act loans relative to grants. Our results suggest that grants are more effective at increasing business resilience than loans.

However, the magnitude and the fate of this pollution are still open questions. Using data from the Malaspina 2010 circumnavigation, regional surveys, and previously published reports, we show a worldwide distribution of plastic on the surface of the open ocean, mostly accumulating in the convergence zones of each of the five subtropical gyres with comparable density. However, the global load of plastic on the open ocean surface was estimated to be on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean. We suggest that the use of the term “plastic soup” is misleading and should be avoided. We propose to use the term “floating plastic debris” instead."

The effective CPUE of most countries has decreased since 1950, showing the increasing pressure of fisheries on ocean resources. The effective CPUE of most countries in 2015 was a fifth of its 1950s value, which was compared with a global decline in abundance. There are signs, however, of stabilization and more effective management in recent years, with a reduction in fleet sizes in developed countries. Based on historical patterns and allowing for the slowing rate of expansion, 1 million more motorized vessels could join the global fleet by midcentury as developing countries continue to transition away from subsistence fisheries. This would challenge sustainable use of fisheries' resources. We recommend a reduction in the size of the global fleet to avoid overfishing. We also recommend that the global fleet should be reduced to a sustainable level by 2030. This would allow for the recovery of overfished stocks and the maintenance of the ecosystem services provided by the oceans.

It controls vascular contractility, hemostasis, and inflammation and regulates the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products between circulating blood and tissue. To control each function, the endothelium processes endlessly arriving requests from multiple sources using separate clusters of cells specialized to detect specific stimuli. A well-developed but poorly understood communication system operates between cells to integrate multiple lines of information and coordinate endothelial responses. Here, the nature of the communication network has been addressed using single-cell Ca2+ imaging across thousands of endothelial cells in intact blood vessels. Cell activities were cross-correlated and compared to a stochastic model to determine network connections. Highly correlated Ca2+ activities occurred in scattered cell clusters, and network communication links between them exhibited unexpectedly short path lengths. The small-world configuration confers particularly dynamic endothelial properties including high signal-propagation speed, stability, and a high degree of synchronizability. Local activation of small clusters of cells revealed that the short path lengths and rapid signal transmission were achieved by shortcuts via connecting extensions to nonlocal cells.

We have identified the second Threonine residue within the TTVGYGD signature sequence of K+ channels as a crucial residue for this allosteric communication. A Threonine to Alanine substitution at this position was studied in three representative members of the K+-channel family. Interestingly, all of the mutant channels exhibited lack of C-type inactivation gating and an inversion of their allosteric coupling (i.e., closing of the activation gate collapses the channel’s selectivity filter). A state-dependent crystallographic study of KcsA-T75A proves that, on activation, the selectivity filter transitions from a nonconductive and deep C-type inactivated conformation to a conductive one. Finally, we provide a crystallographic demonstration that closed-state inactivation can be achieved by the structural collapse of the channel’s selectivity filter.

Here we show that trait anxiety directly influences social dominance in male outbred rats and identify an important mediating role for mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens. High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low-anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as decreased ATP and increased ROS production in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals. We conclude that mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens is crucial for social hierarchy establishment and is critically involved in the low social competitiveness associated with high anxiety.

However, the use of a single material phase and heuristically developed structural patterns leads to restricted design space and potential failure to achieve specific target behaviors. Here, through a free-form inverse design approach, multiple hyperelastic materials with distinct properties are optimally synthesized into composite structures to precisely achieve arbitrary and extreme prescribed responses under large deformations. The digitally synthesized structures exhibit organic shapes and motions with irregular distributions of material phases. Within the structures, different materials play distinct roles yet seamlessly collaborate through sophisticated deformation mechanisms to produce the target behaviors. While complex in geometry and material heterogeneity, the discovered structures are effectively manufactured via multimaterial fabrication with different polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomers with distinct behaviors and their highly nonlinear responses are physically and accurately realized in experiments. To enhance programmability, the synthesized structures are heteroassembled into architectures that exhibit highly complex yet navigable responses. The proposed synthesis, multimaterial fabrication, and heteroassembly strategy can be utilized to design function-oriented and situation-specific mechanical devices for a wide range of applications. The proposed approach can be extended to design other types of complex structures with programmable responses. This work provides a general"

Here we investigated the role of the insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) in this process. We found that IGF2BP1 is expressed in human erythroid tissues and is down-regulated in fetal liver compared with adult bone marrow. IGF2BP1 overexpression in erythroid cells causes a nearly complete reversal of the adult pattern of hemoglobin expression toward a more fetal-like phenotype. This phenotype is associated with reduced BCL11A protein levels and increased fetal hemoglobin levels. These results suggest a mechanism for chronoregulation of fetal and adult hemoglobin expression in humans. The results also suggest that IGF2BP1 may be a therapeutic target for hemoglobinopathies. This study provides a potential mechanism for the chronoregulation of hemoglobin expression in humans. The results also suggest that IGF2BP1 may be a therapeutic target for hemoglobinopathies.

In this study, we found that activating mutation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) function, highly frequent events in human cancer, confers ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells. This resistance requires sustained activation of mTORC1 and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)C1-dependent induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. Genetic or pharmacologic ablation of SREBP1 or stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) sensitized ferroptosis in cancer cells with PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway mutation. Conversely, ectopic expression of SREBP1 or SCD1 restored ferroptosis resistance in these cells, even when mTORC1 was inhibited.

We used &gt;25 years of bird surveys to test whether the NWFP’s policy of reducing clearcutting and increasing old-growth-like forests stabilized populations of older-forest–associated birds and reversed declines of early-seral–associated birds. Our results show that the NWFP halted declines of early-seral–associated birds, but failed to reverse declines of older-forest–associated birds. Our findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure. We also show that the NWFP’s policy of reducing clearcutting and increasing old-growth-like forests has been insufficient to reverse declines of older-forest–associated bird populations. Our findings are important for understanding the influence of policy on biodiversity. They also provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the influence of policy.

Computational approaches are essential tools to this end since their application enables fast and early strategical decisions in the drug development process. Here, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. Our results demonstrate the potential of rational design to identify new antibiotics with improved properties. This approach can be extended to other antibiotic classes.

Participants reading an LE-eBook took longer to fall asleep and had reduced evening sleepiness, reduced melatonin secretion, later timing of their circadian clock, and reduced next-morning alertness than when reading a printed book. These results demonstrate that evening exposure to an LE-eBook phase-delays the circadian clock, acutely suppresses melatonin, and has important implications for understanding the impact of such technologies on sleep, performance, health, and safety.

CTLA-4 deletion induced preferential expansion of Treg cells, but T cells from CTLA-4–deficient mice were able to induce the diseases in T cell-deficient mice. CTLA-4 deletion had opposing impacts on different autoimmune models. Thus, although CTLA-4 deficiency affects both central and peripheral tolerance, it has a more severe impact on autoimmunity in the periphery. These findings indicate that CTLA-4 is essential for the development of autoimmunity in adult mice. Furthermore, the opposing effects of CTLA-4 deletion on different autoimmune models suggest that CTLA-4 may have different functions in different autoimmune diseases.

We used a comprehensive dataset of 154 beetle genomes and transcriptomes to trace the evolution of genes enabling symbiont-independent digestion of lignocellulose, the major component of plant cell walls. Phylogenomic analyses of these uniquely comprehensive datasets resolved previously controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, both major independent origins of specialized herbivory in beetles coincide with the first appearances of an arsenal of PCWDEs encoded in their genomes. Beetle diversity thus appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding PCWDEs.

In marijuana abusers, DA responses in ventral striatum were also inversely correlated with addiction severity and craving. The attenuated responses to MP, including reduced decreases in striatal DVs, are consistent with decreased brain reactivity to the DA stimulation in marijuana abusers that might contribute to their negative emotionality (increased stress reactivity and irritability) and addictive behaviors.

How these unique properties of human cognition and brain are related remains unclear. Here, we use a large-scale, integrative modeling approach to show that the most powerful artificial neural networks predict neural and behavioral responses to spoken sentences with nearly 100% of explainable variance. These models’ neural fits and fits to behavioral responses are both correlated with their accuracy on a challenging language task. These results provide computational evidence that predictive processing fundamentally shapes the language comprehension mechanisms in the human brain. They also suggest that the language comprehension system is well-suited for predictive coding. This view is supported by recent findings that the human brain is particularly good at predicting the future from sensory inputs. Together, these findings provide a unifying account of the human language system as a predictive processor. They also suggest that the human brain is uniquely adapted to process language. Future work should investigate whether this view generalizes to other domains. If so, it could provide a new perspective on the evolution of the human brain. It could also lead to computational models of language that are more accurate and more biologically plausible. Finally, it could lead to computational tools for"

However, there is a fundamental paradox: DL methods typically suffer from instability, even when universal approximation properties guarantee the existence of stable neural networks (NNs). We address this paradox by demonstrating that there are cases where there exists a deterministic training algorithm that computes a NN with a given accuracy, but any such (even randomized) algorithm needs arbitrarily many training data. These results imply a classification theory describing conditions under which (stable) NNs with a given accuracy can be computed by an algorithm. We introduce fast iterative restarted networks (FIRENETs), which we both prove and numerically verify are stable. Moreover, we prove that only O(|log (ϵ)|) layers are needed for an ϵ-accurate solution to the inverse problem. Our results are a step toward understanding the stability of deep learning."

However, M. leprae has accumulated 50% more pseudogenes than M. lepromatosis, and both have retained functions required to cause disease in the peripheral nervous system. Phylogenetic comparisons suggest that M. lepromatosis is closer to the MRCA than M. leprae, and a Bayesian dating analysis suggests that they diverged from their MRCA approximately 13.9 Mya.

Recently, the study of quantum quenches revealed that these concepts are intricately intertwined. Although the unitary time evolution ensuing from a pure state maintains the system at zero entropy, local properties at long times are captured by a statistical ensemble with nonzero thermodynamic entropy, which is the entanglement accumulated during the dynamics. Therefore, understanding the entanglement evolution unveils how thermodynamics emerges in isolated systems. Alas, an exact computation of the entanglement dynamics was available so far only for noninteracting systems, whereas it was deemed unfeasible for interacting ones. Here, we show that the standard quasiparticle picture of the entanglement evolution, complemented with integrability-based knowledge of the steady state and its excitations, leads to a complete understanding of the entanglement dynamics in the space–time scaling limit. We thoroughly check our result for the paradigmatic Heisenberg chain. Our work opens the door to the study of the entanglement dynamics in interacting systems. It also provides a general framework for the study of the entanglement dynamics in quantum field theory. This is a major step toward the understanding of the emergence of thermodynamics in isolated quantum systems. It also provides a general framework for the study of"

The vector of the disease is still debated, with rodent and human ectoparasite vectors being proposed. Here, we present a compartmental model for plague transmission by a human ectoparasite vector. Using Bayesian inference, we found that this model fits mortality curves from nine outbreaks in Europe better than models for pneumonic or rodent transmission. Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346–1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats. This study also provides a framework for studying the historical spread of plague in Europe. Future studies should test the model’s ability to reproduce outbreaks in other regions. This would allow for a better understanding of the interplay between human and rodent vectors and the spread of plague in Europe during the Second Pandemic. This is relevant to the current debate on the origin of the plague bacillus, which is thought to have been carried by rats.

However, to get a less biased picture of the evolutionary paths leading to high cognitive power, we need to compare brains not by mass but by numbers of neurons, which are their basic computational units. This study reconstructs the evolution of brains across amniotes by directly analyzing neuron numbers by using the largest dataset of its kind and including essential data on reptiles. We show that reptiles have not only small brains relative to body size but also low neuronal densities, resulting in average neuron numbers over 20 times lower than those in birds and mammals of similar body size. Amniote brain evolution is characterized by the following four major shifts in neuron–brain scaling. The most dramatic increases in brain neurons occurred independently with the appearance of birds and mammals, resulting in convergent neuron scaling in the two endotherm lineages. The other two major increases in the number of neurons happened in core land birds and anthropoid primates, which are two groups known for their cognitive prowess. Interestingly, relative brain size is associated with relative neuronal cell density in reptiles, birds, and primates but not in other mammals. This has important implications for studies using relative brain size as a"

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal and transformed cells is more complex than previously appreciated. We have shown that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 may act as a tumor suppressor in some settings. These data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. Future studies will be needed to determine whether TRAP1-based therapies can be developed for cancer treatment. Such studies will require the development of TRAP1-specific inhibitors. Such inhibitors may be useful as probes of TRAP1 function in mitochondria of normal and transformed cells. They may also be useful in the development of TRAP1-based cancer therapies.

It is thought to sever actin filaments, but the mechanism by which it does so is unknown. Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to monitor and quantify the action of ADF in different mechanical situations. We find that ADF binds to actin filaments and that local curvature favors severing, while tension has no effect on cofilin binding and weakly enhances severing. We also find that filament segments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist, experience a mechanical torque upon cofilin binding. We propose that this ADF-induced torque increases the severing rate constant 100-fold. A consequence of this mechanism is that cross-linked filament networks are severed by cofilin far more efficiently than nonconnected filaments. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. Our findings provide a molecular understanding of how ADF/cofilin’s severing activity is regulated in cells. Our results also provide a general framework for understanding how mechanical forces can enhance the activity of other molecular motors. This framework can be"

This study compared the effects of fructose versus glucose on brain, hormone, and appetitive responses to food cues and food-approach behavior. We found that fructose relative to glucose resulted in greater brain reactivity to food cues and greater hunger and desire for food. These findings suggest that fructose may be a weaker suppressor of appetite than glucose. The greater brain reactivity to food cues observed in the visual cortex and left orbital frontal cortex may promote attention to food cues and food-approach behavior. The greater hunger and desire for food and willingness to give up long-term monetary rewards to obtain immediate high-calorie foods may promote food intake. These findings have implications for understanding the effects of sugar-sweetened beverages on appetite and food-seeking behavior.

Admixture and demographic growth happened recently, suggesting a rapid settlement of Madagascar during the last millennium. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the settlement was not homogeneous, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, we find that a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. This study provides a comprehensive view of the settlement history of Madagascar.

Although emotional contagion has been well established in laboratory experiments, the results are controversial when applied to real-world social networks. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others’ positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.

This paper tests the hypothesis that the evolution of an aquatic lifestyle is driving three of the four extant aquatic mammal clades toward a size attractor. We use published data on the body masses of 3,859 living and 2,999 fossil mammal species to examine the evolutionary trajectories of body size in aquatic mammals. Both methods indicate that the evolution of an aquatic lifestyle is driving three of the four extant aquatic mammal clades toward a size attractor at ∼500 kg. The existence of this body size attractor and the relatively rapid selection toward, and limited deviation from, this attractor rule out most hypothesized drivers of size increase. These three independent body size increases and a shared aquatic optimum size are consistent with control by differences in the scaling of energetic intake and cost functions with body size between the terrestrial and aquatic realms. Under this energetic model, thermoregulatory costs constrain minimum size, whereas limitations on feeding efficiency constrain maximum size. The optimum size occurs at an intermediate value where thermoregulatory costs are low but feeding efficiency remains high. Rather than being released from size pressures, water-dwelling mammals are driven and confined to"

To understand the mechanism of temperature-dependent growth, we compared the transcriptional response of primary mouse airway epithelial cells infected with rhinovirus at 33 °C vs. 37 °C. We found that mouse airway cells infected with mouse-adapted rhinovirus exhibited a striking enrichment in expression of antiviral defense response genes at 37 °C relative to 33 °C, which correlated with significantly higher expression levels of type I and type III IFN genes and ISGs at 37 °C. Temperature-dependent IFN induction in response to rhinovirus was dependent on the MAVS protein, a key signaling adaptor of the RIG-I–like receptors (RLRs). Stimulation of primary airway cells with the synthetic RLR ligand poly I:C led to greater IFN induction at 37 °C relative to 33 °C at early time points poststimulation and to a sustained increase in the induction of ISGs at 37 °C relative to 33 °C.

It is able to cause infections by producing a variety of virulence factors, including toxins, proteases, and biofilm-inducing molecules. Here we show that P. aeruginosa uses its type IV pili to sense surfaces and to regulate its virulence. Type IV pili are major surface adhesins, and their activity is required for surface sensing. The pili-mediated surface sensing pathway requires attachment of type IV pili to a solid surface, followed by pilus retraction and signal transduction through the Chp chemosensory system, a chemotaxis-like sensory system that regulates cAMP production and transcription of hundreds of genes, including key virulence factors. The methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein-like chemosensor PilJ directly interacts with the major pilin subunit PilA. Our results thus support a mechanochemical model where a chemosensory system measures the mechanically induced conformational changes in stretched type IV pili. These findings demonstrate that P. aeruginosa uses type IV pili for both twitching motility and as a sensor regulating its virulence.

The results of our faunal analysis demonstrate that the Hellenistic (fourth–second centuries B.C.E.) site of Maresha, Israel, is the earliest site known today where economic exploitation of chickens was widely practiced. We base our claim on the exceptionally high frequency of chicken bones at that site, the majority of which belong to adult individuals, and on the observed 2:1 ratio of female to male bones. These results are supported further by an extensive survey of faunal remains from 234 sites in the Southern Levant, spanning more than three millennia, which shows a sharp increase in the frequency of chicken during the Hellenistic period. We further argue that the earliest secure evidence for economic exploitation of chickens in Europe dates to the first century B.C.E. and therefore is predated by the finds in the Southern Levant by at least a century. We suggest that the gradual acclimatization of chickens in the Southern Levant and its gradual integration into the local economy, the latter fully accomplished in the Hellenistic period, was a crucial step in the adoption of this species in European husbandry some 100 y later."

The predominant Np4 decapping enzyme in proteobacteria, ApaH, is inactivated by the very conditions of disulfide stress that enable Np4-capped RNAs to accumulate to high levels. Here, we show that, in cells experiencing such stress, the pyrophosphohydrolase RppH assumes a leading role in decapping those transcripts, preferring them as substrates over their triphosphorylated and diphosphorylated counterparts. The unique manner in which capped substrates of this kind bind to the active site of RppH positions the δ-phosphate, rather than the β-phosphate, for hydrolytic attack, generating triphosphorylated RNA as the primary product of decapping. This study reveals a previously unrecognized mechanism for how a bacterial enzyme recognizes and deprotects capped RNA termini. The unconventional manner in which RppH recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during"

Mutations in VWF cause the common bleeding disorder, von Willebrand disease (VWD). The A1 domain in VWF binds to platelet glycoprotein Ibα (GPIbα) on platelets, in a reaction triggered, in part, by alterations in flow during bleeding. Gain-of-function mutations in A1 and GPIbα in VWD suggest conformational regulation. We report that force application switches A1 and/or GPIbα to a second state with faster on-rate, providing a mechanism for activating VWF binding to platelets. Switching occurs near 10 pN, a force that also induces a state of the receptor−ligand complex with slower off-rate. Force greatly increases the effects of VWD mutations, explaining pathophysiology.

Here, we introduce the dual-field-of-view (FOV) high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) for simultaneously profiling aerosol and water cloud properties, especially water cloud microphysical properties. The HSRL was used to conduct continuous observations of aerosols and clouds over Beijing, China, to investigate the interactions between aerosol loading and water cloud microphysical properties. The observations show that increased aerosol loading led to increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius—consistent with expectations—but had no discernible increase on liquid water path. This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations obtained from the HSRL constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI process.

The ancestral environmental temperatures thereby determined for these photic-zone organisms––shown in modern taxa to correlate strongly with NDK thermostability––are inferred to reflect ancient surface-environment paleotemperatures.

We induced C-type inactivation in BK channels and studied the relationship between activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery. We observed prominent slow C-type inactivation/recovery in BK channels by an extreme low concentration of extracellular K+ together with a Y294E/K/Q/S or Y279F mutation whose equivalent in Shaker channels (T449E/K/D/Q/S or W434F) caused a greatly accelerated rate of C-inactivation or constitutive C-inactivation.

Here, we show that the malaria parasite’s erythrocyte-binding antigen, EBA175, alters the biophysical properties of the RBC membrane, reducing the energy barrier to invasion. We show that the parasite’s binding to GPA on the RBC surface leads to an increase in the cytoskeletal tension of the red cell and a reduction in the bending modulus of the cell’s membrane. These changes in the RBC are correlated with parasite invasion efficiency. This finding would suggest that the malaria parasite primes the erythrocyte surface through its binding antigens, altering the biophysical nature of the target cell and thus reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion. This would constitute a major change in our concept of malaria parasite invasion, suggesting it is, in fact, a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces working together to facilitate entry. This work provides a new perspective on the malaria parasite’s invasion of the human red blood cell. It also provides a potential target for the development of new antimalarial drugs.

It is a semiconductor with a wide bandgap of 5.54 eV, which limits its applications. Here, we show that diamond can be metallized reversibly under mechanical strain. We demonstrate that metallization can be achieved by strain-induced bandgap collapse, which is accompanied by a softening of the optical phonons. We also show that the metallization process is accompanied by a phase transition from diamond to graphite. Our findings offer opportunities for tailoring properties of diamond via strain engineering for electronic, photonic, and quantum applications.

In temperate regions, seasonal influenza outbreaks correlate with decreases in ambient humidity. While low humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes them more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the impact of low humidity on influenza virus infection and disease outcome. They also suggest that low humidity may be a modifiable risk factor for influenza virus infection. Our study provides a rationale for the use of low humidity as a"

We study a community monitoring program that facilitated transfer of early deforestation alerts from the Global Forest Watch network to indigenous communities in the Peruvian Amazon and trained and incentivized community members to patrol forests in response to those alerts. Our results suggest that the program reduced tree cover loss, but the estimated effects from the experiment are imprecise. Community members perceived that the program’s monitors were new authorities with influence over forest management and that the monitors’ incentivized patrols were substitutes for traditional, unincentivized citizen patrols that suffer from free riding and inhibit timely community detection of and responses to deforestation. Should our findings be replicated elsewhere, they imply that externally facilitated community-based monitoring protocols that combine remote-sensed early deforestation alerts with training and incentives for monitors could contribute to sustainable forest management.

The auditory organs of these animals are extremely diverse in anatomy after hundreds of millions of years of evolution, yet all are made up of cellular tissue and are morphologically part of the body of the animal. Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. We find that the wispy, wheel-shaped orb web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to capture the sound-induced air particle movements that approach the maximum physical efficiency better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By sensing the motion of web threads, the spider remotely detects and localizes the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave, such as those emitted by approaching prey or predators. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,00"

We find that a phaseout of fossil fuels can avoid an excess mortality rate of 3.61 (2.96–4.21) million per year from outdoor air pollution worldwide. This could be up to 5.55 (4.52–6.52) million per year by additionally controlling nonfossil anthropogenic sources. Globally, fossil-fuel-related emissions account for about 65% of the excess mortality, and 70% of the climate cooling by anthropogenic aerosols. The chemical influence of air pollution on aeolian dust contributes to the aerosol cooling. Since aerosols mask the anthropogenic rise in global temperature, removing fossil-fuel-generated particles liberates 0.51(±0.03) °C and all pollution particles 0.73(±0.03) °C warming, reaching around 2 °C over North America and Northeast Asia.

Particularly striking are women with artificial skull deformations; the analysis of their collective genetic ancestry suggests an origin in southeastern Europe. In addition, functional variants revealed that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago. Our results indicate that complex demographic processes during the Early Medieval period may have contributed in an unexpected way to shape the modern European genetic landscape. This study also demonstrates the utility of high-coverage genome sequencing for the study of ancient human populations. The data presented here will be useful for future studies of the genetic history of Europe during the Early Medieval period. The panel of functional loci will also be useful for future studies of the genetic effects of"

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how HKU4 and HKU5 transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. First, whereas MERS-CoV prefers human DPP4 over bat DPP4 as its receptor, HKU4 shows the opposite trend. Second, in the absence of exogenous proteases, both MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes mediate pseudovirus entry into bat cells, whereas only MERS-CoV spike, but not HKU4 spike, mediates pseudovirus entry into human cells. Thus, MERS-CoV, but not HKU4,"

Pathogen-agnostic mNGS investigation of febrile persons in resource-scarce Southeast Asia is feasible and revealing of a diverse pathogen landscape. Coordinated and ongoing mNGS pathogen surveillance can better identify the breadth of endemic, zoonotic, or emerging pathogens and deployment of rapid public health response. This study highlights the importance of mNGS in resource-scarce settings where outbreaks are likely to emerge but where laboratory diagnostics and bioinformatics capacity are limited. This study also demonstrates the potential of mNGS to detect pathogens that are difficult to culture, such as Plasmodium knowlesi, leptospirosis, and HIV.

The stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. In S. cerevisiae, the extreme stability of the pol δ holoenzyme ensures that every nucleobase within an Okazaki fragment is faithfully duplicated before dissociation but also necessitates an active displacement mechanism for polymerase recycling and exchange. In humans, the pol δ holoenzyme is more stable than in S. cerevisiae, but the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme in humans is unknown. We designed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. Surprisingly, the results indicate that human pol δ maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This study provides a unique insight into the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme in humans. It also provides a unique insight into the mechanism of DNA replication in humans. This study"

In the hypothesized RNA world, before the evolution of proteins, genetic information was stored in RNA molecules that were replicated by ribozymes. In an effort toward reconstructing RNA-based life in the laboratory, we used in vitro evolution to improve the activity of an RNA polymerase ribozyme. The improved polymerase ribozyme can synthesize a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and, in low yield, even tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins. This work provides a proof of principle for the reconstruction of RNA-based life. It also provides a platform for the study of the origin of life, including the search for the RNA-based replicator and the RNA world.

We connect changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities. Our results also suggest that the physical appearance of neighborhoods may be a key factor in understanding the spatial distribution of economic and social outcomes.

Xanthocillin-derived copper-binding metabolites are secreted and inhibit the activity of fungal and bacterial laccases, and inhibit the growth of pathogenic fungi in coculture with human pathogens. The existence of the xan BGC in several filamentous fungi suggests a heretofore unknown role of eukaryotic natural products in copper homeostasis and mediation of interactions with competing microbes.

Despite its economic and ecological importance, the geographic distribution and evolutionary impact of late-spring frosts are poorly understood. We analyze the geographic distribution of late-spring frosts and the resistance strategies of woody species to infer trees’ adaptations for minimizing frost damage to their leaves. We find that areas in which late-spring frosts are common, such as eastern North America, harbor tree species with cautious (late-leafing) leaf-out strategies. Areas in which late-spring frosts used to be unlikely, such as broad-leaved forests and shrublands in Europe and Asia, instead harbor opportunistic tree species (quickly reacting to warming air temperatures). Given species’ innate resistance strategies, we estimate that ∼35% of the European and ∼26% of the Asian temperate forest area, but only ∼10% of the North American, will experience increasing late-frost damage in the future.

Anaplasma induces ticks to express antifreeze glycoprotein (iafgp), which encodes a protein with several properties, including the ability to alter bacterial biofilm formation. IAFGP binds the terminal d-alanine residue of the pentapeptide chain of bacterial peptidoglycan, resulting in altered permeability and the capacity of bacteria to form biofilms.

Here, we describe a basal pygostylian, Jinguofortis perplexus, from the Early Cretaceous of China that adds important information about early members of the short-tailed bird group. The presence of a fused scapulocoracoid in adult individuals independently evolved in Jinguofortisidae and Confuciusornithiformes may relate to an accelerated osteogenesis during chondrogenesis and likely formed through the heterochronic process of peramorphosis by which these basal taxa retain the scapulocoracoid of the nonavian theropod ancestors with the addition of flight-related modifications. With wings having a low aspect ratio and wing loading, Jinguofortis may have been adapted particularly to dense forest environments.

This comes from analysis of observations showing that stratospheric water vapor increases with tropospheric temperature, implying the existence of a stratospheric water vapor feedback. We estimate the strength of this feedback in a chemistry–climate model to be +0.3 W/(m2⋅K), which would be a significant contributor to the overall climate sensitivity. One-third of this feedback comes from increases in water vapor entering the stratosphere through the tropical tropopause layer, with the rest coming from increases in water vapor entering through the extratropical tropopause. This finding is important because it shows that the stratosphere is a key player in the climate system. It also shows that the climate system is more sensitive to changes in stratospheric water vapor than previously thought. This finding has implications for climate models, which have not included the stratospheric water vapor feedback. It also has implications for climate policy, as it shows that reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the stratosphere could have a greater impact on climate change than reducing emissions in the troposphere.

The source of the parchment, often called “uterine vellum,” has been a long-standing controversy in codicology. Use of the Latin term abortivum in many sources has led some scholars to suggest that fetal calves or sheep skins were used. Others have argued that it would not be possible to sustain herds if so many pocket Bibles were produced from fetal skins, arguing instead for unexpected alternatives, such as rabbit. Here, we report a simple and objective method using standard conservation treatments to identify the animal origin of parchment. The noninvasive method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals; however, we did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides.

The extinction occurred between 251.941 ± 0.037 and 251.880 ± 0.031 Mya, an interval of 60 ± 48 ka. Onset of a major reorganization of the carbon cycle immediately precedes the initiation of extinction and is punctuated by a sharp (3‰), short-lived negative spike in the isotopic composition of carbonate carbon. Carbon cycle volatility persists for ∼500 ka before a return to near preextinction values. Decamillenial to millennial level resolution of the mass extinction and its aftermath will permit a refined evaluation of the relative roles of rate-dependent processes contributing to the extinction, allowing insight into postextinction ecosystem expansion. The Meishan section provides a unique opportunity to test the plausibility of trigger and kill"

However, the intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific function of RORα is still unclear. Here, we generate intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific RORα-deficient (RORαΔIEC) mice and find that RORα is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis by attenuating nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcriptional activity. RORαΔIEC mice exhibit excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis reveals corecruitment of RORα and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) on NF-κB target promoters and subsequent dismissal of CREB binding protein (CBP) and bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) for transcriptional repression.

The D614G mutation in the spike protein is the most prevalent mutation in the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses. We use cryo-electron microscopy to compare the structure of the spike protein with and without this mutation and show that the D614G mutation leads to a more open conformation of the spike protein. This may facilitate binding to the receptor and subsequent viral membrane fusion. Our results suggest that the D614G mutation may increase the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. This may explain why the D614G mutation is the most prevalent mutation in the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Our results also suggest that the D614G mutation may be less pathogenic.

We quantify the effects of climate change and human demography on fire activity and carbon emissions using a coupled climate–fire–carbon cycle model. We find that changes in human demography tend to suppress global fire activity, keeping more carbon within terrestrial ecosystems and attenuating warming. However, recent and predicted future reductions in fire activity may enhance land carbon uptake and corresponding to offsetting ∼5 to 10 y of global CO2 emissions at today’s levels. This potentially reduces warming by up to 0.11 °C by 2100. We show that ignitions and active and passive fire suppression can be as important in driving future fire regimes as changes in climate.

This pandemic is generally understood as the consequence of a singular introduction of Yersinia pestis, after which the disease established itself in European rodents over four centuries. To locate these putative plague reservoirs, we studied the climate fluctuations that preceded regional plague epidemics, based on a dataset of 7,711 georeferenced historical plague outbreaks and 15 annually resolved tree-ring records from Europe and Asia. We provide evidence for repeated climate-driven reintroductions of the bacterium into European harbors from reservoirs in Asia, with a delay of 15 ± 1 y.

Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML.

We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA. Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% by the year 2100 under an intermediate-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5 [SSP2-4.5]) and to 80% under a high-emission scenario (SSP5-8.5).

In this study, we generated conditional knockout (CKO) mice that lack ASK1 in microglia/macrophages, astrocytes, microglia, or astrocytes in T cells and dendritic cells. We found that ASK1 deficiency in microglia/macrophages and astrocytes ameliorated EAE severity in the later stage, whereas ASK1 deficiency in T cells and dendritic cells had no significant effects on EAE. We also found that ASK1 in microglia/macrophages induces a proinflammatory environment, which subsequently activates astrocytes to exacerbate neuroinflammation.

We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

We call for a renewed focus on the social determinants of health, including the working conditions of the middle class. We also call for a renewed focus on the importance of education, including the need to ensure that all adults have the skills to find and keep good jobs. Finally, we call for a renewed focus on the importance of social support, including the need to ensure that all adults have access to the social safety net. If we fail to do so, tomorrow’s elderly will be sicker than today’s elderly, with potentially serious implications for healthcare."

Here, we show that the squid Euprymna scolopes regulates the provision of a single glycan to its symbiotic luminescent bacteria, Vibrio fischeri, in a diel rhythm. We also show that the glycan is required for the persistence of the symbionts in the host organ. Finally, we show that the glycan is catabolized by the symbionts, which is required for a periodic acidification of the host organ that enhances the luminescence of the symbionts. We propose that this glycan-catabolizing symbiosis may be a common mechanism used by animals to regulate the activities of their associated microbes.

In two experiments, teachers who were trained to adopt an empathic mindset about discipline reduced their use of suspension. In a randomized field experiment, this intervention halved suspension rates from 9.6% to 4.8%. This study has implications for the future of school discipline and the future of US education.

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis remain unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We found that pol II stalling at O2-EtdT and N3-EtdT sites is exacerbated by TFIIS-stimulated proofreading activity. Assessment for the impact of the EtdT lesions on individual fidelity checkpoints provided further mechanistic insights, where the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas the more rigid uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into"

We find that each oncogene has somewhat different surfaceomes, but the functions of these proteins are harmonized by common biological themes including up-regulation of nutrient transporters, down-regulation of adhesion molecules and tumor suppressing phosphatases, and alteration in immune modulators. Addition of a potent MEK inhibitor that blocks MAPK signaling brings each oncogene-induced surfaceome back to a common state reflecting the strong dependence of the oncogene on the MAPK pathway to propagate signaling.

Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus. Using silent trans-complementary mutants, we demonstrated that this interaction takes place in infected cells and is required for optimal viral replication. Disruption of this interaction decreased the amount of viral RNA in the viral particles, resulting in an eightfold increase in empty viral particles.

Actions to raise awareness and increase management in regions prone to human-started wildfires should be a focus of United States policy to reduce fire risk and associated hazards. Our findings highlight the need to consider human-caused wildfires as a major driver of overall fire risk in the United States. This is especially important in the context of climate change, which has likely enabled a portion of the increase in wildfire activity. Our findings also highlight the need to consider the role of human activities in shaping the fire regime of the United States. Our findings are relevant to policy makers, land managers, and the general public. Our findings have implications for fire management, climate change adaptation, and ecosystem management. Our"

We connect changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities. Our results also suggest that the physical appearance of neighborhoods may be a useful indicator of the economic and demographic characteristics of the residents who live there. This may have important implications for urban planning and policy. Our results also suggest that the physical appearance of neighborhoods may be a useful indicator of the"

While the symptoms and consequences of this breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis have been extensively characterized, the underlying causes remain poorly understood. Here, we show that altered nutrient cycling during heat stress is a primary driver of the functional breakdown of the symbiosis. Heat stress increased the metabolic energy demand of the coral host, which was compensated by the catabolic degradation of amino acids. The resulting shift from net uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont subsequently promoted the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host. Energy limitation and altered symbiotic nutrient cycling are thus key factors in the early heat stress response, directly contributing to the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis. Interpreting the stability of the coral holobiont in light of its metabolic interactions provides a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

In all animals, the epithelium is maintained by a dynamic interaction with the microbiome. Here, we investigate the consequences of tumorigenesis on the microbiome using a Drosophila intestinal tumor model. We show that upon loss of BMP signaling, tumors lead to aberrant activation of JNK/Mmp2 signaling, followed by intestinal barrier dysfunction and commensal imbalance. In turn, the dysbiotic microbiome triggers a regenerative response and stimulates tumor growth. We find that inhibiting JNK signaling or depletion of the microbiome restores barrier function of the intestinal epithelium, leading to a reestablishment of host–microbe homeostasis, and organismic lifespan extension. Our experiments identify a JNK-dependent feedback amplification loop between intestinal tumors and the microbiome. They also highlight the importance of controlling the activity level of JNK signaling to maintain epithelial barrier function and host–microbe homeostasis. Our study identifies a mechanism that can be exploited to control tumorigenesis and host–microbiome interactions. This work also provides a framework for understanding the role of the microbiome in cancer progression and treatment. It also provides a model for studying the"

We derive a gridded global map of riverine fisheries and assess its implications for biodiversity conservation, fishery sustainability, and food security. We find that 90% of global catch comes from river basins with above-average stress levels. Fish richness and catches are positively but not causally correlated, revealing that fishing pressure is most intense in rivers where potential impacts on biodiversity are highest. Merging our catch analysis with nutritional and socioeconomic data, we find that freshwater fisheries provide the equivalent of all dietary animal protein for 158 million people. Poor and undernourished populations are particularly reliant on inland fisheries compared with marine or aquaculture sources. The spatial coincidence of productive freshwater fisheries and low food security highlights the critical role of rivers and lakes in providing locally sourced, low-cost protein. At the same time, intensive fishing in regions where rivers are already degraded by other stressors may undermine efforts to conserve biodiversity. This syndrome of poverty, nutritional deficiency, fishery dependence, and extrinsic threats to biodiverse river ecosystems underscores the high stakes for improving fishery management. Our enhanced spatial data on estimated catches can facilitate the inclusion of inland fisheries in environmental planning to protect"

In mammals, however, the CNS is incapable of regenerating after injury, and the only known regenerative capacity is in the peripheral nervous system. Here, we identify a form of regeneration in the adult nervous system that is independent of the canonical MAPK signaling pathway. This DLK-independent regeneration is triggered by physical lesion of the neuron’s sensory dendrite and is enhanced by reducing neuronal activity and elevating cAMP. We also identify a form of endogenous activity-dependent ectopic axon growth in the same neuron type that is triggered by sensory lesion and is enhanced by reducing neuronal activity and elevating cAMP.

In contrast, in Parkinson’s disease (PD), this RSN was subordinated to an independent disease-related pattern. Network functionality was assessed by quantifying metabolic RSN expression in cerebral blood flow PET scans acquired at rest and during task performance. We found that the dominant RSN was deactivated during rest in healthy subjects and early PD patients, whereas the subordinate RSNs were activated during task performance.

Fibrous sheath interacting protein 1 (FSIP1) is a cancer antigen expressed in the majority of TNBCs and is associated with poor prognosis. However, the role of FSIP1 in TNBC progression and drug sensitivity has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies.

Silencing of the underlying gene in transgenic plants abolished production of aliphatic and aromatic nitrogenous volatiles in ripe fruit, and metabolomic analysis of these fruit revealed the accumulation of 2-isobutyl-tetrahydrothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid, a known conjugate of cysteine and 3-methylbutanal. Biosynthetic incorporation of stable isotope-labeled precursors into 2-isobutylthiazole and 2-phenylacetonitrile confirmed that cysteine provides the nitrogen atom for all nitrogenous volatiles in tomato fruit.

However, these threats are frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we use high-throughput experiments to investigate how changes in temperature affect the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We found that changes in temperature systematically altered the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures departed from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increased, meaning that more species were required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. Our findings have important implications for our ability to predict the impacts of climate change on ecosystem functioning. They also highlight the need to consider the potential for synergistic effects between biodiversity loss and environmental warming. This is particularly important in the context of land-use change, where biodiversity loss and environmental warming are often considered separately. Our results suggest that the impacts of land-use change on ecosystem functioning may be more severe than previously thought."

It creates a map of local space, based on the firing patterns of grid, head-direction (HD), border, and object-vector (OV) cells. How these cell types are organized anatomically is debated. Here, we used portable two-photon microscopes to examine the topographic arrangement of spatially modulated neurons in the superficial layers of MEC and adjacent parasubiculum during unrestrained behavior. Our data suggest that grid cells exhibit strong coupling among themselves but weaker links to other cell types. This suggests that grid cells might be largely distinct from those of border, HD, and OV cells. Our findings have implications for understanding the neural basis of navigation.

We demonstrate that striatonigral fibers originating in striosomes form highly unusual bouquet-like arborizations that target bundles of ventrally extending dopamine-containing dendrites and clusters of their parent nigral cell bodies. These clustered cell bodies in turn project to the striatum as part of the classic nigrostriatal pathway. Thus, these striosome–dendron bouquets likely represent subsystems with the nigro–striato–nigral loop that are affected in human disorders including Parkinson’s disease. Given evidence that striosomes receive input from cortical regions related to the control of mood and motivation and that they link functionally to reinforcement and decision-making, the striosome–dendron bouquets could be critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease. This study provides a unique view of the dopamine-containing nigral system. It also suggests that striosomes may be important in the control of movement and motivation.

For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Finally, we demonstrate that this signal is used by third-party listeners as a heuristic of how well people are connected: Conversations with faster response times were perceived as more connected than the same conversations with slower response times. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.” This work provides a new way to measure and understand social connection.

SAN cells (SANCs) are responsible for generating the heart rate and are characterized by unique electrophysiological properties. SAN automaticity is regulated by a Ca2+ clock and a membrane clock. Here, we report that stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and Orai1 channels, key components of store-operated Ca2+ entry, are selectively expressed in SANCs. Cardiac-specific deletion of STIM1 in mice resulted in depletion of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ stores of SANCs and led to SAN dysfunction, as was evident by a reduction in heart rate, sinus arrest, and an exaggerated autonomic response to cholinergic signaling. Moreover, STIM1 influenced SAN function by regulating ionic fluxes in SANCs, including activation of a store-operated Ca2+ current, a reduction in L-type Ca2+ current, and enhancing the activities of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. These studies reveal that STIM1 is a multifunctional regulator of Ca2+ dynamics in SANCs that links SR Ca2+ store content with electrical events occurring in the"

NMDAR-Abs are believed to disrupt receptor function, but how blocking this excitatory synaptic receptor can lead to paroxysmal EEG abnormalities—or even seizures—is poorly understood. Here we show that NMDAR-Abs change intrinsic cortical connections and neuronal population dynamics to alter the spectral composition of spontaneous EEG activity and predispose brain dynamics to paroxysmal abnormalities. Based on local field potential recordings in a mouse model, we first validate a dynamic causal model of NMDAR-Ab effects on cortical microcircuitry. Using this model, we then identify the key synaptic parameters that best explain EEG paroxysms in pediatric patients with NMDAR-Ab encephalitis. Finally, we use the mouse model to show that NMDAR-Ab–related changes render microcircuitry critically susceptible to overt EEG paroxysms when these key parameters are changed, even though the same parameter fluctuations are tolerated in the in silico model of the control condition.

Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation.

Here we investigate the effects of multiple alleles on secondary sexual characteristics in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii, where two alleles interact to produce siblings with four possible sex classes. We find that multiple alleles can produce modular variation in morphological and behavioral traits, including genital morphology, craniofacial morphology, gastrointestinal morphology, and home tank behaviors. The modularity of secondary sexual characteristics produced by multiple alleles provides context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations. Our results suggest that the maintenance of multiple alleles in a species can produce a diversity of phenotypes that can be used to track the history of the species.

We found that intracellular Fe promotes bisretinoid oxidation and degradation. This interpretation was supported by experiments showing that Fe chelation decreased the oxidative/degradation of the bisretinoid A2E in the presence of light and reduced cell death in cell-based experiments. Moreover, light-independent oxidation and degradation of A2E by Fenton chemistry products were evidenced by the consumption of A2E, release of dicarbonyls, and generation of oxidized A2E species in cell-free assays. These findings indicate that Fe is a key regulator of bisretinoid metabolism. Our results suggest that Fe chelation may be a useful strategy to reduce the oxidative burden of the retina. This interpretation is supported by the observation that Fe chelation decreased the oxidative burden of the retina in a mouse model of age-related macular degeneration. Our findings also suggest that Fe"

They are a unique group of predators because their tentacles are specialized for prey capture, and because they can be either generalist or specialist predators. We studied the evolution of siphonophore tentacles, and found that they are highly specialized for prey capture. We also found that siphonophore specialists can evolve into generalists, and that specialists on one prey type have evolved into specialists on other prey types. Our findings suggest that shifts between prey types are linked to shifts in the morphology, mode of evolution, and evolutionary correlations of tentilla and their nematocysts. These findings contribute to understanding how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs. They also help build a broader perspective on predatory niche diversification via morphological innovation and evolution. This work contributes to the broader goal of understanding how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs.

The fossil record for the evolution of the human hand is incomplete between 800,000 and 1.8 My old, a time interval well documented for the emergence and subsequent proliferation of Acheulian technology (shaped bifacial stone tools). Modern and Middle to Late Pleistocene humans share a suite of derived features in the thumb, wrist, and radial carpometacarpal joints that is noticeably absent in early hominins. We show that this suite was present ∼1.42 Mya in an East African hominin from Kaitio, West Turkana, Kenya. This fossil thus provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key shared derived characteristic of modern human and Neandertal hand morphology and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato. This study also provides the earliest evidence for the evolution of the third metacarpal styloid process, a key derived characteristic of the modern human hand. This study also provides the earliest evidence for the evolution of the third metacar"

Cancer cells have increased demand for the one-carbon unit, and thus have up-regulated the folate cycle enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). Here we show that dual knockout of SHMT1 and SHMT2 in cancer cells blocks tumor growth. We also identify small-molecule dual inhibitors of SHMT1 and SHMT2. These inhibitors are effective in cancer cell-lines, but are toxic in normal cells. Thus, the folate cycle enzyme SHMT is a promising therapeutic target for cancer. Finally, we show that cancer cells have defective glycine import, and thus are uniquely dependent upon SHMT enzymatic activity to meet glycine demand. This is a targetable metabolic deficiency of cancer. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of cancer. This is a promising therapeutic target for cancer. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of cancer. This is a promising therapeutic target. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of cancer.

However, little is known about the role of natural landscapes such as forests in improving people’s diets. In this study, we used a unique dataset to show that deforestation can reduce people’s fruit and vegetable consumption and thus their vitamin A intake. Conversely, we found that forest fragmentation can increase fruit and vegetable consumption and dietary vitamin A adequacy. These findings have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. Our findings also highlight the need to consider the role of natural landscapes in improving people’s diets.

We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the recent discovery of a 100-m-long, 10-m-wide, and 3-m-deep, 1"
