The most promising approach is to reconstruct quantum theory from a set of axioms. The most ambitious reconstruction programs have been based on the assumption that the category of Hilbert spaces and bounded operators is equivalent to the category of continuous linear functions between them. We provide a set of purely categorical axioms that guarantee this equivalence.

Although the evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we compare the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results show that the myxozoan body plan was reduced to a minimal structure, and that the genome was reduced in size and gene content. These results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides a unique resource for understanding the evolution of the Myxozoa. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to block nuclear import of IFN-stimulated factors (ISFs) in order to impair transcriptional induction of ISGs. We found that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 evades the host immune response and may help in the development of new antiviral strategies. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of the Hv1 channel. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels"

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa from DNA sequences. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species (six wild, one domestic) in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This study highlights the importance of diet composition in understanding the role of LMH in African savanna biodiversity. (Read more)"

We show that the global load of floating plastic debris is far less than expected, mostly accumulating in the convergence zones of the five subtropical gyres. However, the fate of this missing plastic is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean. Our results suggest that the missing plastic debris is mostly removed from the surface of the open ocean by a size-selective sink. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. This sink may be of importance to understand the global load of floating plastic debris. (Less)"

The treatment of hypertension is the cornerstone of cardiovascular disease prevention. The most widely used drugs for treating hypertension are the voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs). However, the long-term use of LCCBs is associated with the development of heart failure. Here, we show that LCCBs activate the STIM/ORAI Ca2+ signaling pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells, which is a key regulator of vascular remodeling. Our findings may help to explain the adverse effects of LCCBs and may lead to the development of new strategies for the treatment of hypertension."

The NWFP has been successful in halting the decline of early-seral ecosystems, but the policy has not yet been effective in reversing the decline of older-forest–associated bird populations. This underscores the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure.

We show that the approach is successful in identifying a compound that is 56 times more active than telithromycin, a clinically used antibiotic, against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. The approach is also successful in identifying a compound that is synergistic with colistin, a membrane-weakening drug, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

We used a comprehensive dataset of 89 genes to estimate the timing and rates of beetle diversification, and a dataset of 154 genomes or transcriptomes to trace the evolution of genes enabling specialized plant feeding. Our analyses resolved controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, corresponding diversification rate increases suggest that these novel genes triggered adaptive radiations that resulted in nearly half of all living beetle species. We propose that these novel genes enabled efficient digestion of plant tissues, including lignocellulose in cell walls, facilitating the evolution of uniquely specialized plant-feeding habits, such as leaf mining and stem and wood boring. Beetle diversity thus appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding plant-digesting enzymes. This work provides a framework for understanding the evolution of beetles and their role in the global carbon cycle. (Show"

However, the evolution of brain neuronal density is rarely studied. We show that reptiles have not only small brains relative to body size but also low neuronal densities, resulting in average neuron numbers over 20 times lower than those in birds and mammals of similar body size. This has important implications for studies using relative brain size as a proxy when looking for evolutionary drivers of animal cognition. We also show that relative brain size is associated with relative neuronal cell density in reptiles, birds, and primates but not in other mammals. This suggests that the evolution of neuronal density may be a more reliable indicator of brain power than brain size."

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal and transformed cells is more complex than previously appreciated. We have shown that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1 may act as a tumor suppressor in some settings. These data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This is the first study to show that TRAP1 can regulate the metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in mammalian cells. Our findings also suggest that TRAP1 may be a potential target for cancer therapy. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)."

However, how it does so is not well understood. Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques, coupled to microfluidics, to study the action of ADF in different mechanical situations. We find that ADF binds to filaments and induces their severing in a mechanical-torque-dependent manner. This mechanism is critical to boost ADF’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for how ADF/cofilin, a protein that is involved in severing actin filaments, is able to do so in a physiological context, where filaments are interconnected and under mechanical stress. Our findings also provide a general mechanism for understanding the action of proteins that are involved in severing filaments. This mechanism may be relevant to other severing proteins, such as the F-actin depolymerizing activity of the Arp2/3 complex. Finally, our study provides a proof of principle for the use of microfluidics to study the action of proteins in a physiological context. This approach may be useful for studying other proteins and complexes in cells."

The island is located ∼400 km from the east coast of Africa, but its genetic and linguistic traits are from both Southeast Asia and Eastern Africa. We used a grid-based approach to sample at high resolution the genomic diversity (including maternal lineages, paternal lineages, and genome-wide data) across 257 villages and 2,704 Malagasy individuals. We find a common Bantu and Austronesian descent for all Malagasy individuals with a limited paternal contribution from Europe and the Middle East. The admixture and demographic growth happened recently, suggesting a rapid settlement of Madagascar during the last millennium. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, there are geographic influences on the present genomic diversity, independent of the admixture, showing that a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations.

We use a quantitative approach to test hypotheses for the drivers of body size evolution in aquatic mammals. We find that the evolution of an aquatic lifestyle is driving three of the four extant aquatic mammal clades toward a size attractor at ∼500 kg. The existence of this body size attractor and the relatively rapid selection toward, and limited deviation from, this attractor rule out most hypothesized drivers of size increase. These results are consistent with control by differences in the scaling of energetic intake and cost functions with body size between the terrestrial and aquatic realms. The optimum size occurs at an intermediate value where thermoregulatory costs are low but feeding efficiency remains high. Rather than being released from size pressures, water-dwelling mammals are driven and confined to larger body sizes by the strict energetic demands of the aquatic medium. This work provides a quantitative framework for understanding the evolution of body size in aquatic mammals. (Show more)"

To understand the mechanism of temperature-dependent growth, we compared the transcriptional response of primary mouse airway epithelial cells infected with rhinovirus at 33 °C vs. 37 °C. We found that mouse airway cells infected with mouse-adapted rhinovirus exhibit a striking enrichment in expression of antiviral defense response genes at 37 °C relative to 33 °C. This correlates with significantly higher expression levels of type I and type III IFN genes and ISGs at 37 °C. Temperature-dependent IFN induction in response to rhinovirus is dependent on the MAVS protein, a key signaling adaptor of the RIG-I–like receptors. Stimulation of primary airway cells with the synthetic RLR ligand poly I:C leads to greater IFN induction at 37 °C relative to 33 °C at early time points poststimulation and to a sustained increase in the induction of ISGs at 37 °C relative to 33 °C.

These results are supported further by an extensive survey of faunal remains from 234 sites in the Southern Levant, spanning more than three millennia, which shows a sharp increase in the frequency of chicken during the Hellenistic period. We further argue that the earliest secure evidence for economic exploitation of chickens in Europe dates to the first century B.C.E. and therefore is predated by the finds in the Southern Levant by at least a century. We suggest that the gradual acclimatization of chickens in the Southern Levant and its gradual integration into the local economy, the latter fully accomplished in the Hellenistic period, was a crucial step in the adoption of this species in European husbandry some 100 y later."

However, the mechanisms of action of many plant defense components remain unknown. Here, we show that a plant antifungal peptide, NCR044, has a unique structural architecture and exhibits potent fungicidal activity against multiple plant fungal pathogens. It binds to bioactive phosphoinositides and induces reactive oxygen species, which leads to the death of fungal cells. This work provides a foundation for the development of this class of peptides as a spray-on fungistat/fungicide.

The K+ channel BK channel is a unique channel in that it does not possess an intracellular activation gate and normally shows no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also found that C-type inactivation in BK channels is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. Our findings provide a new perspective on the regulation of ion channels. (Show more)"

In temperate regions, seasonal outbreaks are associated with decreases in ambient humidity. However, the impact of humidity on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear.

We find that low humidity impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the impact of ambient humidity on influenza virus infection and disease outcome.

This pattern of activity is consistent with a merge operation that applies equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity.

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, in the days (Studies 1 and 2) and months (Studies 3 through 6) following the 2016 American presidential election, women’s and men’s endorsement of HM predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. In addition, as conceptualized, HM was associated with less trust in the government (Study 3), more sexism (Study 4), more racism (Study 5), and more xenophobia (Study 6) but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors. Whereas HM predicted evaluations of Trump, across studies, social and prejudiced attitudes predicted evaluations of his democratic challengers: Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2"

Practices that increase the amount of carbon in the particulate organic matter fraction also increase the amount of carbon in the mineral-associated fraction, which is more resistant to decomposition. These results highlight the importance of the distribution of C in the soil and the need to consider this when evaluating the effectiveness of soil health management practices.

We demonstrate that nesocodin is attractive to the vertebrate pollinator, Phelsuma geckos, and provide evidence for convergent evolution of this trait in two other hummingbird-visited species. Our findings suggest that the color of nectar is a trait that is selectively favored and that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. First, whereas MERS-CoV prefers human DPP4 over bat DPP4 as its receptor, HKU4 shows the opposite trend. Second, in the absence of exogenous proteases, both MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes mediate pseudovirus entry into bat cells, whereas only MERS-CoV spike, but not HKU4 spike, mediates pseudovirus entry into human cells.

First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology.

The source of the parchment, often called “uterine vellum,” has been a long-standing controversy in codicology. Here, we report a simple and objective method to identify the animal origin of parchment. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals, but did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides. These results suggest that ultrafine vellum does not necessarily derive from the use of abortive or newborn animals with ultrathin hides, but could equally well reflect a production process that allowed the skins of maturing animals of several species to be rendered into vellum of equal quality and fineness. This method could be used to identify the source of parchment from the earliest pocket Bibles. (Less)"

RORαΔIEC mice exhibit excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs.

Photosynthesis relies on these modified tetrapyrroles for the capture of solar radiation and its conversion to chemical energy. The formation of the isocyclic fifth ring, the key reaction in the biosynthesis of chlorophyll, has remained enigmatic for more than 60 y. This reaction is catalyzed by two unrelated cyclase enzymes using different chemistries. The majority of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria use BchE, an O2-sensitive [4Fe-4S] cluster protein, whereas plants, cyanobacteria, and some phototrophic bacteria possess an O2-dependent enzyme, the major catalytic component of which is a diiron protein, AcsF. Plant and cyanobacterial mutants in ycf54 display impaired function of the O2-dependent enzyme, accumulating the reaction substrate. Swapping cyclases between cyanobacteria and purple phototrophic bacteria reveals three classes of the O2-dependent enzyme. AcsF is the cyclase in Rubrivivax gelatinosus, whereas alphaproteobacterial cyclases require a newly discovered protein, BciE, encoded by a gene conserved"

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the converging functions of autism-risk genes and may facilitate the identification of causal paths. This study also provides a model system for studying the role of behavioral flexibility in autism. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)."

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Virions must first be secreted from virus-producing cells, and then bind to target-cell receptors, before sequential proteolysis occurs. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages.

The food choices people make are a key driver of these trends. This study demonstrates that increasing the proportion of vegetarian meals available in a large catering operation can have a significant impact on meal selection. This is a simple and low-cost intervention that could be implemented in a wide range of settings. The results suggest that increasing the proportion of vegetarian meals available could lead to proportional reductions in meat consumption of 60% or more. This is a significant contribution to the global effort to reduce the environmental and health impacts of the food system. The results also suggest that the impact of this intervention is concentrated among the people who are least likely to select vegetarian meals today. This suggests that the intervention could be used to target the people who are most in need of dietary change. The results also suggest that the intervention may be effective in other settings, such as hospitals. This study provides a model for how interventions can be used to promote sustainable diets at the population level."

Here we apply quantitative proteomics to reveal how a collection of some 700 surface proteins is dramatically remodeled in a collection of isogenic breast epithelial cell lines stably expressing six of the most prominent oncogenes, including the receptor tyrosine kinases, EGFR and HER2, and downstream signaling partners such as KRAS, BRAF, MEK, and AKT. We find that each oncogene has somewhat different surfaceomes, but the functions of these proteins are harmonized by common biological themes including up-regulation of nutrient transporters, down-regulation of adhesion molecules and tumor suppressing phosphatases, and alteration in immune modulators. These studies provide a broad systems-level view of how specific driver oncogenes remodel the surfaceome and the glycoproteome in a cell autologous fashion, and suggest possible surface targets, and combinations thereof, for drug and biomarker discovery.

Here we show that hypobaric hypoxia induces cerebral edema and neuronal apoptosis in rats and that this effect is mediated by the corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF)/CRF receptor type 1 (CRFR1) pathway. We also show that the up-regulated cAMP/PKA signaling contributes to the phosphorylation and expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) to enhance water influx into astrocytes and produces an up-regulation of endothelin-1 (ET-1) expression. Finally, using transfected cells, we show that transfected CRFR1 contributes to edema via transfected AQP4. In conclusion, hypobaric hypoxia triggers cortical release of CRF, which acts on CRFR1 to trigger signaling of cAMP/PKA in cortical astrocytes, leading to activation of AQP4 and edema. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the pathophysiology of cerebral edema and may lead to the development of new therapies.

Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology.

However, the role of FSIP1 in the progression and drug sensitivity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies.

For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection.

Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results highlight the importance of certification in the context of a broader set of policies and actions. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

It is conserved from bacteria to humans. The exocyst complex is involved in several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. The exocyst complex is involved in several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. However, the molecular mechanism of the exocyst complex is not fully understood. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 (exocyst component of 70 kDa) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

In vertebrates, sex is determined by a single locus, which can be male- or female-determining. In species with a single locus, sex is determined by a single genotype, and the sex of an individual is determined by the genotype of the gonads. In species with multiple alleles at a sex locus, sex is determined by the genotype of the gonads and sex can be male, female, or intersex. Here we show that the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii has a sex determination locus with multiple alleles, and that the alleles interact to produce four possible genotypes, which can be male or female. We discuss the evolutionary consequences of this modular sex determination system. (Show more)"

These compounds are photooxidized and degraded into reactive intermediates that can cause damage to the retina. We show that the accumulation of the most abundant of these compounds, A2E, is reduced in mice treated with a chelator of iron, a metal that is known to be elevated in the retina. These findings suggest that the accumulation of lipofuscin is influenced by the levels of iron in the retina. This work also demonstrates that the degradation of A2E is light-dependent and that the presence of iron can accelerate this process. These findings have implications for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in the elderly. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)."

Predator specialization is often considered an evolutionary dead end, but in some predators, morphological and functional optimizations are localized in separate structures dedicated to prey capture. We show that siphonophores, a group of pelagic colonial cnidarians, have evolved modular prey capture systems that are linked to the diversification of their diets. These findings help us understand how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs. They also provide a case study for understanding the evolution of morphological innovations and the role of modularity in the diversification of predator diets."

Despite the discovery of relatively complete hands from two early hominin species, the evolution of the hand is poorly understood during the time interval between these discoveries and the emergence of modern human-like hand morphology and function. Here we report the discovery of a hand fossil from a Middle Pleistocene hominin that provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key derived feature of the human hand, the third metacarpal styloid process. This fossil suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato. This study also highlights the importance of the fossil record for understanding the evolution of the human hand. (Show more)"

One-carbon units are critical for cell growth, and SHMT is strongly up-regulated in cancer. Here we show that dual knockout of SHMT1 and SHMT2 in mice blocks tumor growth. We also identify small-molecule dual inhibitors of SHMT1 and SHMT2, and show that they block cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we show that formate, the one-carbon donor, rescues cells from SHMT inhibition, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of DLBCL. These results have implications for cancer therapy and for the design of small-molecule inhibitors of SHMT.

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We hypothesize that the paradox of prehistoric subsoil compaction, with potential loss of productivity, is a result of the roaming of sauropods, which may have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles. This hypothesis suggests that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This study highlights the importance of considering the mechanical properties of the soil when designing farm machinery. (Show more)"
