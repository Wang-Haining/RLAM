However, the structure of hydrate with guest molecules is still not well understood. In this work, we report the structure of hydrate with neon, which is a guest molecule with the highest atomic number. The structure of hydrate with neon is different from that with hydrogen. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The structure of hydrate with neon is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. The results provide a new strategy for the design of hydrates with other guest molecules. This work also provides a new way to study the structure of hydrate with guest molecules."

Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the genomes and transcriptomes of two distantly related myxozoan species and a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results show that myxozoans are a sister group to the less reduced cnidarian parasite and that the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite was accompanied by a reduction in genome size and gene content. These results provide insights into the origin of the Myxozoa and the extreme reduction in gene content and genome size that is characteristic of parasitic cnidarians.

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We found that SARS-CoV-2 Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to antagonize the antiviral immune response and could be useful to design new strategies to combat the ongoing pandemic.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

This study quantifies the magnitude of this increase and its consequences for global food security. We find that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields will increase to values much larger than present-day values in most of the world’s major maize-producing countries. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields. For the top four maize-exporting countries, which account for 87% of global maize exports, the probability that they have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. They also underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance."

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is largely unknown because species-level identification of food plants is prohibitively difficult with traditional methods. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammals in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results highlight the importance of diet composition in understanding the causes and consequences of LMH diversity. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

However, the magnitude of the problem is still unknown. We show that the global load of floating plastic debris is far less than expected.

This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean.

The effective CPUE of most countries in 2015 was a fifth of its 1950s value, which was compared with a global decline in abundance. There are signs, however, of stabilization and more effective management in recent years, with a reduction in fleet sizes in developed countries.

No treatment is currently available to slow down the aggressive neurodegenerative process, and patients die within a few years after disease onset.

Several studies point to α-syn oligomerization and aggregation as a mediator of neurotoxicity in synucleinopathies including MSA. We present here an in vivo proof of concept of the ability of the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 to mitigate α-syn pathology and to mediate neuroprotection in a mouse model of MSA. VX-765 prevented motor deficits in the model and reduced the load of truncated α-syn in the striatum. VX-765 showed neuroprotective effects by preserving tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in the substantia nigra.

The Hb system is also a target of the let-7 microRNA (miRNA) pathway. Here we investigated the role of the insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) in the heterochronic regulation of Hb expression in human erythroid tissues. We found that IGF2BP1 is down-regulated in fetal versus adult erythroid tissues. In vitro overexpression of IGF2BP1 in erythroid cells resulted in a reversal of the adult Hb expression pattern toward a more fetal-like phenotype. This was achieved by increased gamma-globin expression and decreased beta-globin expression. The fetal-like Hb expression was mediated by reduced protein expression of the transcription factor BCL11A. These results suggest a mechanism for chronoregulation of Hb expression in humans.

This resistance is mediated by the induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. Furthermore, we show that SREBP1-mediated ferroptosis resistance can be overcome by targeting the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. These findings have important implications for the development of combination therapies for cancer. (Read more)"

The underlying molecular mechanisms of hypertension-induced heart failure are not fully understood. Here, we show that the three major classes of L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs) activate store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which is mediated by the L-type Ca2+ channel (Cav1.2). LCCBs act on the STIM N terminus to cause STIM relocalization to junctions and subsequent ORAI activation in a Cav1.2-independent and store depletion-independent manner. LCCB-induced promotion of vascular remodeling requires STIM1, which is up-regulated in VSMCs from hypertensive rats. Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. Our findings unravel a mechanism of LCCBs action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. This study provides a rationale for the use of LCCBs in the treatment of"

We used &gt;25 years of bird surveys to evaluate the influence of this policy on biodiversity. Our results show that the NWFP halted the decline of early-seral ecosystems but failed to reverse the decline of older forests. The NWFP also failed to halt the decline of older-forest–associated bird populations. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure. Our findings also highlight the importance of monitoring and adaptive management in policy evaluation. This is the first study to evaluate the influence of the NWFP on bird populations. Our findings provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the influence of a policy on biodiversity. This is important because policy evaluation is often difficult and costly. Our findings can be used to inform policy evaluation in other areas.

We then synthesized the top-ranked compounds and tested them in vitro for their inhibitory activity. We also evaluated the compounds in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters, and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data.

Here, we show that CTLA-4 deletion in adult mice results in spontaneous lymphoproliferation, hypergammaglobulinemia, and histologically evident pneumonitis, gastritis, insulitis, and sialadenitis. This was not fatal, but led to organ-specific autoantibodies. CTLA-4 deletion induced preferential expansion of CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells. However, T cells from CTLA-4–deficient inducible KO mice were able to adoptively transfer the diseases into T cell-deficient mice. This indicates that CTLA-4 deficiency affects both central and peripheral tolerance and Treg cell-mediated suppression. Thus, CTLA-4 is a key regulator of both self-tolerance and autoimmunity.

We reconstructed the evolutionary history of beetles using a comprehensive dataset of genes from 521 species. Our analyses resolved the evolutionary history of beetles and revealed that plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles. These novel genes triggered adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles, resulting in nearly half of all living beetle species. We propose that PCWDEs enabled efficient digestion of plant tissues, including lignocellulose in cell walls, facilitating the evolution of uniquely specialized plant-feeding habits, such as leaf mining and stem and wood boring. Beetle diversity thus appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding PCWDEs.

However, current inhibitors cannot distinguish between TRAP1 and HSP90, the target of many existing drugs. We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor.

Severing is a key process in many cellular processes, including cell motility and cytokinesis. However, how ADF severes filaments in a physiological context, where filaments are interconnected and under mechanical stress, remains unclear. Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to study the action of ADF in different mechanical situations. We find that local curvature favors severing, while tension surprisingly has no effect on ADF binding and weakly enhances severing. Remarkably, we observe that filament segments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist, experience a mechanical torque upon ADF binding. We find that this ADF-induced torque dramatically enhances severing. A simple model, which faithfully recapitulates our experimental observations, indicates that the ADF-induced torque increases the severing rate constant 100-fold. We propose that this mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. This mechanism may be important in many cellular processes, including cytokinesis. This work provides a mechanistic explanation for how ADF severes filaments in a"

The disease is characterized by chronic inflammation, which is most often attributed to sustained microglial activation in response to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque deposits and cell death. However, this reaction is observed in transgenic animal models devoid of such pathologies. We propose that this plaque-independent inflammatory reaction originates from neurons burdened with increasing levels of soluble and oligomeric Aβ, which are known to be the most toxic amyloid species within the brain. Laser microdissection of neurons extracted from preplaque amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic rats revealed that neurons produce a variety of potent immune factors, both at the transcript and protein levels. Neuron-derived cytokines correlated with the extent of microglial activation and mobilization, even in the absence of extracellular plaques and cell death. We also demonstrate within disease-vulnerable regions of the human brain that a neuron-specific inflammatory response may precede insoluble Aβ plaque and tau tangle formation. Thus, we reveal the Aβ-burdened neuron as a primary proinflammatory agent, implicating the intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ as a significant immunological component in the AD pathogenesis.

The intermediate is the obligatory pathway on the way to the native state. The intermediate is composed of segments that are distant in the sequence but adjacent in the native protein. The intermediate is the first step on the folding pathway, and it is the site of three destabilizing mutations.

The antifungal activity was associated with the binding to bioactive phosphoinositides and the disruption of the fungal cell wall.

However, the extent to which the female reproductive tract contributes to the life history of sperm is largely unknown. We combined proteomics and isotopic labeling to characterize the posttesticular life history of the Drosophila sperm proteome. We show that the sperm proteome undergoes substantial compositional changes after being transferred to the female reproductive tract. Multiple seminal fluid proteins initially associate with sperm, but most become undetectable after sperm are stored. Female-derived proteins also begin to associate with sperm immediately after mating, and they comprise nearly 20% of the postmating sperm proteome following 4 d of storage in the female reproductive tract. Female-derived proteins that associate with sperm are enriched for processes associated with energy metabolism, suggesting that female contributions support sperm viability during the prolonged period between copulation and fertilization. Our research provides a comprehensive characterization of sperm proteome dynamics and expands our understanding of the critical process of sperm–FRT interactions. (Read more)"

Platelet function is altered in von Willebrand disease (VWD), a common disorder. We show that force application switches VWF to a second state with faster on-rate, providing a mechanism for activating VWF binding to platelets. Switching occurs near 10 pN, a force that also induces a state of the receptor−ligand complex with slower off-rate. Force greatly increases the effects of VWD mutations, explaining pathophysiology.

However, the ACI is difficult to be well represented in current climate models. This is because of the lack of observational capability. To overcome this conundrum, we introduce the dual-FOV high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) for simultaneously profiling aerosol and water cloud properties. This instrument can provide high-resolution and simultaneous observations of aerosols and clouds. We conducted continuous observations of aerosols and clouds over Beijing using this instrument. The observations show that increased aerosol loading led to increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius. However, this finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations obtained from the dual-FOV HSRL constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI process. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI. This paper is expected to provide a significant contribution to the ACI research."

We induced C-type inactivation in BK channels and studied the relationship between activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery. We observed prominent slow C-type inactivation/recovery in BK channels by an extreme low concentration of extracellular K+ together with a Y294E/K/Q/S or Y279F mutation whose equivalent in Shaker channels (T449E/K/D/Q/S or W434F) caused a greatly accelerated rate of C-type inactivation or constitutive C-inactivation.

We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

We found that each additional word or phrase contributed a similar amount of additional brain activity, suggesting that the brain applies the same merge operation to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity. More superficial models of language, based solely on sequential transition probability over lexical and syntactic categories, only captured activity in the posterior middle temporal gyrus. Formal model comparison indicated that the model of multiword phrase construction provided a better fit than probability-based models at most sites in superior temporal and inferior frontal cortices. Activity in those regions was consistent with a neural implementation of a bottom-up or left-corner parser of the incoming language stream.

Globally, fossil-fuel-related emissions account for about 65% of the excess mortality, and 70% of the climate cooling by anthropogenic aerosols. The chemical influence of air pollution on aeolian dust contributes to the aerosol cooling. Since aerosols mask the anthropogenic rise in global temperature, removing pollution particles liberates 0.73 °C, reaching around 2 °C over North America and Northeast Asia. The steep temperature increase from removing aerosols can be moderated to about 0.36 °C globally by the simultaneous reduction of tropospheric ozone and methane.

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, we found that women’s and men’s endorsement of hegemonic masculinity predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. In addition, as conceptualized, hegemonic masculinity predicted less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia, but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors. The findings highlight the importance of psychological examinations of masculinity as a cultural ideology to understand how men’s and women’s endorsement of hegemonic masculinity legitimizes patriarchal dominance and reinforces gender, race, and class-based hierarchies via candidate support.

These practices include reduced tillage, diversified crop rotations with cover crops and legumes, and manure addition. We also show that the magnitude of the SOC response to these practices is highly dependent on the region of the world and the type of soil. Our results highlight the potential of well-managed grasslands to increase SOC storage in agricultural landscapes. This is important because grasslands are the most extensive land use on the planet and are a key component of climate-smart agriculture.

We find that the genetic ancestry of men closely resembles modern northern and central Europeans, while women exhibit a very high genetic heterogeneity. This heterogeneity includes signals of genetic ancestry ranging from western Europe to East Asia. Particularly striking are women with artificial skull deformations; the analysis of their collective genetic ancestry suggests an origin in southeastern Europe. In addition, functional variants revealed that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how HKU4 and HKU5 transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4.

The process is highly processive and requires the sliding clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) to maintain the stability of the polymerase holoenzyme. We developed unique kinetic assays to measure the processivity and stability of the polymerase holoenzyme. We found that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. Our results suggest that the human pol δ holoenzyme is more similar to the S. cerevisiae pol δ holoenzyme than previously thought. This finding has implications for the evolution of the human cell. The human cell has evolved to maintain a high rate of DNA replication in the absence of PCNA. Our results suggest that the human cell has evolved a more dynamic pol δ holoenzyme to maintain the high rate of DNA replication.

In the hypothesized RNA world, before the evolution of proteins, genetic information was stored in RNA molecules that were replicated by ribozymes. In the laboratory, RNA molecules can be evolved to have catalytic activity, and in this paper, we show that RNA molecules can also have polymerase activity. We used in vitro evolution to improve the polymerase activity of an RNA molecule, and we demonstrated that the improved polymerase can synthesize a variety of functional RNA molecules, including aptamers, ribozymes, and tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins.

Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

The first pocket Bibles were made in the 13th century. The source of this parchment, often called “uterine vellum,” has been a long-standing controversy in codicology. Here, we report a simple and objective method to identify the animal origin of parchment. The noninvasive method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals; however, we did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides. These results suggest that ultrafine vellum does not necessarily derive from the use of abortive or newborn animals with ultrathin hides, but could equally well reflect a production process that allowed the skins of maturing animals of several species to be rendered into vellum of equal quality and fineness"

The age model for this event is critical for understanding its cause and the controls on extinction/recovery dynamics. We present a precise age model for the extinction based on U-Pb dating of volcanic ash beds. The age of the extinction is 251.941 ± 0.037 and 251.880 ± 0.031 Mya, an interval of 60 ± 48 ka. The carbon cycle reorganization that preceded the extinction is punctuated by a sharp (3‰) negative spike in the isotopic composition of carbonate carbon. The carbon cycle volatility persists for ∼500 ka before a return to near preextinction values. Decamillenial to millennial level resolution of the mass extinction and its aftermath will permit a refined evaluation of the relative roles of rate-dependent processes contributing to the extinction. This will establish an accurate time point for evaluating the plausibility of trigger and kill mechanisms. The age model will also be useful in evaluating the potential for a repeat of the Permian-Triassic extinction"

RORαΔIEC mice exhibit excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs.

We find that reductions in human demography have suppressed global fire activity throughout the 20th century, but recent and predicted future reductions in fire activity may enhance land carbon uptake and reduce warming by up to 0.11 °C by 2100. We show that ignitions and active and passive fire suppression can be as important in driving future fire regimes as changes in climate. However, with some risk of more extreme fires regionally.

This pandemic is generally understood as the consequence of a singular introduction of Yersinia pestis, after which the disease established itself in European rodents over four centuries. To locate these putative plague reservoirs, we studied the climate fluctuations that preceded regional plague epidemics, based on a dataset of 7,711 georeferenced historical plague outbreaks and 15 annually resolved tree-ring records from Europe and Asia.

We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR).

The molecular signature of the transition from autotrophy to a nonphotosynthetic parasitic lifestyle is still poorly understood. We present a model of the trajectory of plastid genome evolution during the transition from autotrophy to a parasitic lifestyle. We show that the loss of photosynthesis is linked to the establishment of a parasitic lifestyle, characterized by the parasite’s dependence on a host to fulfill its life cycle. Our findings suggest that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner.

We use a high-resolution climate model to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the probability of occurrence of multiyear rainfall deficits in southwestern South Africa. We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% by the year 2100 under an intermediate-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5) and to 80% under a high-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5-8.5). These results highlight the strong sensitivity of the drought risk in SSA to future anthropogenic emissions.

Photosynthesis relies on these modified tetrapyrroles for the capture of solar radiation and its conversion to chemical energy. The formation of the isocyclic fifth ring, the key reaction in the biosynthesis of (bacterio)chlorophylls, has remained enigmatic for more than 60 y. This reaction is catalyzed by two unrelated cyclase enzymes using different chemistries. The majority of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria use a [4Fe-4S] cluster protein, whereas plants, cyanobacteria, and some phototrophic bacteria possess a diiron protein. Plant and cyanobacterial mutants in ycf54 display impaired function of the diiron enzyme, accumulating the reaction substrate. Swapping cyclases between cyanobacteria and purple phototrophic bacteria reveals three classes of the diiron enzyme. A diiron cyclase is required in a betaproteobacterium, whereas alphaproteobacterial cyclases require a newly discovered protein, encoded by a gene conserved in these organisms. These data delineate three classes of diiron cyclase in chlorophototrophic organisms from higher plants to bacteria, and their evolution is discussed herein"

The etiology of autism is so complicated because it involves the effects of variants of several hundred risk genes along with the contribution of environmental factors. Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. As an alternative approach, extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying the convergence of the targets and functions of the autism-risk genes to facilitate mapping out causal paths. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that the reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the causal paths that lead to autism.

The disease is caused by the aggregation of mutant proteins, which are highly aggregation-prone and form intracellular inclusion bodies. Here, we show that the inclusion bodies in ALS are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. To explain the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in the brain and spinal cord, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. This study provides a new perspective on the pathogenesis of ALS and suggests that the disease is caused by a progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in motor neurons.

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis remain unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We found that the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion. For the N3-EtdT lesion that disrupts base pairing, multiple transcriptional lesion bypass routes were found. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop). The Pro-Gate loop faces toward the minor groove of RNA:DNA hybrid and is involved in modulating the translocation of minor-groove alkylated DNA template after"

Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. These findings suggest that the first cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence.

What are the effects of vote-by-mail? In this paper, we provide a comprehensive design-based analysis of the effect of universal vote-by-mail—a policy under which every voter is mailed a ballot in advance of the election—on electoral outcomes. We find that 1) universal vote-by-mail does not appear to affect either party’s share of turnout, 2) universal vote-by-mail does not appear to increase either party’s vote share, and 3) universal vote-by-mail modestly increases overall average turnout rates, in line with previous estimates. All three conclusions support the conventional wisdom of election administration experts and contradict many popular claims in the media.

Herein, using global STING knockout (STING−/−) and β-cell–specific STING knockout (STING-βKO) mouse models, we revealed a distinct role of STING in the regulation of glucose homeostasis through peripheral tissues and β-cells. Specially, although STING−/− beneficially alleviated insulin resistance and glucose intolerance induced by high-fat diet, it surprisingly impaired islet glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), suggesting a possible role of STING in β-cell dysfunction. Indeed, STING-βKO caused glucose intolerance due to impaired GSIS, indicating that STING is required for normal β-cell function.

In contrast, in Parkinson’s disease (PD), this RSN was subordinated to an independent disease-related pattern. Network functionality was assessed by quantifying metabolic RSN expression in cerebral blood flow PET scans acquired at rest and during task performance.

Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

We show that the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is sensitive to changes in temperature. As temperatures deviate from ambient conditions, the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning becomes steeper, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result is driven by two processes: (i) more diverse communities have a greater chance of including species with thermal traits that enable them to maintain productivity as temperatures shift from ambient conditions, and (ii) the contribution of complementarity to the net biodiversity effect increases at high and low temperatures, indicating that changes in species interactions play a critical role in mediating the impacts of temperature change on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

But how do we know when two people are connected? We asked pairs of friends and strangers to talk with each other and rated their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Finally, we demonstrate that this signal is used by third-party listeners as a heuristic of how well people are connected: Conversations with faster response times were perceived as more connected than the same conversations with slower response times. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

This suggests that their plumes become trapped and then overlap in the nearshore zone, increasing the likelihood of coastal eutrophication. Our findings reveal an underappreciated role that small streams may play in driving coastal eutrophication in large water bodies. Expanding nutrient management efforts to address smaller watersheds could reduce the ecological impacts of nutrient loading on valuable nearshore ecosystems. This article is protected by copyright.

We find that the long-time dynamics of such systems are biased toward states that exhibit a fine-tuned extremization of environmental forcing. This behavior is reminiscent of the “saddle-node” bifurcation in dynamical systems, which is a well-known phenomenon in the study of stability. We also find that the dynamics of the system are sensitive to the details of the environment, and that the system can exhibit a variety of behaviors depending on the environment. These results have implications for the study of complex systems in general, and for the study of chemical systems in particular."

Here we show that NMDAR-Abs change the intrinsic microcircuitry of the brain, which in turn can lead to paroxysmal EEG abnormalities. We validate a dynamic causal model of NMDAR-Ab effects on cortical microcircuitry and show that the same key synaptic parameters that best explain EEG paroxysms in pediatric patients with NMDAR-Ab encephalitis can be used to explain the same parameters in a mouse model. These findings offer mechanistic insights into circuit-level dysfunction induced by NMDAR-Abs. They also suggest that the same parameters that are tolerated in the in silico model of the control condition can be used to predict the susceptibility of the brain to overt EEG paroxysms when these parameters are changed. This could lead to the development of biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

To understand the Earth system response to abrupt climate change, we need to know how the system responded to gradual climate change. Here, we present a study of a 300-million-year-old abrupt climate change event that occurred during a glacial period. We show that the event was accompanied by a global warming and a biodiversity nadir. We also show that the event was linked to an increase in organic matter burial and to an increase in nutrient fluxes. These results can help us understand the Earth system response to rapid climate change. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

We show that RSPO certification is associated with reduced deforestation in oil palm plantations. However, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results suggest that certification is not a silver bullet for palm oil, but rather a tool that can be used in conjunction with other policies to reduce deforestation. We also show that certification is not a substitute for other policies that reduce deforestation, such as the moratorium on new concessions. Our results are important for the palm oil industry and for policy makers considering the use of certification as a tool to reduce deforestation."

In humans, its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. Investigation of the dynamic regulation of the evolutionarily conserved exocyst-related processes using mutants in genetically tractable organisms such as Arabidopsis thaliana is limited by the lethality or the severity of phenotypes. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 (exocyst component of 70 kDa) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and offers a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Read more)"

In vertebrates, sex is determined by a single locus, which can be male- or female-determining. In species with a single locus, the sex of an individual is determined by the sex of the parent, and the sex of the offspring is determined by the sex of the parent. In species with multiple loci, the sex of an individual is determined by the sex of the parent, but the sex of the parent is determined by the sex of the parent. This can lead to a variety of outcomes, including the maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles. We show that the multiple loci of polygenic sex determination can lead to modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics."

We sought to understand how Fe levels impact the retina, given that retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are also challenged by accumulations of vitamin A aldehyde adducts (bisretinoids) that photogenerate reactive oxygen species and photodecompose into damaging aldehyde- and dicarbonyl-bearing species. We found that intracellular Fe promotes bisretinoid oxidation and degradation. This interpretation was supported by experiments showing that Fe chelation decreased the oxidative/degradation of the bisretinoid A2E in the presence of light and reduced cell death in cell-based experiments. Moreover, light-independent oxidation and degradation of A2E by Fenton chemistry products were evidenced by the consumption of A2E, release of dicarbonyls, and generation of oxidized A2E species in cell-free assays. These findings indicate that Fe is a key factor in the photodegradation of bisretinoids in the retina. Understanding the role of Fe in the photodegradation of bisretinoids may be important for the development of strategies to protect the retina from the damaging effects of light"

However, the evolution of specialization is often considered a dead end. We show that siphonophores, a group of predators that are highly specialized on a single prey type, can evolve into generalists. This is possible because the evolution of specialization is linked to the evolution of morphological innovations. Our findings help understand how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs."

The evolution of the human hand is a key to understanding our origins and evolution. However, the evolution of the human hand is poorly understood because of a lack of fossil evidence from before 1.8 My ago. Here we show that the third metacarpal styloid process, a key derived feature of the human hand, was present in a 1.42-Myr-old fossil from Kenya. This finding suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato. This study also provides the earliest evidence for the evolution of a key shared derived characteristic of modern human and Neandertal hand morphology. These findings have implications for understanding the evolution of the human hand and the origins of modern human behavior. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

We have developed a small-molecule inhibitor of both human cytosolic and mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferse (SHMT). We show that dual SHMT inhibition blocks colon cancer tumor growth in mice. We also show that SHMT inhibition is particularly effective in B-cell lines, and that this effect is rooted in defective glycine import. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. This work provides a rationale for the use of SHMT inhibition in the treatment of cancer, and suggests that targeting the glycine import pathway is a promising strategy for the treatment of lymphoma.

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants.
