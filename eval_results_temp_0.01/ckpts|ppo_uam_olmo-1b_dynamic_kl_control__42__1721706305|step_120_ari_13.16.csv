The evolution of the male–female sex ratio has been the focus of much debate. However, the evolutionary history of the male–female sex ratio has been less well-studied. Here, we investigate the evolution of the male–female sex ratio in the Metriaclima marmota species complex (M. marmota) using a phylogenetic and quantitative analysis of the male–female sex ratio. We find that the evolution of the male–female sex ratio in M. marmota has been driven by a combination of sex-linked and autosomal loci. We also show that the evolution of the male–female sex ratio in M. marmota has been driven by a combination of sex-linked and autosomal loci.
