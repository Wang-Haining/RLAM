The disease is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus has a complex life cycle that involves the host immune system. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to block the nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, which are key factors in the induction of IFN-stimulated genes. We found that the viral accessory protein Orf6 is responsible for this activity. We also show that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and interacts with Nup98-Rae1, which is involved in the nuclear import of STAT1 and STAT2. Our results unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the host immune response and may lead to the development of new strategies to combat the pandemic.

However, the extent to which different species partition food resources at the level of individual species is largely unknown. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammals in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in body size and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.

This work represents a key milestone toward the development of a synthetic plant-controlled symbiosis in which the bacteria fix nitrogen only when in contact with the desired host plant and are prevented from interaction with nontarget plant species. This work also provides a proof of concept for the use of rhizopine as a synthetic signal for the control of symbiosis. This synthetic system may be used to develop a new generation of nitrogen-fixing crops that are more sustainable and efficient. (Show more)"

The spider’s web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna, which is more sensitive to acoustic signals than the spider itself. The spider can detect the direction and location of the source of the sound, and can even localize the sound in three dimensions. The spider can also adjust the size of its web to the sound intensity, and can regenerate the web to keep it in good condition. The outsourcing and supersizing of auditory function in spiders provides unique features for studying extended and regenerative sensing and designing novel acoustic flow detectors for precise fluid dynamic measurement and manipulation. This study also provides a unique example of outsourcing hearing in animals."

Our results suggest that the pathogen underwent a series of evolutionary steps before its emergence, and that it rapidly spread across Eurasia. These data provide insights into the early history of plague and its adaptation to its vector, the flea.

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, HM predicted support for Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. HM was associated with less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors. The findings highlight the importance of psychological examinations of masculinity as a cultural ideology to understand how men’s and women’s endorsement of HM legitimizes patriarchal dominance and reinforces gender, race, and class-based hierarchies via candidate support. They also have implications for understanding the political and social consequences of the endorsement of HM."

In this study, we found that neuroinflammation was reduced in both the early and later stages of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in microglia/macrophage-specific ASK1 knockout mice, whereas only the later-stage neuroinflammation was ameliorated in astrocyte-specific ASK1 knockout mice. ASK1 signaling in microglia played a major role in generating and maintaining disease, and astrocytes produced key inflammatory mediators, including CCL2, that further activated and recruited microglia/macrophages. Our findings suggest that glial ASK1 is a promising therapeutic target for reducing neuroinflammation. This study provides a better understanding of the roles of ASK1 in the glial cells and may lead to the development of new strategies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility in autism and may facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies. This study also provides a framework for the analysis of the effects of variants of several hundred risk genes in the etiology of autism. This framework can be extended to other complex disorders with a complicated etiology."

However, the mechanisms that regulate SAN function are not fully understood. Here, we report that stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is a key regulator of SAN function. We found that STIM1 is expressed in the specialized cardiomyocytes of the SAN, and its deletion in mice resulted in a reduction in the size of the Ca2+ stores of the SAN, leading to a reduction in heart rate. These results suggest that STIM1 is a multifunctional regulator of Ca2+ dynamics in the SAN that links the size of the Ca2+ stores with electrical events occurring in the plasma membrane, thereby contributing to automaticity of the SAN.

We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We hypothesize that the roaming of sauropods, the largest terrestrial animals that ever lived, would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants.
