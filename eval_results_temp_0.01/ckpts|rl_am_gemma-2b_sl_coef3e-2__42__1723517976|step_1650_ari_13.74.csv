The structure of hydrate with neon is found to be thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. The structure of hydrate with neon is also found to be different from that with methane. The structure of hydrate with neon is expected to provide a reference for the structure of hydrate with other guest molecules.

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes. Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.

These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

However, the extent to which species differ in their diets is difficult to quantify because of the time and labor required to identify species-specific plant remains. We show that DNA metabarcoding can be used to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven species of large herbivores in a semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between species, even when they were matched in body size and digestive physiology. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages, and that the diversity of large herbivores may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.

The development of new antibiotics is a major challenge for the scientific community. We present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. The best candidates were tested in vitro and in vivo, and the results show that the best compounds designed by us are up to 56 times more active against resistant pathogens than telithromycin. Notably, the best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

However, the number of trainable parameters in these networks is often very large, making it difficult to train and apply the networks in practice. Here, we introduce a network architecture based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters, and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data."

TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness.

The island is located ∼400 km from the east coast of Africa, but its genetic and linguistic traits are from both Southeast Asia and Eastern Africa. We used a grid-based approach to sample the genomic diversity across Madagascar and found that the population is a mixture of Bantu and Austronesian people. The settlement history of Madagascar is also debated, and we found that the population has a recent common Bantu and Austronesian ancestry. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. This study provides a new perspective on the human history of Madagascar. It also provides a framework for the study of the human history of other islands in the Indian Ocean."

The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel is a type-3 channel, which has no classic activation gate and shows no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is state-dependent, and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. We propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. This study provides a new perspective on the regulation of ion channels.

There is an urgent need for novel and more efficient therapies, ideally targeting AML stem cells that are essential for maintaining the disease. Here, we show that monoclonal antibodies targeting the IL1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. We also show that an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling can suppress the proliferation of primary human AML cells. These results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. Furthermore, the results suggest that IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Thus, our results provide important insights into the biology of AML and may lead to the development of new and more efficient therapies for this disease."

The island is located ∼400 km from the east coast of Africa, but its genetic and linguistic diversity is from both Southeast Asia and Eastern Africa. We used a grid-based approach to sample the genomic diversity across Madagascar and found that the population is a mixture of Bantu and Austronesian populations, with a limited contribution from Europe and the Middle East. The distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. These results provide insights into the human history of Madagascar and the processes that shaped the island’s population. They also provide a framework for the study of the human history of other islands."

Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (denoted GlpD) and increases dehydrogenase activity. We also found that the RNA that encodes AzuC interferes with the ability of the RNA to repress carbon utilization genes. These results demonstrate that the translation and base-pairing functions of the RNA compete. This is an example of a dual-function RNA that has been overlooked in the past. We believe that this work will lead to a better understanding of the evolution of dual-function RNAs and their role in bacterial physiology. (Show more)"

In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

We connect changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods with economic and demographic data and find that three factors predict neighborhood improvement: (i) the density of college-educated adults, (ii) the initial appearance of the neighborhood, and (iii) the proximity of the neighborhood to other attractive neighborhoods. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities. Our method can be used to monitor the physical changes in any city over time. We hope that our work will inspire others to use computer vision methods to study the physical dynamics of cities."

We show that the rate of viral production is rapid, and the lifetime of an infected cell while producing virus is ∼5 h. We also show that the median time to undetectable plasma viral load can be reduced from ∼5 d to ∼3 d with a drug concentration ∼15 times the drug’s EC50 when treatment is given prophylactically starting at the time of infection. In the case of favipiravir, a polymerase inhibitor with activity against ZIKV, we predict a dose of 150 mg/kg given twice a day initiated at the time of infection can reduce the peak median viral load by ∼3 logs and shorten the time to undetectable median viral load by ∼2 d. These results can help guide the development of effective antiviral strategies for the control of ZIKV. (Show more)"

However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis is driven by altered nutrient cycling, which is a consequence of the increased metabolic energy demand of the coral host. This feedback loop is a key factor in the early stages of bleaching and may help to explain the stability of the coral–algal symbiosis in the face of environmental change. Our findings provide a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help to predict the fate of coral reefs in a changing climate."

We demonstrate that inhibiting JNK signaling or depleting the microbiome restores barrier function, leading to a reestablishment of host–microbe homeostasis, and organismal lifespan extension. Our work identifies a JNK-dependent feedback amplification loop between intestinal tumors and the microbiome, and it highlights the importance of controlling the activity level of JNK signaling to maintain epithelial barrier function and host–microbe homeostasis.

Our results suggest that Si and JA interact to promote plant defense against insect herbivores. This study provides insights into the role of Si in plant defense and may lead to the development of Si-based strategies for insect pest management. (Show more)"

We show that the majority of nutrient loads to the world’s fifth largest lake, Lake Michigan, are delivered by a small fraction of its tributaries. Although the largest tributaries are the most important in terms of total loads, the nutrient loads from smaller tributaries are high for their size and biased toward dissolved inorganic forms. This suggests that nutrient inputs from small tributaries may be more likely to fuel algal blooms in the nearshore zone, where these large water bodies are most valuable for recreation and commerce. Our findings highlight the importance of small tributaries in driving coastal nutrient pollution and provide a framework for targeting nutrient management efforts to reduce the ecological impacts of nutrient pollution in large water bodies."

However, most studies focused on short-term warming events superimposed on longer-term greenhouse climate states. Here, we present an integrated proxy (carbon and uranium [U] isotopes and paleo CO2) and multicomponent modeling approach to investigate an abrupt C perturbation and global warming event (∼304 Ma) that occurred during a paleo-glacial state. We show that the event can be linked to an injection of organic matter–derived C and to near 20% of areal extent of seafloor anoxia. The event is linked to enhanced thermocline stratification and nutrient fluxes during an icehouse. This work provides insights into the history of C perturbations and the response of the Earth system to abrupt warming. (Show more)"

We show that RSPO certification reduces deforestation in oil palm plantations, but the impact is small and limited to areas that are already degraded. Certification has no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results highlight the need for certification schemes to be more effective in reducing deforestation and fire in the remaining forest of the world."

We show that the levels of iron in the retina, as reflected in the transferrin receptor, impact the levels of lipofuscin. This finding is important because iron is a key component of the Fenton reaction, which is the source of reactive oxygen species in the retina. Thus, the levels of iron in the retina may impact the levels of lipofuscin, which in turn may impact vision.
