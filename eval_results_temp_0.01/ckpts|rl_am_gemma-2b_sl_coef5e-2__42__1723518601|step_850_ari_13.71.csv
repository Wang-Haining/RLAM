The properties of hydrates are of great importance in many fields, such as oil and gas extraction, chemical engineering, and environmental protection. However, the formation mechanism of hydrates is still not fully understood. In this work, we report the formation of hydrate with neon, which is a rare element. The results provide a new perspective for the study of the formation mechanism of hydrates. This work also provides a new method for the study of the formation of hydrates, which is of great significance for the development of hydrate technology."

However, it is not a theory that is easy to understand. This is partly because it is a non-classical theory, in the sense that it does not fit into the classical framework of logic and set theory. In this paper, we provide a purely categorical approach to quantum theory. This approach does not presuppose any analytical structure, and it is therefore applicable to any non-classical theory. We show that quantum mechanics is equivalent to a category of the same type as the category of continuous linear operators between Hilbert spaces. This provides a mathematical foundation for quantum theory that is independent of any particular analytical framework."

The evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, and a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species, Kudoa iwatai and Myxobolus cerebralis, and compare these to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results show that the myxozoan body plan is reduced to the essential elements required for parasitism, and that the genome is reduced in size and gene content. These findings suggest that the transition from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic myxozoan was accompanied by a dramatic reduction in genome size and gene content. This is the first time to our knowledge that a myxozoan genome has been sequenced, and our results provide a unique resource for future studies of the evolution of the Myxozoa and the origin of parasitism."

The SARS-CoV-2 virus is able to evade the host immune response by blocking the nuclear import of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are essential for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). In this study, we show that the viral accessory protein Orf6 is responsible for this evasion mechanism. We demonstrate that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and interacts with Nup98-Rae1, a protein complex that is essential for the nuclear import of ISGs. We also show that a simple mutation in Orf6 abolishes its ability to block nuclear import and impair IFN signaling. Our findings provide a mechanism of viral antagonism that could be used by other pathogens to evade the host immune response.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa in herbivore feces. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large herbivore species in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These findings suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages, and that large herbivore diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our findings have implications for the management of large herbivore populations in African savanna and elsewhere."

We show that the global load of plastic debris on the open ocean surface is far less than expected, on the order of tens of thousands of tons. This is due to the size-selective sinks of plastic debris in the open ocean, which involve the fast nano-fragmentation of plastic debris into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

A Threonine to Alanine substitution at this position was studied in three representative members of the K+-channel family.

We further show that microinfusion of specific mitochondrial inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduces social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious animals. Finally, we show that nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3, which enhances brain energy metabolism, prevents the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious individuals.

The structures are digitally synthesized through a free-form inverse design approach, which is based on the principle of the least constraint energy. The synthesized structures exhibit organic shapes and motions with irregular distributions of material phases.

Here, we show that the activation of this pathway protects cancer cells from oxidative stress and ferroptosis through the induction of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a key regulator of lipid metabolism. We also show that the combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction results in near-complete tumor regression in preclinical models. These findings suggest that the activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment in which ferroptosis induction is desired. (Read more)"

We also show that the early-seral ecosystem area was stable, but declined in two ecoregions—the Coast Range and Cascades—along with early-seral bird populations. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure. This will require a continued focus on the development of older-forest structure and the maintenance of early-seral ecosystems."

The best candidates were then tested in vivo against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. The best compound designed by us is up to 56 times more active than telithromycin, a clinically used antibiotic, and is more accessible, exhibits higher binding affinity to the ribosome, and is more soluble than the best compound identified by screening. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

Our results show that the origin of beetles coincides with the first appearance of genes encoding enzymes that digest plant cell walls, and that these genes triggered a series of adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles. Thus, the evolution of beetles appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding enzymes that digest plant cell walls.

We also found that APOE4 increases the rate of C1q accumulation in the brain, which may represent the accumulation of senescent synapses with enhanced vulnerability to complement-mediated neurodegeneration. These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes.

Our results also suggest that the vector of the Second Pandemic plague was different from the vector of the first plague pandemic (13–18th centuries), which led to the Black Death (1347–1353).

TRAP1 is a member of the HSP90 family that is found predominantly in mitochondria. TRAP1 is considered to be an anticancer target, but current inhibitors cannot distinguish between HSP90 and TRAP1, making their utility as probes of TRAP1-specific function questionable. We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor."

In this study, we show that the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses T4P for surface sensing. This process is mediated by the Chp chemosensory system, which regulates the production of cAMP and the expression of hundreds of genes, including key virulence factors. The Chp system is activated by the mechanical activity of T4P, which is required for the long-term attachment of P. aeruginosa to surfaces. Our findings suggest that T4P are not only involved in surface-specific motility, but also as a mechanosensitive sensor that regulates the expression of genes involved in surface-induced processes and pathogenicity. This study thus provides a mechanistic explanation for the role of T4P in bacterial surface sensing and virulence. It also suggests that T4P can be a target for the development of new antibacterial strategies. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

This estimate is based on the isotopic composition of marine cherts, which is thought to reflect the temperature of the oceans. However, this estimate has been subject to question due to uncertainties regarding oceanic isotopic compositions, diagenetic or metamorphic resetting of the isotopic record, and depositional environments. We here present a new method for determining the temperature of the early Earth, based on the thermostability of reconstructed ancestral enzymes. Our results suggest that the temperature of the early Earth decreased over geological time.

The BK channel is unique in that it lacks a classic intracellular activation gate and shows no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its rates and extents inversely correlate with channel-open probability. We propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. This study provides a new perspective on the regulation of K+ channels.

In the temperate regions, seasonal outbreaks of influenza virus correlate with decreases in ambient humidity. The impact of humidity on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection in the context of ambient humidity. They also suggest that humidity may be a potential target for the development of therapeutic strategies to reduce the impact of influenza virus infection. This article is protected by copyright.

This pattern of activity is consistent with a bottom-up parser that merges words into phrases, which in turn merge into phrases, and so on, until a sentence is complete.

Here, we demonstrate that the use of a bacterial signal can control the nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the soil and prevent them from competing with the crop.

In the United States, the conversion of grasslands to cropland has led to the release of massive amounts of SOC to the atmosphere. However, the extent to which this trend can be reversed is unknown. We show that soil health management practices can increase SOC storage and the amount of SOC stored in the mineral soil. These practices include reduced tillage, diversified crop rotations with cover crops and legumes, and rotational grazing of pastures. These results highlight the potential for well-managed grasslands to sequester carbon on a global scale.

We show that the genetic ancestry of men is mostly consistent with modern northern and central Europeans, while women exhibit a very high genetic heterogeneity, including signals of genetic ancestry ranging from western Europe to East Asia. This heterogeneity is also reflected in the set of functional variants, which indicates that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions.

The results indicate that the human pol δ maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion.

First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology.

The first pocket Bibles were made in the 13th century, and the source of the parchment, often called “uterine vellum,” has been a long-standing controversy in codicology. The Latin term abortivum in many sources has led some scholars to suggest that fetal calves or sheep skins were used. Others have argued that it would not be possible to sustain herds if so many pocket Bibles were made from fetal skins, arguing instead for unexpected alternatives, such as rabbit. Here, we report a simple and objective method to identify the animal origin of parchment. The noninvasive method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals, but did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides."

The age model for this event is critical for understanding the causes and consequences of the extinction. We present a precise age model for the extinction based on U-Pb dates from five volcanic ash beds. The age of the extinction is 251.941 ± 0.037 and 251.880 ± 0.031 Mya, and the extinction interval is 60 ± 48 ka. The carbon cycle was highly volatile during the extinction, and the recovery was protracted. These results will help to evaluate the plausibility of trigger and kill mechanisms for the extinction. The age model will also be used to evaluate the timing of recovery of the ecosystem, and to assess the role of rate-dependent processes in the extinction. This work will advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of the most severe extinction event in Earth history."

We further demonstrate that RORα/histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3)-mediated NF-κB signaling is critical for the inflammatory response in the intestinal epithelium. Our findings suggest that RORα/HDAC3-mediated NF-κB signaling is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.

We show here that the glycan is provided to the bacteria just before dusk, when the squid is about to start its daily activity.

We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA. Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete."

Neuroactive protein kinase ASK1 has been implicated in neuroinflammation, but its precise cellular and molecular mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we generated conditional knockout (CKO) mice that lack ASK1 in T cells, dendritic cells, microglia/macrophages, microglia, or astrocytes, to assess the roles of ASK1 during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We found that ASK1 deficiency in microglia/macrophages and astrocytes reduced the severity of EAE, whereas ASK1 deficiency in T cells and dendritic cells had no significant effects on EAE. ASK1 signaling in microglia/macrophages played a major role in generating and maintaining disease. Activated astrocytes produce key inflammatory mediators, including CCL2, that further activated and recruited microglia/macrophages, in an astrocytic ASK1-dependent manner. Our findings demonstrate cell-type–specific roles of ASK1 and suggest phase-specific ASK1-dependent glial cell interactions in EAE pathophysiology.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility, which resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral phenotypes of autism-risk genes and may facilitate the identification of the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms.

MTX is a potent immunosuppressant that inhibits the function of leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) to inhibit the generation of the potent lipid chemoattractant leukotriene B4 (LTB4). MTX potently inhibits the proinflammatory proteases plasmin, trypsin, and elastase to induce immune tolerance and maintain high stability.

Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of DLBCL.

We observe that the inclusion bodies in ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

However, the energy density and the selection of negative electrode materials are significantly limited due to the narrow electrochemical stable potential window of aqueous electrolytes. Herein, a type of a negative electrode material is proposed for high-energy aqueous Li-ion batteries. The unique nanosized and metastable characters of the Mo-based oxide lead to a large capacity and low potential without triggering decomposition of water, and a full cell presents high energy density of 107 W ⋅ h ⋅ kg−1 as the maximum value in 21 m LiTFSA aqueous electrolyte, and 73% in capacity retention is achieved after 2,000 cycles. This work combines a high capacity with a safe negative electrode material through delivering the Mo-based oxide with unique nanosized and metastable characters.

In sexually reproducing organisms, recombination is essential for the formation of offspring with unique combinations of genes. In the past, we lacked the tools to precisely map the locations of recombination events in a natural population. Here, we use a population of monkeyflowers to precisely locate over 400,000 boundaries of historic crossovers or gene conversion tracts. The resulting map of recombination activity defines some 13,000 hotspots of varying strengths, interspersed with cold regions of undetectably low recombination. The general pattern is similar to that observed in yeast, as well as in positive-regulatory domain zinc finger protein 9–knockout mice, suggesting that recombination initiation described here in Mimulus may reflect ancient and conserved eukaryotic mechanisms."

This hypothesis has been tested using functional MRI, but the results have been difficult to interpret because of the large number of networks that have been identified. Here, we used metabolic positron emission tomography to identify and validate reproducible RSN topographies in healthy and disease populations. We found that the dominant RSN in healthy subjects was topographically similar to the default mode network. In contrast, in Parkinson’s disease (PD), this RSN was subordinated to an independent disease-related pattern. Network functionality was assessed by quantifying metabolic RSN expression in cerebral blood flow PET scans acquired at rest and during task performance. We found that the dominant RSN was deactivated during rest in healthy subjects and early PD patients, but was activated during task performance in advanced PD. This abnormality was partially corrected by dopaminergic therapy. In contrast, in Alzheimer’s disease, significant reductions in network expression were already present at diagnosis, progressing over time.

We hypothesized that epigenetic DNA-methylation (DNA-me) alterations at specific loci in blood cells are associated with metabolic memory. We found that DNA-me alterations at certain loci in blood cells are associated with glycemia for several years during the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and support an epigenetic explanation for metabolic memory.

However, the role of FSIP1 in the progression and drug sensitivity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. This article is protected by copyright.

Moreover, subjects with increased gut permeability also had altered composition and activity of the gut microbiota. These results suggest the existence of a gut–brain axis in alcohol dependence, which implicates the gut microbiota as an actor in the gut barrier and in behavioral disorders. Thus, the gut microbiota seems to be a previously unidentified target in the management of alcohol dependence.

We show that striatonigral fibers originating in striosomes form highly unusual bouquet-like arborizations that target bundles of ventrally extending dopamine-containing dendrites and clusters of their parent nigral cell bodies.

Thus, these striosome–dendron bouquets likely represent subsystems with the nigro–striato–nigral loop that are affected in human disorders including Parkinson’s disease. Given evidence that striosomes receive input from cortical regions related to the control of mood and motivation and that they link functionally to reinforcement and decision-making, the striosome–dendron bouquets could be critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease.

The history of the C cycle is a history of the history of the Earth system. Here, we present a study of an abrupt warming event that occurred during a glacial period. We show that the event was linked to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 and a biodiversity nadir. We also show that the event was linked to an injection of organic matter–derived carbon and to an increase in nutrient fluxes. We further show that the event was linked to an increase in seafloor anoxia. These results provide insights into the history of the Earth system and the potential for future abrupt warming events.

We show that RSPO certification reduced deforestation in Indonesia from 2001 to 2015. However, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results suggest that certification is not a silver bullet for tropical deforestation, but it is an important tool in the toolbox of policies and programs that aim to reduce tropical deforestation. We recommend that the RSPO and other certification schemes consider the results of this study in their efforts to reduce tropical deforestation. This article is protected by copyright.

It is essential for the regulation of the size and shape of the plasma membrane and the trafficking of the vacuole. The exocyst complex is conserved across kingdoms, and its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and offers a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Read more)"

In vertebrates, sex is determined by a single locus, which can be male- or female-determining. In species with polygenic sex determination, multiple alleles interact to determine sex. In some species, the sex of an individual can be determined by multiple alleles, but the sex of a species is determined by a single allele. Here we investigate the effects of polygenic sex determination on secondary sexual characteristics in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii. We find that the sex of an individual can be determined by multiple alleles, but the sex of the species is determined by a single allele. This modularity of secondary sexual characteristics provides context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations."

The retina is also challenged by the accumulation of vitamin A aldehyde adducts (bisretinoids) that photodecompose into damaging aldehyde- and dicarbonyl-bearing species. We sought to understand how Fe levels impact the retina, given that retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are also challenged by accumulations of bisretinoids that photogenerate reactive oxygen species and photodecompose into damaging aldehyde- and dicarbonyl-bearing species. We found that Fe levels impact the retina by promoting the oxidation and degradation of bisretinoids. These findings have implications for the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in the United States. They also suggest that Fe chelation may be a useful therapeutic strategy for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration. This interpretation was supported by experiments showing that Fe chelation decreased the oxidative/degradation of the bisretinoid A2E in the presence of light and reduced cell death in cell-based experiments. Moreover, light-independent oxidation and degradation of A2E by Fenton chemistry products were evidenced by the consumption of A2E"

However, the evolution of the hand has been poorly understood because of a lack of fossil evidence for the transition from earlier to later hominins. Here we report the discovery of a hand fossil from the Middle Pleistocene to recent hominin site of Hadar, Ethiopia, that shows a key derived feature of the hand, the third metacarpal styloid process, which is present in the hand of a 1.42-Myr-old East African hominin. This fossil provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key shared derived characteristic of modern human and Neandertal hand morphology and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo. This finding has implications for our understanding of hominin evolution and the evolution of the human hand. It also has implications for the evolution of the human hand in the context of the evolution of the genus Homo."

SHMT is up-regulated in cancer, and the mitochondrial isozyme is strongly up-regulated in cancer. Here we show that dual SHMT1/2 knockout blocks HCT-116 colon cancer tumor xenograft formation. We identify small-molecule dual inhibitors of human SHMT1/2, and demonstrate that they are effective cellular target engagers. We also show that formate generally rescues cells from SHMT inhibition, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We show that this effect is rooted in defective glycine import in DLBCL cell lines, rendering them uniquely dependent upon SHMT enzymatic activity to meet glycine demand. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of DLBCL. This work provides a foundation for the development of small-molecule dual inhibitors of SHMT1/2, and for the development of SHMT-based therapeutics for cancer and other diseases.

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. This alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants."
