The structure of ice II is of great importance for understanding the origin of the structure of ice Ih, which is the most abundant form of ice on Earth. In this work, we report the synthesis and structure of neon hydrate, which is the first example of a hydrate with guest atoms in ice II-like positions. The structure of neon hydrate is stable at 480 MPa and 260 K, and the guest atoms have substantial freedom of movement. The results provide a new perspective on the structure of ice II and the origin of ice Ih. This work also provides a new route to study the structure of ice II. The results are expected to be of interest to a broad range of scientists, including ice scientists, geophysicists, and material scientists."

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of the Hv1 channel. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

However, the extent to which species consume the same plant species is largely unknown because of the difficulty of species-level identification of plant remains in the fossil record and traditional methods. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large herbivores in semiarid African savanna. We found that, despite being similar in body size and digestive physiology, these species differed in their proportional grass consumption, dietary overlap, and dietary composition. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages, and that the diversity of large herbivores may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results highlight the need for a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of niche partitioning in large herbivore assemblages. This will be critical for the development of effective conservation strategies for this iconic group of animals."

The development of new antibiotics is a long and costly process, which is often unsuccessful. Here, we present a rational design approach to accelerate the discovery of new antibiotics. We use a computational approach to predict the activity of acylide antibiotics, which are a new class of antibiotics that have been discovered recently. We show that the predicted activity of the compounds is highly correlated with their in vitro activity. We also show that the predicted compounds are active against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. This approach can be used to accelerate the discovery of new antibiotics. (Show more)"

We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data. The proposed architecture is expected to be useful in many other problems in computer vision. The code is available at this https URL."

We present a continuous, first-of-its-kind 1.3-My record of hydroclimate variability from Lake Malawi, East Africa. The record shows a dramatic shift in the effective moisture regime at the MPT, which coincided with the formation of the Lake Malawi basin and the evolution of the cichlid fish. The record also shows that the climate was drier before the MPT, and that the lake level was lower, enabling the evolution of the cichlid fish to occur in a more extensive habitat. The cichlid fish are a unique example of a system that has evolved in response to large-scale changes in the hydroclimate.

One of the most common modifications in coding regions is the pseudouridine (Ψ) modification, which is present in 10–20% of mRNAs. Here, we show that the presence of Ψ in mRNA can impact protein synthesis. We find that the presence of Ψ can modestly alter both translation speed and mRNA decoding. These findings suggest that the presence of Ψ in coding regions can have a significant impact on the translation of mRNAs in cells. This is an important finding for understanding the function of many noncoding RNAs and the translation of mRNAs in cells. (Show more)"

Here we demonstrate that the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa detects contact with surfaces on short timescales using the mechanical activity of its type IV pili, a major surface adhesin. This mechanism requires attachment of type IV pili to a solid surface, followed by pilus retraction and signal transduction through the Chp chemosensory system, a chemotaxis-like sensory system that regulates cAMP production and transcription of hundreds of genes, including key virulence factors. Like other chemotaxis pathways, pili-mediated surface sensing results in a transient response amplified by a positive feedback that increases type IV pili activity, thereby promoting long-term surface attachment that can stimulate additional virulence and biofilm-inducing pathways. The methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein-like chemosensor PilJ directly interacts with the major pilin subunit PilA. These findings demonstrate that P. aeruginosa not only uses type IV pili for surface-specific twitching motility, but also as a sensor regulating surface-induced gene expression and pathogenicity. This mechanism may be important for the successful colonization of the human respiratory tract by this pathogen.

Here we present the results of a comprehensive survey of the chicken in the Southern Levant, which shows that the earliest evidence for economic exploitation of chickens in Europe dates to the first century B.C.E. and therefore is predated by the finds in the Southern Levant by at least a century. This suggests that the gradual acclimatization of chickens in the Southern Levant and its gradual integration into the local economy, the latter fully accomplished in the Hellenistic period, was a crucial step in the adoption of this species in European husbandry some 100 y later.

The activation gate of K+ channels is a critical element for channel opening and the inactivation gate for channel closing. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic activation gate and normally shows no C-type inactivation. We found that BK channels can show slow C-type inactivation and that the rates of C-type inactivation and recovery are inversely correlated with the extent of C-type inactivation. We propose that BK channel C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. These findings may help to understand the BK channel’s unique properties and may provide a new perspective on the regulation of K+ channels. (Show more)"

This change in the RBC’s biophysical properties is required for invasion and is likely to be a critical energy barrier to overcome.

Here, we show that housing mice in low humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

These results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

The distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population.

We found that pol II stalling at O2-EtdT and N3-EtdT sites is exacerbated by TFIIS-stimulated proofreading activity. We also identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop). The Pro-Gate loop faces toward the minor groove of RNA:DNA hybrid and is involved in modulating the translocation of minor-groove alkylated DNA template after nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas the more rigid uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into"

Our results also suggest that the physical appearance of neighborhoods may be a useful indicator of the economic and social health of cities. This work is a step toward a more complete understanding of the physical dynamics of cities."

The mechanisms of these complications are not fully understood, but the dynamics of the virus within the host may be important. Here we present a mathematical model of the within-host dynamics of ZIKV in a nonhuman primate model. We find that the virus grows rapidly within the host, and that the time to detectable virus in the blood is short. We also find that the minimum number of virions produced by an infected cell over its lifetime is ∼5,500. Finally, we show that an antiviral treatment that blocks viral replication can be effective in reducing the time to undetectable plasma viral load. However, the timing of the treatment is important, as treatment given too late is mostly ineffective. (Show more)"

This shift from uptake to release of nutrients by the coral holobiont promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates, leading to the functional breakdown of the symbiosis. Our findings provide a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

Here we propose a computational model of language processing that is based on the activity of single neurons. We show that the activity of a small number of neurons can be used to represent and integrate information about the structure of language. This is achieved through a mechanism that is based on the adaptive changes in the excitability of a small number of neurons. This mechanism is sensitive to context and serial order, and it can be used to bind linguistic features over time. This work provides a step toward a computational neurobiology of language."

Thus, they are dependent on the delivery of biomolecules to the cell for survival. Here, we demonstrate the delivery of biomolecules to plants using DNA nanostructures. We show that the size, shape, compactness, stiffness, and attachment location of the DNA nanostructures are important for the internalization and gene silencing efficiencies. This work establishes the feasibility of delivering biomolecules to plants and also details the design parameters of importance for plant cell internalization and also assesses the impact of DNA nanostructure geometry for gene silencing mechanisms. This work is a significant step toward the development of a new class of plant therapeutics."

However, the role of smaller tributaries in coastal eutrophication has been overlooked. We show that the majority of nutrient inputs to the world’s fifth largest lake, Lake Michigan, are delivered by small tributaries. These inputs are dominated by dissolved inorganic nutrients, which are more bioavailable to algae, and are concentrated in the nearshore zone. Our findings suggest that nutrient management efforts should focus on small tributaries to reduce the ecological impacts of nutrient loading on valuable nearshore ecosystems."

Modeling indicates that the warming event was linked to an increase in nutrient fluxes and thermocline stratification. The warming event was likely a key driver of the extinction."

In species with multiple sex determination loci, the sex of an individual is determined by the genotype at multiple loci. Here we investigate the effects of multiple sex determination loci on the secondary sexual characteristics of a single species, finding that multiple sex determination loci can produce a modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics. This modular variation can be used to understand the evolutionary causes and consequences of the maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations."

In this study, we show that iron, in the form of the chelator deferiprone, can reduce the levels of a toxic metabolite in the retina. This effect was demonstrated in two mouse models, one with a deficiency in the Fe export proteins hephaestin and ceruloplasmin, which leads to accumulation of Fe in the retina, and one with a deficiency in the vitamin A export protein ABCA4, which leads to accumulation of vitamin A aldehyde adducts in the retina. These results suggest that the retina may be a unique organ that can utilize iron to reduce the toxicity of vitamin A aldehyde adducts.

Our findings contribute to understanding the evolution of specialization in predators, and the mechanisms that drive the diversification of food webs."

This study provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key shared derived characteristic of modern human and Neandertal hand morphology and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato.

We also show that the one-carbon unit donor, formate, can rescue cells from SHMT inhibition, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in a cancer cell-line screen. This effect is rooted in defective glycine uptake in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), a cancer with a unique dependence upon SHMT enzymatic activity to meet glycine demand. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of DLBCL. These results provide a rationale for the development of SHMT inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy for DLBCL.
