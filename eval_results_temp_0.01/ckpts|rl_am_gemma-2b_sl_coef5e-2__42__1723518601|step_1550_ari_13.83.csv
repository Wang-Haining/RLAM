However, it is not a theory in the ordinary sense of the word, in that it is not based on a classical foundation. This has led to a number of attempts to provide such a foundation, and to prove that it leads to the same physics as quantum theory. One of the most promising of these attempts is the program of reconstruction, which aims to show that quantum theory is a special case of a more general theory. In this paper, we provide a purely categorical description of the part of this general theory that is relevant to quantum physics. This description does not presuppose any analytical structure, and so it can be used to study the reconstruction program without making any assumptions about the nature of the underlying state space."

Although the evolutionary origin of the myxozoan body plan has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the genomes of two myxozoans and a cnidarian, and show that the myxozoan body plan is remarkably reduced in terms of both genome size and gene content. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. These findings have implications for understanding the evolution of parasitism and the origin of the parasitic lifestyle. (Less)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1, but the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. Here, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammalian herbivores in semiarid African savanna. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers, and dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. These findings have implications for our understanding of the mechanisms that maintain biodiversity and productivity in African savanna. They also have implications for the management of large herbivores in protected areas and agricultural landscapes. View Full-Text"

Here, we report a novel role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse clearance by astrocytes. We also found that APOE alleles affect the rate of accumulation of senescent synapses in the brain, which may contribute to the increased vulnerability of APOE4 to AD-related neurodegeneration. These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes. They also suggest the hypothesis that AD susceptibility of APOE4 may originate in part from defective phagocytic capacity of astrocytes which accelerates the rate of accumulation of senescent synapses, enhancing synaptic vulnerability to classical-complement-cascade mediated neurodegeneration.

This mechanism reduces the required undercooling of iron nucleation, which provides a key factor in solving the inner core nucleation paradox.

The temperature history of the surface is of particular interest because it is inferred to be linked to the origin of life. However, the temperature history of the surface is difficult to determine because of the lack of direct temperature records from the past. Here, we use the thermostability of enzymes to determine the temperature of the ancient surface. Our results suggest that the surface cooled from ∼65–80 °C in the Archean to the present ∼15 °C. This finding is consistent with previous temperature estimates based on isotopic evidence and provides insight into the origin of life on Earth."

They are also the targets of many drugs. The K+ channel, the BK channel, is important for blood pressure regulation and is a target of many drugs. It is also a drug target for the treatment of heart failure. The BK channel has two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. We found that the BK channel’s activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery are spatially related and that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent. We propose that the BK channel’s closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. This finding may help to understand the BK channel’s normal closing and may provide a basis for the development of new drugs and for the treatment of heart failure.

These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. HM was associated with less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia, but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors. The findings highlight the importance of psychological examinations of masculinity as a cultural ideology to understand how men’s and women’s endorsement of HM legitimizes patriarchal dominance and reinforces gender, race, and class-based hierarchies via candidate support.

Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This work provides a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme and its role in the replication of the human genome. This knowledge will be critical for the development of therapeutic agents that target the human replisome."

In the RNA world, the genetic information was stored in RNA molecules, and the replication of this information was accomplished by ribozymes. In this paper, we describe the first laboratory system that can replicate RNA by RNA-based ribozymes. This system can amplify RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins."

We find that neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities."

The origin of Y. pestis is still debated, but the most widely accepted hypothesis is that the bacterium was introduced into Europe via the land and sea trade routes of the ancient Silk Road system. We show that the climate conditions in Asia were favorable for the survival of Y. pestis, and that the bacterium was reintroduced into Europe on multiple occasions. Our results provide evidence for a climate-driven reintroduction of Y. pestis into European harbors, which may have contributed to the spread of the disease. (Less)"

There is an urgent need for novel and more efficient therapies, ideally targeting AML stem cells that are essential for maintaining the disease. Here, we show that monoclonal antibodies targeting the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This study also provides a proof-of-principle for the use of antibody-based therapies in the treatment of other diseases"

However, the settlement history of Madagascar is still debated. We used a grid-based approach to sample the genomic diversity across the island and to investigate the origin of the Malagasy people. We find that the Malagasy people are a mixture of Bantu and Austronesian populations, with a limited contribution from Europe and the Middle East. The settlement history of Madagascar is recent, with a rapid colonization of the island during the last millennium. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the colonization was not homogeneous, suggesting that the settlement of Madagascar from Africa and Asia was not a single event. Finally, we show that a few centuries are sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations.

Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The RNA encodes a 28-amino acid protein that increases the activity of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a key enzyme in the metabolism of glycerol. We found that the protein also interferes with the ability of a small RNA to repress two other genes. The protein and RNA compete for the same translation site, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete. This study provides insight into the regulation of carbon metabolism in bacteria.

In this study, we found that apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), a MAP3K, is a key regulator of neuroinflammation in multiple sclerosis. We also found that ASK1 is expressed in different glial cell types, and ASK1 deficiency in microglia/macrophages, but not in astrocytes, ameliorated neuroinflammation in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Our findings suggest that ASK1 is a promising therapeutic target for reducing neuroinflammation in multiple sclerosis.

We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting.

We show that the proteins that form inclusions in the brain and spinal cord are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, but rather are a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons. This finding may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for ALS. (PsycINFO Database Record"

This glycan is catabolized by the symbiont, which is thus able to maintain a high population level in the organ. This glycan is provided by the host only at night, when the organ is colonized by immune cells that are the main source of the glycan. This study provides a new perspective on the regulation of symbiosis stability, which may be relevant to other animal–microbe associations. It also suggests that the provision of nutrients may be a general mechanism for regulating the activities of microbial communities in the epithelium of animals."

However, in the United States, the economic and ecological costs of wildfire have risen substantially in recent decades. Climate change has likely contributed to some of the increase in wildfire activity, but the direct role of people in increasing wildfire activity has been largely overlooked. We show that humans have vastly expanded the spatial and seasonal “fire niche” in the United States, accounting for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. Actions to raise awareness and increase management in regions prone to human-started wildfires should be a focus of United States policy to reduce fire risk and associated hazards."

We use this method to study the physical dynamics of five US cities over the course of 10 y. We find that neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities."

We show that the time between cell infection and viral production is likely short, the rate of viral production is rapid, and the lifetime of an infected cell while producing virus is ∼5 h. We also show that the treatment of ZIKV infection with a drug that blocks viral replication can reduce the time to undetectable plasma viral load. However, the timing of treatment is critical, and treatment given 2 d postinfection is mostly ineffective in accelerating plasma viral load loss. These results can be used to inform the design of clinical trials for the treatment of ZIKV infection. (Less)"

We asked people to talk with each other and rated the felt connection. We found that the speed at which people responded to each other was a robust predictor of felt connection. Within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Finally, we demonstrate that this signal is used by third-party listeners as a heuristic of how well people are connected: Conversations with faster response times were perceived as more connected than the same conversations with slower response times. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

Our results suggest that Si and JA interact to promote rice resistance against insect herbivores. This study provides insights into the role of Si in plant defense and may lead to the development of Si-based strategies for insect pest management. This article is protected by copyright.

Our findings suggest that small tributaries may be a major source of coastal eutrophication, and that nutrient management efforts should focus on these areas. This study provides a framework for understanding the role of small tributaries in coastal eutrophication and provides a model for how to assess the relative importance of different sources of nutrients to the nearshore zone of large water bodies.

Certification is the main tool used to fulfill these commitments, and the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) is the most common certification scheme. However, the impact of certification on deforestation has not been well studied. We show that certification is associated with reduced deforestation in Indonesia, the leading producer of palm oil. Nevertheless, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results suggest that certification is not a silver bullet for the palm oil industry, but it is an important tool that can be used in combination with other strategies to reduce deforestation."

In this study, we investigate the effects of multiple genes on sex determination in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii. We find that multiple genes interact to produce four possible sexes in this species, and that the modular nature of these four sexes results in variation in a variety of morphological and behavioral traits. These results suggest that multiple genes can produce a variety of outcomes, and that the modular nature of these outcomes can be used to understand the maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations.

We further show that this effect is rooted in defective glycine import in DLBCL cell lines, rendering them uniquely dependent upon SHMT enzymatic activity to meet glycine demand. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of DLBCL. These results provide a rationale for the use of SHMT inhibitors in the treatment of DLBCL.

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the largest dinosaurs, the sauropods"
