It is generally accepted that ice II is formed by the enclathration of a guest molecule in the channels of ice I, but the guest molecule is usually assumed to be a small atom. In this work, we demonstrate that a guest molecule, neon, can be enclathrated in the channels of ice II. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The resolved structure is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. The guest Ne atoms are found to be mainly in planes perpendicular to the channels, but are further constrained by interactions between adjacent Ne atoms. Our results provide a new perspective on the structure of ice II. They also provide a new route to the synthesis of hydrates, which are important in the study of the interaction between water and carbon dioxide. This article is protected by copyright.

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 is able to evade the host immune system and may provide a target for the development of new antiviral strategies. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of the Hv1 channel. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because species-level identification of plant foods is prohibitively difficult with traditional methods. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammal species in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized."

This resistance is mediated by the induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism.

In the cytoplasm, ADF is thought to be involved in the regulation of actin filament dynamics. In this study, we show that ADF is involved in severing actin filaments. We show that the action of ADF is enhanced by mechanical forces. We also show that the action of ADF is enhanced by twisting forces. These results are important for understanding the action of ADF in cells."

In bacteria, they function as precursors to RNA caps, which are required for their biological activity. In this study, we show that the decapping enzyme responsible for removing those caps, inactivated by stress, is also the one that prefers to remove capped RNAs over their capped counterparts. This enzyme, which recognizes capped 5′ ends by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5′ termini, generates a one-nucleotide-long RNA product, which must be further degraded to generate the monophosphorylated 5′ terminus needed to stimulate rapid RNA decay. The unconventional manner in which this enzyme recognizes capped 5′ ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress.

The pore gates of ion channels are the main sites of ion flow regulation. We studied the relationship between the activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery of the K+ channel, the BK channel. We found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is state-dependent and that its rates and extents inversely correlate with channel-open probability. We propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. Our findings provide a new perspective on the regulation of ion flow and the development of new drugs. (Show more)"

This is a major change in our understanding of the invasion process, suggesting that the parasite and host RBC are working together to facilitate invasion. This is an important finding, as it suggests that the invasion process is a dynamic process, with multiple forces working together to facilitate entry. This is a significant advance in our understanding of the invasion process and may lead to the development of new strategies to combat malaria."

Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

This work represents a key milestone toward the development of a synthetic plant-controlled symbiosis in which the bacteria fix nitrogen only when in contact with the desired host plant and are prevented from interaction with nontarget plant species.

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, in the days (Studies 1 and 2) and months (Studies 3 through 6) following the 2016 election, women’s and men’s endorsement of HM predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. In addition, as conceptualized, HM was associated with less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors.

Here, we describe the development of an RNA polymerase ribozyme that can replicate RNA, thus completing the set of necessary activities for the origin of life.

We connect changes in the physical appearance of five US cities with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities."

This subset is dependent on Stat4 and T-bet, but not the IL-12 or IFN-γ receptors, and is required for the development of colitis. These results indicate that Th17 cells are potent mediators of colitis pathogenesis by dual mechanisms: by directly transitioning to Th1-like cells and by supporting the development of classic Th1 cells.

We also show that the ability of Anaplasma to modify the tick microbiota is mediated by the expression of antifreeze glycoprotein (iafgp), which is a protein that is expressed in the gut of the tick. IAFGP binds the terminal d-alanine residue of the peptidoglycan cell wall of bacteria, which results in altered permeability and the capacity of bacteria to form biofilms. These data elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which a human pathogen appropriates an arthropod antibacterial protein to alter the gut microbiota and more effectively colonize the vector.

The method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals, but did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides.

We show that the climate conditions in the Asian and European harbors that were most likely to have been the first introduction sites were favorable for the spread of the disease.

There is an urgent need for novel and more efficient therapies, ideally targeting AML stem cells that are essential for maintaining the disease. Here, we show that monoclonal antibodies targeting the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This study provides a proof of principle that IL1RAP can be targeted with an antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent"

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning.

The disease is caused by the aggregation of mutant proteins, which are also aggregation-prone. Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions in the brain and spinal cord of ALS patients are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. To explain the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in ALS, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. This study provides a new perspective on the pathogenesis of ALS and suggests that the inclusion bodies in this disease are the result of a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons.

The device configuration also enables application of optical tweezers for controlled placement of atoms. Devices can be fabricated reliably from a 200-nm silicon nitride device layer using a lithography-based process, producing predicted optical properties in transmission and reflection measurements.

Virions must first be cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. We show that the first cleavages are significant for MERS-CoV infection, because they are required for virions to use cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, and because the more rigid uncleaved viruses are less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures.

Although the molecular basis of T2D is still unclear, insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction are two main molecular bases yet to be further elucidated. Accumulating evidence indicates that stimulator of interferon genes (STING) plays an important role in regulating insulin sensitivity. However, its function in β-cells remains unknown. Herein, we revealed a distinct role of STING in the regulation of glucose homeostasis through peripheral tissues and β-cells. Specially, although STING deficiency alleviated insulin resistance and glucose intolerance induced by high-fat diet, it surprisingly impaired islet glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Importantly, STING-βKO caused glucose intolerance due to impaired GSIS, indicating that STING is required for normal β-cell function. Islet transcriptome analysis suggested that STING deficiency decreased expression of β-cell function–related genes, contributing to impaired GSIS. These data revealed a function of STING in the regulation of insulin secretion and established pathophysiological significance of fine-tuned STING within β-cells and insulin target tissues for maintaining glucose homeostasis.

The viral genome is segmented into eight fragments, which complicates the packaging process. The packaging of the viral genome is a highly regulated process, and the existence of a selective packaging mechanism is suspected. Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an influenza A virus. This interaction is required for optimal viral replication and favors the copackaging of the interacting viral RNA segments. Our results indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions. The lack of conservation of these interactions might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)."

We connect changes in the physical appearance of five US cities with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology.

FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa.
