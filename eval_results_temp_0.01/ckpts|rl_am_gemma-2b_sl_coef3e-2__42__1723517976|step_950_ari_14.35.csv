Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we present the first comparative analysis of the transcriptome and genome of two distantly related myxozoan species, Kudoa iwatai and Myxobolus cerebralis, and compare these to the transcriptome and genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. These results provide insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Show more)"

In this study, we describe a mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, is able to block nuclear import of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are critical for induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We show that the viral accessory protein Orf6 is responsible for this anti-IFN activity. We also show that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and interacts with Nup98-Rae1, a protein complex that is critical for nuclear import. Our data reveal a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the host immune response and may provide a target for the development of new antiviral strategies.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. Sperm cells are quiescent in the male reproductive system due to Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1 channels, but become active once introduced into the low-Zn2+-concentration environment of the female reproductive tract. How Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

We find that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields will increase to values much larger than present-day values, and the probability of simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year will increase to 86% in the top four maize-exporting countries under 4 °C of global warming. These results highlight the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance. They also portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is largely unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa from diet samples. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species of large herbivores in semiarid African savanna. We found that, despite being similar in body size and proportional grass consumption, species differed in diet composition, and that dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This may have important implications for the conservation of African savanna biodiversity."

The greatest increase we observe in reproductive power is in species that practice allonursing.

A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals.

However, the mechanisms of action of LCCBs are not fully understood. Here, we show that LCCBs activate the STIM/ORAI Ca2+ sensor complex, which is involved in the regulation of vascular remodeling. Our findings provide a rationale for the use of LCCBs in the treatment of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. This study also suggests that LCCBs may be used with caution in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated.

The development of new antibiotics is a major challenge for the scientific community. In this work, we present a rational design strategy for the development of new acylide antibiotics. The strategy is based on the use of computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. The best candidate was tested in vitro and in vivo, and it was found to be 56 times more active than telithromycin, a clinically used acylide antibiotic. The best candidate is synthetically more accessible, exhibits higher solubility and binding affinity to the ribosome, and is up to 56 times more active against resistant pathogens than telithromycin. Notably, the best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. The strategy presented in this work can be used for the rational design of new antibiotics in general. It can be used to develop new acylide antibiotics, which are a promising class of antibiotics"

Our analyses resolved previously controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, plant cell wall-degrading enzymes obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, both major independent origins of specialized herbivory in beetles coincide with the first appearances of an arsenal of genes encoding these enzymes.

These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes. They also suggest the hypothesis that APOE4 may originate in part from defective phagocytic capacity of astrocytes which accelerates the rate of accumulation of C1q-coated senescent synapses, enhancing synaptic vulnerability to classical-complement-cascade mediated neurodegeneration.

However, the evolution of brain neuronal density is still poorly understood. Here, we present a comprehensive dataset of neuron numbers in amniotes, which is the first of its kind. We show that reptiles have not only small brains relative to body size but also low neuronal densities, resulting in average neuron numbers over 20 times lower than those in birds and mammals of similar body size. This has important implications for studies using relative brain size as a proxy when looking for evolutionary drivers of animal cognition. Our results also suggest that the evolution of brain neuronal density may be a key factor in the rise of complex cognition."

However, the role of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal cells is not well understood. Here we show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor.

ADF/cofilin is responsible for the disassembly of actin filaments, and it does so by severing them. However, the mechanism by which it does so is not fully understood. Here, we show that ADF/cofilin is able to induce a mechanical torque on filament segments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist. This torque dramatically enhances severing, and we propose that it is critical to boost ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. Our findings have important implications for our understanding of ADF/cofilin’s role in cell biology.

Here, we show that, in Escherichia coli cells experiencing such stress, the pyrophosphohydrolase RppH assumes a leading role in decapping those transcripts, preferring them as substrates over their triphosphorylated and diphosphorylated counterparts. This enzyme recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5′ termini, resulting in a one-nucleotide shift in substrate specificity. The unconventional manner in which RppH recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress.

The mode of action of the peptide was studied by time-lapse microscopy, and it was shown that the peptide is able to penetrate the fungal cell wall and membrane, and to induce cell death. The results of this study provide a basis for the development of this class of peptides as a spray-on fungistat/fungicide. This is the first report of the antifungal activity of a plant-derived peptide."

In this study, we provide a comprehensive characterization of the posttesticular life history of the Drosophila sperm proteome and determine the extent of molecular continuity between male and female reproductive tracts. We show that the sperm proteome undergoes substantial compositional changes after being transferred to the female reproductive tract. Multiple seminal fluid proteins initially associate with sperm, but most become undetectable after sperm are stored. Female-derived proteins also begin to associate with sperm immediately after mating, and they comprise nearly 20% of the postmating sperm proteome following 4 d of storage in the female reproductive tract. Female-derived proteins that associate with sperm are enriched for processes associated with energy metabolism, suggesting that female contributions support sperm viability during the prolonged period between copulation and fertilization. Our research provides a comprehensive characterization of sperm proteome dynamics and expands our understanding of the critical process of sperm–FRT interactions. (Show more)"

However, it is difficult to be well represented in current climate models. This is due to the complexity of ACI processes, such as the influence of aerosols on water cloud droplet formation. To overcome this conundrum, we introduce the dual-field-of-view (FOV) high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) for simultaneously profiling aerosol and water cloud properties, especially water cloud microphysical properties. This instrument, verified by the Monte Carlo simulation and coincident observations of other techniques, was used to conduct continuous observations of aerosols and clouds over Beijing, China, to investigate the interactions between aerosol loading and water cloud microphysical properties. This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations obtained from the dual-FOV HSRL constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI process. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI."

They open and close their pore gates to control ion flow. K+ channels commonly possess two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also found that the BK channel C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. These findings provide a new perspective on the regulation of K+ channels and may help to understand the mechanism of K+ channel diseases. (Show more)"

However, we show that the parasite also alters the biophysical properties of the host cell, reducing the energy barrier to invasion. This is a major change in our understanding of the invasion process and suggests that the parasite and host cell are working together to facilitate invasion.

In the temperate regions, seasonal influenza outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in ambient humidity. While low ambient humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

We found that the top 12 ranked wildlife viruses are known zoonotic pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. We capitalized on the recent wealth of virus discovery data to systematically identify and prioritize targets for investigation. The publicly accessible SpillOver platform can be used by policy makers and health scientists to inform research and public health interventions for prevention and rapid control of disease outbreaks.

The color of nectar is a key trait that attracts pollinators, but the mechanisms that underlie this trait are poorly understood. Here, we show that the red color of the nectar of Nesocodon mauritianus is derived from a previously undescribed alkaloid, nesocodin. We identify three enzymes that are necessary or sufficient for the production of this pigment, and we demonstrate that the same mechanism is used by two distantly related species that are visited by different pollinators. This work provides evidence for convergent evolution of a key trait in two vertebrate-pollinated species, suggesting that the red pigment is selectively favored and that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation. This work also provides a molecular basis for the red color of nectar."

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how HKU4 and HKU5 transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4.

The improved polymerase ribozyme can synthesize a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and, in low yield, even tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR.

Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology.

Our study provides a new perspective on the role of RORα in IBD, which could be beneficial to the treatment of IBD. (Show more)"

Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action.

We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR).

The drought began in 2012 and has led to acute water shortages, groundwater overdraft, critically low streamflow, and enhanced wildfire risk. We find that precipitation deficits that occurred when conditions were warm were more than twice as likely to yield drought years. We also find that although there has not been a substantial change in the probability of either negative or moderately negative precipitation anomalies in recent decades, the occurrence of drought years has been greater in the past two decades than in the preceding century. We conclude that anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of co-occurring warm–dry conditions like those that have created the acute human and ecosystem impacts associated with the “exceptional” 2012–2014 drought in California. Our results have important implications for water resources management and climate change adaptation in California and elsewhere."

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the converging functions of autism-risk genes and may facilitate the identification of the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms.

Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions in ALS are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. To explain the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in the brain and spinal cord, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

Our findings suggest that vote-by-mail is a policy that can be implemented with minimal costs and may be a valuable tool for safeguarding the electoral process in the future."

We also show that, in cultured astrocytes, hypoxia triggers cortical release of CRF, which acts on CRFR1 to trigger signaling of cAMP/PKA in astrocytes, leading to activation of AQP4 and cerebral edema. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms of cerebral edema and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies. (Show more)"

This challenge becomes more important in the era of big data and complex statistical modeling. The cherry tree (dataset) can be very large and the tools for cherry picking (statistical learning methods) are now very sophisticated.

However, the minimum number of transcription factors that directly induce EC development remains undefined. Here, we demonstrate that ets variant 2 (ETV2) alone can directly convert primary human adult skin fibroblasts into functional vascular endothelial cells (ETVECs). In coordination with endogenous FOXC2 in fibroblasts, transduced ETV2 elicits expression of multiple key endothelial development factors, including FLI1, ERG, and TAL1, and induces expression of endothelial functional molecules, including EGFL7 and von Willebrand factor. Consequently, ETVECs exhibits EC characteristics in vitro and forms mature functional vasculature in Matrigel plugs transplanted in NOD SCID mice. Our study indicates that the creation of ETVECs provides further understanding of human EC development induced by ETV2. This approach may be useful for the treatment of vascular disorders.

However, its function in β-cell is still unknown. Herein, we found that STING is decreased in islets of db/db mice and patients with T2D, suggesting a possible role of STING in β-cell dysfunction. Indeed, STING-βKO caused glucose intolerance due to impaired GSIS, indicating that STING is required for normal β-cell function. Islet transcriptome analysis showed that STING deficiency decreased expression of β-cell function–related genes, including Glut2, Kcnj11, and Abcc8, contributing to impaired GSIS. Mechanistically, the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) and cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&amp;Tag) analyses suggested that Pax6 was the transcription factor that might be associated with defective GSIS in STING-βKO mice. Together, these data revealed a function of STING in the regulation of insulin secretion and established pathophysiological significance of fine-tuned STING within β-cells and insulin target tissues for maintaining glucose homeostasis.

Their genome is segmented into eight fragments, which offers evolutionary advantages but complicates genomic packaging. The existence of a selective packaging mechanism, in which one copy of each viral RNA is specifically packaged into each virion, is suspected, but its molecular details remain unknown. Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus using in vitro experiments. Using silent trans-complementary mutants, we then demonstrated that this interaction takes place in infected cells and is required for optimal viral replication. Disruption of this interaction did not affect the HA titer of the mutant viruses, suggesting that the same amount of viral particles was produced. However, it nonspecifically decreased the amount of viral RNA in the viral particles, resulting in an eightfold increase in empty viral particles. Our experiments indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions. The lack of conservation of these interactions might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses. (Show more)"

Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology.

The loss of the symbiosis is a major stressor for corals, as the zooxanthellae provide corals with nutrients and protection from pathogens. We show that the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis is driven by altered nutrient cycling during heat stress. This shift from uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates, leading to the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis.

This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function.

However, the evolution of predator specialization has been considered an evolutionary “dead end” due to the constraints associated with the evolution of morphological and functional optimizations throughout the organism. Here we show that the evolution of predatory specialization in siphonophores, a group of pelagic cnidarians, is not a dead end, but rather a process that has led to the evolution of specialization on different prey types. Our findings contribute to understanding how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs. They also help build a broader perspective on predatory niche diversification via morphological innovation and evolution."

The fossil record of the human hand is fragmentary, however, and there is a gap in the fossil record between 800,000 and 1.8 My old. This gap is well documented for the emergence and subsequent proliferation of Acheulian technology, which is associated with the evolution of modern human-like hand morphology and function. Here we show that the third metacarpal styloid process, a key derived feature of the modern human hand, was present ∼1.42 Mya in an East African hominin from Kaitio, West Turkana, Kenya. This fossil thus provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key shared derived characteristic of modern human and Neandertal hand morphology and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato. This study provides a link in the fossil record between the evolution of the modern human hand and the emergence of modern human behavior."

We have developed a series of small-molecule inhibitors of the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), which converts serine into glycine and a tetrahydrofolate-bound one-carbon unit. We show that these inhibitors are effective in vitro and in vivo, and that they are particularly effective in B-cell cancers. We also show that one-carbon unit deficiency is a targetable metabolic deficiency of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Thus, this work provides a metabolic rationale for targeting SHMT in cancer, and a metabolic target for the treatment of one of the most aggressive cancers. This work also provides a proof-of-concept for the use of one-carbon unit inhibitors as a class of cancer therapeutics."

In this study, we show that deforestation over a 5-y period (2008–2013) led to a reduction in household fruit and vegetable consumption and thus vitamin A adequacy of diets. Conversely, we found that forest fragmentation over the survey period led to an increase in consumption of these foods and dietary vitamin A adequacy. This study finds a causal link between deforestation and people’s dietary quality, and the results have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals."

The use of farm machinery has greatly increased the capacity of agricultural production, but it has also increased the weight of vehicles, which has led to the propagation of subsoil compaction into deeper soil layers. We show that the increase in vehicle weight has led to a chronic risk of subsoil compaction over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity. Our results suggest that prehistoric roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. (Less)"
