In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2 in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes. We found that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 is able to antagonize the host antiviral response. Our findings may help to design new strategies to combat the ongoing pandemic.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of proton channels, but the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on proton channels: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of proton channels, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of proton channels.

We use global datasets of maize production and climate variability combined with future temperature projections to quantify how yield variability will change in the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. We find that as the global mean temperature increases, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation (CV) of maize yields increases almost everywhere to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation (SD) of yields and a decrease in mean yields. For the top four maize-exporting countries, which account for 87% of global maize exports, the probability that they have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant LMH species (six wild, one domestic) in semiarid African savanna. Our results show that LMH are highly specialized in their food-plant preferences, and that diet composition differs between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results highlight the importance of diet composition in understanding the mechanisms that maintain diversity in LMH. This is particularly important in light of the current global trend toward the expansion of LMH populations into new ecosystems."

We show that the global load of plastic debris on the open ocean surface is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This discrepancy is explained by the selective removal of small plastic fragments by the ocean interior. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean.

It controls vascular contractility, hemostasis, and inflammation and regulates the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products between circulating blood and tissue. To control each function, the endothelium processes endlessly arriving requests from multiple sources using separate clusters of cells specialized to detect specific stimuli. A well-developed but poorly understood communication system operates between cells to integrate multiple lines of information and coordinate endothelial responses. Here, the nature of the communication network has been addressed using single-cell Ca2+ imaging across thousands of endothelial cells in intact blood vessels. Cell activities were cross-correlated and compared to a stochastic model to determine network connections. Highly correlated Ca2+ activities occurred in scattered cell clusters, and network communication links between them exhibited unexpectedly short path lengths. The number of connections between cells (degree distribution) followed a power-law relationship revealing a scale-free network topology. The path length and degree distribution revealed an endothelial network with a “small-world” configuration.

Here we show that anxiety, a personality trait that is associated with a low probability to become dominant, directly influences social dominance in rats. We identify an important mediating role for mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens. High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low-anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as increased reactive oxygen species production in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious animals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious individuals. We conclude that mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens is crucial for social hierarchy establishment and is critically involved in the low social competitiveness associated with high anxiety.

IGF2BP1 is expressed in adult bone marrow and is silenced in fetal liver. In erythroid cells, IGF2BP1 causes a nearly complete reversal of the adult hemoglobin expression pattern toward a more fetal-like phenotype. This is achieved by reduced expression of the alpha-globin gene, increased gamma-globin, and reduced expression of beta-globin. These results suggest a mechanism for chronoregulation of fetal and adult hemoglobin expression in humans. They also suggest a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of sickle cell disease.

Despite advances in treatment, many patients do not respond to therapy, and the majority of patients succumb to the disease.

This resistance is mediated by the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and the fatty acid desaturase SCD1, which are both downstream effectors of mTORC1. In addition, we show that the combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction is effective in preclinical models of cancer. These findings suggest that ferroptosis may be a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer patients with PI3K-mutated or PTEN-defective tumors. (Show more)"

The underlying mechanisms of hypertension are complex and involve multiple signaling pathways. One of the major signaling pathways is the Ca2+ signaling pathway. In this study, we found that the three major classes of L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs) activate the STIM/ORAI Ca2+ signaling pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Our findings indicate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. Our study provides a mechanism of LCCBs action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrates that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. This study may help to improve the safety of LCCBs in clinical practice. (Show more)"

This problem can be addressed by the development of new antibacterial agents to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. Computational approaches are essential tools to this end since their application enables fast and early strategical decisions in the drug development process. Here, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. This work is expected to contribute to the development of new antibiotics. (Show more)"

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal cells is not well understood. We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor.

They are dynamic polymers that can be assembled and disassembled. The disassembly process is regulated by the cofilin family of proteins. However, how cofilin disassembles filaments in a physiological context, where filaments are interconnected and under mechanical stress, remains unclear. Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques, coupled to microfluidics, to study the action of cofilin in different mechanical situations. We find that mechanical stress enhances cofilin binding and weakly enhances severing, but that filament segments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist, experience a mechanical torque upon cofilin binding. We propose that this torque dramatically enhances severing, which is critical to boost cofilin’s ability to disassemble highly connected filament networks in cells. Our work provides a mechanistic explanation for how cells control the disassembly of actin filaments. It also provides a general framework for understanding the action of other molecular motors and proteins in a physiological context. This framework may be useful in the design of new materials and devices."

However, the settlement history of Madagascar is still debated. We used a grid-based approach to sample at high resolution the genomic diversity (including maternal lineages, paternal lineages, and genome-wide data) across 257 villages and 2,704 Malagasy individuals. We find a common Bantu and Austronesian descent for all Malagasy individuals with a limited paternal contribution from Europe and the Middle East. Admixture and demographic growth happened recently, suggesting a rapid settlement of Madagascar during the last millennium. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, there are geographic influences on the present genomic diversity, independent of the admixture, showing that a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. This study provides a comprehensive view of the settlement history of Madagascar. It also highlights the importance of the sex bias in the settlement of Madagascar and the heterogeneity of the settlement process. This study is also relevant to"

We also show that female-derived proteins begin to associate with sperm immediately after mating and that they comprise nearly 20% of the postmating sperm proteome.

This mechanism is important for understanding the pathophysiology of VWD. The force dependence of the switch is consistent with a mechanism in which the switch is triggered by alterations in flow during bleeding. The switch is also important for understanding the effects of mutations in VWF. The effects of mutations are greatly increased by force. This is consistent with the idea that the switch is triggered by alterations in flow during bleeding.

However, the ACI is complex and difficult to be well represented in current climate models. Progress on understanding ACI processes is hampered by inadequate observational capability. Here, we introduce the dual-field-of-view (FOV) high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) for simultaneously profiling aerosol and water cloud properties, especially water cloud microphysical properties. Continuous observations of aerosols and clouds using this instrument, verified by the Monte Carlo simulation and coincident observations of other techniques, were conducted to investigate the interactions between aerosol loading and water cloud microphysical properties. A case study over Beijing highlights the scientific potential of dual-FOV HSRL to become a significant contributor to the ACI investigations. The observed water cloud profiles identify that due to air entrainment its vertical structure is not perfectly adiabatic, as assumed by many current retrieval methods. Our ACI analysis shows increased aerosol loading led to increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius—consistent with expectations—but had no discernible increase on liquid water path. This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus,"

They open and close their pore gates to regulate ion flow. K+ channels commonly possess two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also found that C-type inactivation in BK channels is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. Our findings may help to understand the BK channel’s unique properties and may provide a basis for future drug design."

These changes in the RBC are directly correlated with parasite invasion efficiency. This finding would suggest that the malaria parasite primes the RBC surface through its binding antigens, altering the biophysical nature of the target cell and thus reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion.

While low ambient humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear.

We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

We used expert opinion and scientific evidence to identify host, viral, and environmental risk factors contributing to zoonotic virus spillover and spread in humans. We then developed a risk ranking framework and interactive web tool, SpillOver, that estimates a risk score for wildlife-origin viruses, creating a comparative risk assessment of viruses with uncharacterized zoonotic spillover potential alongside those already known to be zoonotic. Using data from virus discovery projects and public records of virus detections around the world, we ranked the spillover potential of 887 wildlife viruses. Validating the risk assessment, the top 12 were known zoonotic viruses. The SpillOver platform can be used by policy makers and health scientists to inform research and public health interventions for prevention and rapid control of disease outbreaks. SpillOver is a living, interactive database that can be refined over time to continue to improve the quality and public availability of information on viral threats to human health."

One of the main rewards plants offer to pollinators is nectar. One of the most common colors of nectar is red, which is thought to be a visual attractant for pollinators. We show that the red color of Nesocodon mauritianus nectar is derived from a previously undescribed alkaloid called nesocodin. We also identify a second plant that produces red nectar, Jaltomata herrerae, which is visited by hummingbirds. We demonstrate that nesocodin is attractive to the vertebrate pollinator Phelsuma madagascariensis, the gecko, and provide molecular evidence for convergent evolution of this trait. This work suggests that the red pigment is selectively favored and that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation. (Show more)"

In addition, functional variants indicate that they also differed in visible characteristics. This example of female-biased migration indicates that complex demographic processes during the Early Medieval period may have contributed in an unexpected way to shape the modern European genetic landscape."

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. First, whereas MERS-CoV prefers human DPP4 over bat DPP4 as its receptor, HKU4 shows the opposite trend. Second, in the absence of exogenous proteases, both MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes mediate pseudovirus entry into bat cells, whereas only MERS-CoV spike, but not HKU4 spike, mediates pseudovirus entry into human cells.

Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology.

However, the role of RORα in the intestinal epithelium is still unclear. Here, we generated intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific RORα-deficient mice and found that RORα is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis by attenuating nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcriptional activity. RORαΔIEC mice exhibit excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis reveals corecruitment of RORα and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) on NF-κB target promoters and subsequent dismissal of CREB binding protein (CBP) and bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) for transcriptional repression.

However, we find that the D614G mutant spike is more flexible and adopts a range of more open conformations that may facilitate binding to the receptor and the subsequent structural rearrangements required for viral membrane fusion. These results suggest that the D614G mutation may increase the infectivity of the virus. Our results also suggest that the D614G mutation may not be as beneficial as previously thought. (Show more)"

We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This study also provides a proof of principle for the use of antibody-based therapies to target the IL1RAP pathway in AML. This approach may be applicable to other"

We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

Neuroinflammation is associated with the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) ASK1, which is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms of ASK1 in neuroinflammation remain unknown. Here, we generated conditional knockout (CKO) mice that lack ASK1 in microglia/macrophages, astrocytes, microglia, or astrocytes in T cells and dendritic cells. We found that ASK1 in microglia/macrophages plays a major role in the early and later stages of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). ASK1 deficiency in T cells and dendritic cells had no significant effects on EAE severity. Our findings suggest that ASK1 in microglia/macrophages is a promising therapeutic target for reducing neuroinflammation. This study also provides a rationale for the use of a combination of anti-inflammatory drugs and ASK1 inhibitors in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.

The drought began in 2012 and now includes the lowest calendar-year and 12-mo precipitation, the highest annual temperature, and the most extreme drought indicators on record. The extremely warm and dry conditions have led to acute water shortages, groundwater overdraft, critically low streamflow, and enhanced wildfire risk. We find that precipitation deficits in California were more than twice as likely to yield drought years if they occurred when conditions were warm. We find that although there has not been a substantial change in the probability of either negative or moderately negative precipitation anomalies in recent decades, the occurrence of drought years has been greater in the past two decades than in the preceding century. In addition, the probability that precipitation deficits co-occur with warm conditions and the probability that precipitation deficits produce drought have both increased. Climate model experiments with and without anthropogenic forcings reveal that human activities are increasing the probability that dry precipitation years are also warm. We therefore conclude that anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of co-occurring warm–dry conditions like those that have created the acute human and ecosystem impacts associated with the “exceptional” 2012"

We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

Here, we identified and characterized an immunosuppressant protein (MTX) that is highly concentrated in the submandibular salivary gland of the bat, Myotis pilosus. MTX selectively inhibits the epoxide hydrolase function of leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) to inhibit LTA4 hydrolysis and the generation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a potent lipid chemoattractant for host defense against infection.

Here we show that dual SHMT knockout in cancer cells blocks tumor growth in vivo. We also identify small-molecule dual inhibitors of human SHMT1/2, and show that they are effective in cancer cell lines. Finally, we show that defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

We observe that the inclusions contain a number of proteins that are supersaturated even more than the native interaction partners, but not when scores are generated from other human tissues.

Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas the more rigid uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into endosomes"

Vote-by-mail modestly increases overall average turnout rates, in line with previous estimates. All three conclusions support the conventional wisdom of election administration experts and contradict many popular claims in the media. Our results suggest that vote-by-mail is not a panacea for the problems of the US electoral system. Rather, it is a tool that can be used to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the electoral process."

Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus using in vitro experiments. Using silent trans-complementary mutants, we then demonstrated that this interaction takes place in infected cells and is required for optimal viral replication. Disruption of this interaction did not affect the HA titer of the mutant viruses, suggesting that the same amount of viral particles was produced. However, it nonspecifically decreased the amount of viral RNA in the viral particles, resulting in an eightfold increase in empty viral particles. Competition experiments indicated that this interaction favored copackaging of the interacting viral RNA segments. The interaction we identified involves regions not previously designated as packaging signals and is not widely conserved among influenza A virus.

Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology.

It is essential for the maintenance of genetic diversity in populations and is also involved in the repair of DNA damage. In humans, recombination is controlled by a number of different mechanisms, including the positive-regulatory domain zinc finger protein 9. In this study, we describe the distribution of recombination in the genome of a flowering plant, the monkeyflower Mimulus guttatus, and show that it exhibits a similar pattern to that observed in yeast and in mice lacking the positive-regulatory domain zinc finger protein 9. This suggests that recombination initiation described here in Mimulus may reflect ancient and conserved eukaryotic mechanisms."

The identification of these networks is a fundamental step in understanding the brain and its dysfunction in disease. Here, we show that metabolic imaging can be used to identify and validate resting state networks in healthy and disease populations. We also show that the dominant metabolic RSN in healthy subjects is topographically similar to the default mode network. In contrast, in Parkinson’s disease (PD), this RSN is subordinated to an independent disease-related pattern. Network functionality was assessed by quantifying metabolic RSN expression in cerebral blood flow PET scans acquired at rest and during task performance. We found that the dominant RSN was deactivated during rest in healthy subjects and early PD patients, and that this abnormality was partially corrected by dopaminergic therapy. In contrast, in Alzheimer’s disease, significant reductions in network expression were already present at diagnosis, progressing over time. Metabolic imaging can directly provide useful information regarding the resting organization of the brain in health and disease."

However, the role of FSIP1 in the progression and drug sensitivity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. This article is protected by copyright.

However, these factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects of biodiversity loss and environmental warming on ecosystem functioning. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. Our findings have implications for the design of conservation and management strategies to mitigate the impacts of global warming. (Show more)"

Cardiac-specific deletion of STIM1 in mice resulted in depletion of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ stores of SANCs and led to SAN dysfunction, as was evident by a reduction in heart rate, sinus arrest, and an exaggerated autonomic response to cholinergic signaling. These studies reveal that STIM1 is a multifunctional regulator of Ca2+ dynamics in SANCs that links SR Ca2+ store content with electrical events occurring in the plasma membrane, thereby contributing to automaticity of the SAN.

As a result, certified areas held less than 1% of forests remaining within oil palm plantations in 2015. These results suggest that certification may be a useful tool for reducing deforestation, but broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation."

Dysfunction of the exocyst complex is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. The exocyst complex is evolutionarily conserved across kingdoms, and its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. Investigation of the dynamic regulation of the exocyst-related processes using mutants in genetically tractable organisms such as Arabidopsis thaliana is limited by the lethality or the severity of phenotypes. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 (exocyst component of 70 kDa) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study not only provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation but also offers a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

In vertebrates, sex is determined by a single locus, resulting in two sexes. In some species, multiple alleles at a single locus determine sex, allowing for more than two sexes. Here we show that the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii has four possible sex classes, with two sexes (female and male) and two genotypes (ZZXX and ZWXY). We show that this system of sex determination produces modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics, including genital morphology, craniofacial morphology, gastrointestinal morphology, and home tank behaviors. These results provide context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of the maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations. (Show more)"

However, the evolution of predator specialization is often considered a dead end, due to the constraints associated with the evolution of morphological and functional optimizations throughout the organism. Here we show that siphonophores, a group of pelagic predators, can evolve into generalists, and that specialists on one prey type have evolved into specialists on other prey types. These findings help us understand how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs. They also provide a new perspective on the evolution of predator specialization."

The fossil record for the evolution of the hand is fragmentary, however, and the origin of the derived features of the modern human hand is poorly understood. We report the discovery of a hominin hand fossil from East Africa that preserves the third metacarpal styloid process, a key derived feature of the human hand. This fossil provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of this key feature and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo. This finding has implications for the evolution of the human hand and for the origins of modern human-like tool use. (Show more)"

One metabolic change that is often observed in cancer is the up-regulation of the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). SHMT converts serine into glycine and a tetrahydrofolate-bound one-carbon unit. In cancer, the one-carbon unit is used to support cell growth, and thus cancer cells are dependent upon SHMT activity. Here we show that dual SHMT1/2 knockout blocks colon cancer tumor xenograft formation. We also identify small-molecule dual inhibitors of human SHMT1/2, and show that they are effective in cellular models of cancer. Finally, we show that defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. These results provide a foundation for the development of SHMT inhibitors as a cancer therapy. This work also provides a foundation for the development of SHMT inhibitors as a cancer therapy."

This process, which reduces soil porosity and increases soil temperature, is detrimental to soil ecological functioning and can lead to a loss of productivity. We show that the increase in mechanization has led to a widespread risk of subsoil compaction, with the risk of subsoil compaction now affecting 20% of arable land. This alarming trend calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the discovery of a 130-million-year-old footprint of a sauropod in the same formation as the first evidence of subsoil compaction."
