However, the structure of the hydrate formed by the enclathration of neon in ice II has not been determined. Here, we report the structure of neon hydrate at high pressure and temperature. The structure is determined by neutron diffraction and is found to be in excellent agreement with the simulation results. This work provides a new route to study the structure of ice II and the properties of hydrates at high pressure and temperature. It also provides a new route to study the structure of ice II and the properties of hydrates at high pressure and temperature."

In this paper, we provide a purely categorical approach to the foundations of quantum mechanics. The axioms are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. This addresses a question about the mathematical foundations of quantum theory raised in reconstruction programs such as those of von Neumann, Mackey, Jauch, Piron, Abramsky, and Coecke. The approach is based on the notion of a Hilbert category, which is a generalization of a category that generalizes the notion of a Hilbert space. The axioms are formulated in terms of the category of Hilbert categories and the notion of a morphism of Hilbert categories. The axioms are shown to be equivalent to the axioms of quantum mechanics. The approach provides a framework for the study of the foundations of quantum mechanics that is independent of any particular mathematical formalism."

Although the evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we present the first genome assemblies for two species of myxozoans, which are related to the stinging cells of cnidarians. Our results show that myxozoans are a sister group to the cnidarian parasite Polypodium hydriforme and that the myxozoan body plan was reduced to a microscopic parasitic lifestyle accompanied by extreme genome reduction. These results provide insights into the origin of the Myxozoa and the evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic one. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are critical for induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We found that SARS-CoV-2 uses a viral accessory protein, Orf6, to block nuclear import of the cargo-receptor complex. We show that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain. We also show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its ability to block nuclear import of the cargo-receptor complex. These findings provide a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the host immune response and may provide a target for the development of new"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa in the field. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species of large mammals in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of species matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammal assemblages, and that diversity of large mammals may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This may have important implications for the management of African savanna."

However, the global load of plastic debris on the open ocean surface is still unknown. We show that the global load of plastic debris on the open ocean surface is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This discrepancy is explained by the selective removal of small plastic fragments by the ocean interior. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

The development of new antibiotics is a major challenge, and computational approaches are essential tools to this end since their application enables fast and early strategical decisions in the drug development process. Here, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. This work is expected to contribute to the development of new antibiotics. View Full-Text"

Here, we introduce a network architecture that is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data. Our results show that the proposed architecture is a promising alternative to existing architectures for many image-processing problems.

Our results show that the origin of beetles coincides with the origin of the plant kingdom, and that plant cell wall-degrading enzymes obtained via horizontal gene transfer may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of beetles. This study also shows that diversification of beetles was driven by multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivores following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding plant cell wall-degrading enzymes. This study thus provides a new perspective on the origin and diversification of beetles. (Show more)"

APOE isoform is associated with a twofold decreased risk for AD. APOE is also a major protein of astrocytes, a major cell type in the central nervous system that is highly phagocytic. Here, we report a novel role for APOE in regulating the rate of astrocytic phagocytosis of synapses. APOE2 enhances the rate of phagocytosis of synapses by astrocytes, whereas APO4 decreases it. We also found that APOE alleles are associated with different levels of C1q accumulation in the central nervous system. These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes. They also suggest the hypothesis that APOE4 may be associated with defective phagocytic capacity of astrocytes that accelerates the rate of accumulation of senescent synapses, enhancing synaptic vulnerability to classical-complement-cascade mediated neurodegeneration.

Actin filaments are also the main targets of the actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin family of proteins. ADF/cofilin are key regulators of actin filament dynamics, but how they do so is still not fully understood. Here, we show that ADF/cofilin can sever actin filaments in a mechanical context, which is relevant to cells. We find that ADF/cofilin can induce a torque on the filaments, which enhances severing. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for how ADF/cofilin can sever actin filaments in cells. They also provide a new perspective on how actin filaments are severed in other contexts, such as in the formation of stress fibers. Our results have important implications for our understanding of cell migration and for the development of new strategies for cancer therapy."

The settlement history of Madagascar is also unique, with a recent arrival of Malagasy people, and a sex-biased and geographically heterogeneous settlement. These results show that a few centuries are enough to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations.

The temperature of the surface of the Earth is important for understanding the origin and evolution of life. The temperature of the Earth’s surface has been inferred from isotopic data, but this has been subject to question due to uncertainties regarding the isotopic record. We here present a method for determining the temperature of the Earth’s surface based on the thermostability of ancestral enzymes. Our results suggest that the temperature of the Earth’s surface decreased over geological time from ∼65–80 °C in the Archean, a finding consistent both with previous isotope-based and protein reconstruction-based interpretations. Interdisciplinary studies such as those reported here integrating genomic, geologic, and paleontologic data hold promise for providing new insight into the coevolution of life and environment over Earth history.

We found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its rates and extents inversely correlate with channel-open probability. We propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. This study provides a new perspective on the regulation of ion channels.

In temperate regions, seasonal influenza outbreaks correlate with decreases in ambient humidity. While low humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes them more susceptible to severe disease following influenza challenge. We find that low humidity impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in mice deficient in caspase-1/11, an enzyme involved in host defense against influenza infection. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms of dry air-induced influenza disease severity. They also suggest that dry air may be a modifiable risk factor for influenza disease severity.

The analysis of the genomes indicates that women had a much more complex history of migrations than men, and that some individuals had genetic ancestry from southeastern Europe.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how HKU4 and HKU5 transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions. Our findings provide insights into the origin and evolution of MERS-CoV and may help in the development of strategies to combat future bat coronavirus threats to human health. This"

One of the most important enzymes in this process is DNA polymerase δ (pol δ), which is responsible for replicating the lagging strand template. The stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. We designed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. Our results indicate that pol δ maintains a loose association with the PCNA sliding clamp while replicating DNA and that this association is lost on stalling at a DNA lesion. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This study provides a unique insight into the molecular basis of lagging strand synthesis in humans. It also provides a unique model system for studying the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme.

We estimate life expectancy at birth and at age 65 y for 2020, for the total US population and by race and ethnicity, using four scenarios of deaths—one in which the COVID-19 pandemic had not occurred and three including COVID-19 mortality projections produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Our medium estimate indicates a reduction in US life expectancy at birth of 1.13 y to 77.48 y, lower than any year since 2003. We also project a 0.87-y reduction in life expectancy at age 65 y. These projections imply an increase of nearly 40% in the Black−White life expectancy gap, from 3.6 y to over 5 y, thereby eliminating progress made in reducing this differential since 2006. Latinos, who have consistently experienced lower mortality than Whites, would see their more than 3-y survival advantage reduced to less than 1 y."

This glycan is provided by the squid, and the bacteria are able to metabolize it only at night, when the squid is producing light. This glycan is thus used to regulate the activity of the symbionts.

We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. (Show more)"

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. We found that AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete. These results suggest that the translation and base-pairing functions compete for the same binding sites on the target genes. This is an example of a dual-function RNA that has evolved to"

During the functional reduction process, the elevation of evolutionary rates reaches several new rate equilibria, possibly relating to the modified protein turnover rates in heterotrophic plastids.

We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting.

Mutations in the CRAC channel pore-forming protein ORAI1 or the Ca2+ sensing protein STIM1 result in severe immune dysfunction and nonprogressive myopathy. Here, we identify gain-of-function mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of STIM1 and loss-of-function mutations in ORAI1 that cause Stormorken syndrome, and show that these mutations result in constitutive activation of the CRAC channel in vitro and spontaneous bleeding in zebrafish embryos. These data expand our understanding of the phenotypic spectrum of dysregulated CRAC channel signaling, advance our knowledge of the molecular function of the CRAC channel, and suggest new therapies aiming at attenuating store-operated Ca2+ entry in the treatment of patients with Stormorken syndrome and related pathologic conditions.

Here we show that the spread of aggregates in Drosophila is dependent on the presence of a defined subset of neurons, the “aggregating neurons,” and that the spread of aggregates is non–cell-autonomous. We also show that the release of aggregates from the aggregating neurons requires fusion protein 1, a protein involved in the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane. These results demonstrate that the mechanisms underlying the spread of aggregates in Drosophila are similar to those in mammals and that the release of aggregates from the aggregating neurons is dependent on fusion protein 1. These results provide a model for the spread of aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies. (Show more)"

We also show that formate, a one-carbon donor, can rescue cells from SHMT inhibition, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. This effect is rooted in defective glycine uptake in DLBCL cell lines, rendering them uniquely dependent upon SHMT enzymatic activity to meet glycine demand.

Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions in ALS are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. Rather, we show that the inclusion bodies in ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. This metastable state is likely a consequence of the unique cellular environment of motor neurons, which are highly specialized cells that are exposed to a variety of stresses that are not found in other cell types. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons.

To better understand how sequential proteolysis contributes to MERS-CoV infection, we introduced mutations that blocked the first cleavages of the spike (S) glycoprotein. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses trafficked past cell-surface proteases and into endosomes, whereas precleaved viruses used endosomal fusion-activating proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry. Uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and"

However, the minimum number of transcription factors that directly induce EC development remains undefined. Here, we demonstrate that ets variant 2 (ETV2) alone can directly convert primary human adult skin fibroblasts into functional vascular endothelial cells (ETVECs). In coordination with endogenous FOXC2 in fibroblasts, transduced ETV2 elicits expression of multiple key endothelial development factors, including FLI1, ERG, and TAL1, and induces expression of endothelial functional molecules, including EGFL7 and von Willebrand factor. Consequently, ETVECs exhibits EC characteristics in vitro and forms mature functional vasculature in Matrigel plugs transplanted in NOD SCID mice. Our study indicates that the creation of ETVECs provides further understanding of human EC development induced by ETV2. This approach may be useful for the generation of ECs for therapeutic purposes.

While the symptoms of bleaching have been extensively characterized, the underlying causes remain largely unknown. Here, we show that altered nutrient cycling during heat stress is a primary driver of the functional breakdown of the symbiosis. Heat stress increased the metabolic energy demand of the coral host, which was compensated by the catabolic degradation of amino acids. The resulting shift from net uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont subsequently promoted the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host. Energy limitation and altered symbiotic nutrient cycling are thus key factors in the early heat stress response, directly contributing to the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis. Interpreting the stability of the coral holobiont in light of its metabolic interactions provides a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general."

Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity.

However, these factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects of biodiversity loss and environmental warming on ecosystem functioning. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. This is a critical insight for the design of effective conservation and restoration strategies."

Here, we show that striatonigral fibers originating in striosomes form highly unusual bouquet-like arborizations that target bundles of ventrally extending dopamine-containing dendrites and clusters of their parent nigral cell bodies. These clustered cell bodies in turn project to the striatum as part of the classic nigrostriatal pathway. Thus, these striosome–dendron bouquets likely represent subsystems with the nigro–striato–nigral loop that are affected in human disorders including Parkinson’s disease. Given evidence that striosomes receive input from cortical regions related to the control of mood and motivation and that they link functionally to reinforcement and decision-making, the striosome–dendron bouquets could be critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease. This work provides a unique view of the organization of the dopamine-containing nigral system.

But how do we know when two people are connected? We asked pairs of friends and strangers to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

This suggests that their plumes may become trapped and then overlap in the nearshore zone, increasing the likelihood of coastal eutrophication. Our findings highlight the importance of small tributaries in driving coastal nutrient pollution and provide a framework for targeting nutrient management efforts to reduce the ecological impacts of nutrient pollution on valuable nearshore ecosystems."

This study shows that deforestation can reduce people’s consumption of fruits and vegetables and thus their vitamin A intake. Conversely, forest fragmentation can increase people’s consumption of fruits and vegetables and thus their vitamin A intake. These findings have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. This study also highlights the importance of using causal inference methods to understand the effects of deforestation on people’s diets. This is a novel approach that can be used to understand the effects of deforestation on people’s diets in other settings."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants."
