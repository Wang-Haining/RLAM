However, the standard approach to the foundations of mathematics, based on analysis, does not apply to quantum theory. This paper provides a foundation of quantum theory that is purely categorical and does not presuppose analysis. The foundation is based on a small number of axioms that are purely categorical and do not refer to any analytical structure. The axioms are shown to be sufficient to guarantee that the category of Hilbert spaces and bounded linear operators is equivalent to the category of sets and functions that satisfy a small number of additional axioms. This result addresses a question about the foundations of quantum theory raised in reconstruction programs such as those of von Neumann, Mackey, Jauch, Piron, Abramsky, and Coecke."

The evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, but a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we report the results of a comparative analysis of the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species and a cnidarian species. Our results show that the myxozoan body plan is the result of a dramatic reduction in genome size and gene content. This reduction is accompanied by a loss of key signaling pathways and transcriptional factors, suggesting that the transition from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by a significant reduction in the complexity of the animal. These results provide insight into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Read more)"

In this study, we identified a viral protein that is able to block nuclear import of IFN-stimulated genes. We show that this protein is able to interact with the nuclear pore complex protein Nup98-Rae1, which is involved in the docking of the karyopherin/importin complex. This interaction is required for the viral protein to block nuclear import. Our findings provide a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This mechanism may be used by other viruses to evade IFN signaling. Our findings may also provide a target for the development of new antiviral strategies. This article is protected by copyright.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is largely unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa in the diets of large herbivores. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species (six wild, one domestic) in semiarid African savanna. We found that species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption had the greatest overlap in diet composition. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our findings have implications for understanding the role of large herbivores in the structure and function of African savannas."

This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

The use of a single material phase and heuristically developed structural patterns leads to restricted design space and potential failure to achieve specific target behaviors. Here, through a free-form inverse design approach, multiple hyperelastic materials with distinct properties are optimally synthesized into composite structures to precisely achieve arbitrary and extreme prescribed responses under large deformations. The digitally synthesized structures exhibit organic shapes and motions with irregular distributions of material phases. Within the structures, different materials play distinct roles yet seamlessly collaborate through sophisticated deformation mechanisms to produce the target behaviors, some of which are unachievable by a single material. While complex in geometry and material heterogeneity, the discovered structures are effectively manufactured via multimaterial fabrication with different polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomers with distinct behaviors and their highly nonlinear responses are physically and accurately realized in experiments. To enhance programmability, the synthesized structures are heteroassembled into architectures that exhibit highly complex yet navigable responses. The proposed synthesis, multimaterial fabrication, and heteroassembly strategy can be utilized to design function-oriented and situation-specific mechanical devices for a wide range of applications."

The best candidates are then tested in vitro and in vivo, and the best candidate is found to be active against resistant pathogens. The approach is generalizable to other antibiotic classes and can be used to design new antibiotics for other pathogens. The approach is also applicable to other drug classes.

We observe dramatic shifts in effective moisture, resulting in large-scale changes in one of the world’s largest lakes and most diverse freshwater ecosystems. Results show evidence for 24 lake level drops of more than 200 m during the Late Quaternary, including 15 lowstands when water levels were more than 400 m lower than modern. A dramatic shift is observed at the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT), consistent with far-field climate forcing, which separates vastly different hydroclimate regimes before and after 800,000 years ago. Before 800 ka, lake levels were lower, indicating a climate drier than today, and water levels changed frequently. Following the MPT high-amplitude lake level variations dominate the record.

The island is located ∼400 km from the east coast of Africa, but its genetic and linguistic traits are from both Southeast Asia and Eastern Africa. We used a grid-based approach to sample at high resolution the genomic diversity (including maternal lineages, paternal lineages, and genome-wide data) across 257 villages and 2,704 Malagasy individuals. We find a common Bantu and Austronesian descent for all Malagasy individuals with a limited paternal contribution from Europe and the Middle East. Admixture and demographic growth happened recently, suggesting a rapid settlement of Madagascar during the last millennium. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, there are geographic influences on the present genomic diversity, independent of the admixture, showing that a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. These results provide insights into the human history of Madagascar and the origin of the Malagasy people. They"

Here, we show that, in the presence of disulfide stress, the pyrophosphohydrolase RppH, which is normally inactive, becomes the predominant decapping enzyme, and that it prefers to decape Np4-capped RNAs. This enzyme recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5′ termini, resulting in a one-nucleotide shift in substrate specificity. The unconventional manner in which RppH recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress."

In this study, we found that the K+ channel BK has a unique mode of C-type inactivation, which is closed state-dependent. This finding provides a new perspective for the study of the regulation of K+ channels and may be helpful for the development of drugs for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmia.

In the temperate regions, seasonal outbreaks of influenza correlate with decreases in ambient humidity. While low humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes them more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the impact of low humidity on influenza disease and may inform the development of strategies to mitigate the impact of seasonal influenza outbreaks.

However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, there are geographic influences on the present genomic diversity, independent of the admixture, showing that a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. These results provide insights into the human history of Madagascar and help to understand the origin and the dispersal of the"

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The RNA encodes a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC) and a 164-nucleotide RNA (denoted AzuR). We found that AzuC interacts with the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, GlpD, and increases dehydrogenase activity. We also found that the RNA and RNA-binding protein, AzuR, compete for binding to the carbon utilization genes cadA and galE. The results suggest that the protein and RNA functions compete for the same binding sites. This is an example of a dual-function RNA that has evolved to regulate carbon utilization."

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We found that the three regioisomeric EtdT lesions induce distinct pol II stalling profiles. Intriguingly, pol II stalling at O2-EtdT and N3-EtdT sites is exacerbated by TFIIS-stimulated proofreading activity. Assessment for the impact of the EtdT lesions on individual fidelity checkpoints provided further mechanistic insights, where the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion. For the"

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. We found that the sequential proteolysis of MERS-CoV S proteins is required for infection of human lung-derived cells, but not for infection of other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, MERS-CoV S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence."

The genome of these viruses is segmented into eight fragments, which offers evolutionary advantages but complicates genomic packaging. The existence of a selective packaging mechanism, in which one copy of each viral RNA is specifically packaged into each virion, is suspected, but its molecular details remain unknown. Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus. This interaction takes place in infected cells and is required for optimal viral replication. Disruption of this interaction decreased the amount of viral RNA in the viral particles, resulting in an eightfold increase in empty viral particles. Our experiments indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions. The lack of conservation of these interactions might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses.

However, they are threatened by a variety of human activities and climate change. One of the most severe threats is the breakdown of the symbiotic relationship between corals and their algae, known as coral bleaching. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the early stages of bleaching and identifies the processes that contribute to the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis. Our findings provide a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

However, the role of FSIP1 in the progression and drug sensitivity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. (PsycINFO Database Record"

However, the relative importance of small versus large tributaries is poorly understood. We show that small tributaries of large lakes can be a significant source of nutrients to coastal areas, and that their nutrient loads are often high for their size. This finding suggests that nutrient management efforts should focus on small watersheds, as they may be more likely to fuel algal blooms in nearshore areas. Our findings highlight the importance of small watersheds in driving coastal eutrophication and provide a framework for understanding and managing nutrient loading to large water bodies."

We find that the long-time dynamics of such systems are biased toward states that exhibit a fine-tuned extremization of environmental forcing. This behavior is reminiscent of the way in which the dynamics of a mechanical system can be biased toward states that extremize the energy of the system.

We also show that the same changes in microcircuitry can be tolerated in the absence of NMDAR-Abs, suggesting that the presence of NMDAR-Abs is necessary to induce paroxysmal EEG abnormalities. These findings offer mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology of NMDAR-Ab encephalitis and may help to explain the diverse range of EEG abnormalities observed in patients with NMDAR-Abs. They also suggest that the presence of NMDAR-Abs may be necessary to induce paroxysmal EEG abnormalities, which may have implications for the treatment of patients with NMDAR-Abs. Finally, our findings may also be relevant to other conditions in which changes in cortical microcircuitry can lead to paroxysmal abnormalities."

Here, we present a study of an abrupt warming event that occurred during a glacial period. We show that the event was linked to a global-scale injection of organic matter–derived carbon and anoxia, and that the event was linked to a glacial–interglacial climate state. Our results provide insights into the Earth system response to abrupt warming and can be used to inform our understanding of the current warming."

We show that certification reduced deforestation in Indonesia from 2001 to 2015. However, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation."

The exocyst complex is composed of 10 subunits, and the function of the complex is to provide the force for the release of secretory vesicles from the trans Golgi network. The exocyst complex is conserved in all kingdoms of life, and its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and offers a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (PsycINFO Database Record"

In vertebrates, sex determination is often controlled by a single locus, which can result in two sexes, but can also result in more than two sexes. In this study, we investigate the effects of multiple alleles controlling sex determination in a fish species, and find that multiple alleles can produce a modular system of secondary sexual characteristics, allowing for a variety of phenotypes in each sex. This modularity of secondary sexual characteristics provides context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of the maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations."

They are considered a model system for studying the evolution of specialization, as they have a high number of species that are highly specialized on a single prey type. However, the evolution of specialization in siphonophores has been considered a dead end, as the evolution of morphological and functional optimizations throughout the organism. Our study shows that siphonophore specialization is not a dead end, and that it can evolve into generalism. We also show that the evolution of siphonophore tentacles is linked to the evolution of prey type. These findings contribute to understanding how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs."

This study provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key derived feature of the human hand, the third metacarpal styloid process. This fossil provides the earliest evidence for the evolution of a key derived feature of the human hand, the third metacarpal styloid process, and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato. This study also provides the earliest evidence for the evolution of a derived hand in the hominin species Ardipithecus ramidus.

This finding is important because it shows that the role of natural landscapes in improving people’s diets is not well understood, and that the role of forests in improving diets and nutrition is not being fully recognized. The study also provides evidence that increasing food production via agricultural intensification may not be the only way to improve people’s diets, and that natural landscapes can play an important role in this process. The study has implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction."
