However, the extent to which different species partition food resources is largely unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level plant remains in the field. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species of wild and domestic LMH in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in body size and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This work highlights the importance of diet composition in the study of niche partitioning and biodiversity. (Less)"

First, mass layoffs and closures had already occurred—just a few weeks into the crisis. Second, the risk of closure was negatively associated with the expected length of the crisis. Moreover, businesses had widely varying beliefs about the likely duration of COVID-related disruptions. Third, many small businesses are financially fragile: The median business with more than $10,000 in monthly expenses had only about 2 wk of cash on hand at the time of the survey. Fourth, the majority of businesses planned to seek funding through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. However, many anticipated problems with accessing the program, such as bureaucratic hassles and difficulties establishing eligibility.

This is due to the size-selective sinks of the plastic debris on the open ocean surface, which are not accounted for in the current models. These sinks are likely to be of a global nature, and they may be of a similar magnitude for other types of debris."

This problem can be addressed by the development of new antibacterial agents to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens.

The best candidate is synthetically more accessible, exhibits higher solubility and binding affinity to the ribosome, and is up to 56 times more active against resistant pathogens than telithromycin. Notably, the best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters, and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data.

Here, we introduce a deep learning algorithm that efficiently enhances antibody affinity to achieve broader and more potent neutralizing activity against such variants. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a human antibody P36-5D2, which is effective against SARS-CoV-2 Alpha, Beta, and Gamma but not Delta. We show that our approach can identify CDR changes that alleviate the impact of two Omicron mutations on the epitope. These results highlight the power of our deep learning approach in antibody optimization and its potential application to engineering other protein molecules. Our optimized antibodies can potentially be developed into antibody drug candidates for current and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

The earliest evidence for the domestication of the chicken is from the Near East, and the earliest evidence for the economic use of the chicken is from the Hellenistic period in the Southern Levant. This study shows that the earliest evidence for the economic use of the chicken in Europe is predated by at least a century by the earliest evidence in the Near East."

We show that the biomass of humans is an order of magnitude higher than that of all wild mammals combined, and that the biomass of animals is mainly concentrated in the ocean. Finally, we highlight the historical impact of humanity on the global biomass of prominent taxa, including mammals, fish, and plants.

We used expert opinion and scientific evidence to identify host, viral, and environmental risk factors contributing to zoonotic virus spillover and spread in humans. We then developed a risk ranking framework and interactive web tool, SpillOver, that estimates a risk score for wildlife-origin viruses, creating a comparative risk assessment of viruses with uncharacterized zoonotic spillover potential alongside those already known to be zoonotic. Using data from virus discovery projects and public records of virus detections around the world, we ranked the spillover potential of 887 wildlife viruses. Validating the risk assessment, the top 12 were known zoonotic viruses. The SpillOver platform can be used by policy makers and health scientists to inform research and public health interventions for prevention and rapid control of disease outbreaks. SpillOver is a living, interactive database that can be refined over time to continue to improve the quality and public availability of information on viral threats to human health.

The color of this reward is important for attracting pollinators, but the mechanisms by which plants produce and use pigments to do so are poorly understood. Here, we show that the color of the red nectar of the plant Nesocodon mauritianus is derived from a previously undescribed alkaloid, nesocodin. We also identify the enzymes necessary for the production of this pigment, which are likely to be involved in other types of color production in plants. Our work provides a framework for understanding the evolution of this type of adaptation and the role of alkaloids in it."

We find that the genetic ancestry of men is mostly consistent with modern northern and central Europeans, but that the genetic ancestries of women are very heterogeneous, including signals of genetic ancestry ranging from western Europe to East Asia. In addition, we find that women with artificial skull deformations had a genetic ancestry that was very different from that of the rest of the population. This example of female-biased migration indicates that complex demographic processes during the Early Medieval period may have contributed in an unexpected way to shape the modern European genetic landscape."

We connect changes in the physical appearance of five US cities with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

The disease is associated with the expression of the IL1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) on leukemic stem cells, but not on normal hematopoietic stem cells. We show that monoclonal antibodies targeting IL1RAP have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects, and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. We also show that an antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling can suppress the proliferation of primary human AML cells. These results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This approach has the potential to be used in combination with other therapies, and it may be applicable to other types of cancer. (Show more)"

We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

Here, we show that remdesivir is also effective against the MERS-CoV virus, and that prophylactic and therapeutic treatment with remdesivir can prevent and treat MERS-CoV infection, respectively, in a nonhuman primate model. These data support the use of remdesivir in the context of a clinical trial for the treatment of MERS.

The virus infects humans from animals, and the virus is transmitted between humans. The virus is sensitive to many of the same antiviral agents used to treat other coronaviruses, and it is a major cause of pneumonia in dromedary camels. The virus infects human cells by fusing the virus-containing membrane with the cell membrane, a process that requires the virus spike (S) glycoproteins. We show that the S proteins are cleaved sequentially during virus entry, and that the first cleavages are required for the virus to infect human cells. These findings have implications for the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV, and for the development of antiviral agents. (Less)"

Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change.

The unique nanosized and metastable Mo-based oxide is designed to deliver a large capacity and low potential without triggering decomposition of water. A full cell consisting of Li1.05Mn1.95O4/Li9/7Nb2/7Mo3/7O2 presents high energy density of 107 W ⋅ h ⋅ kg−1 as the maximum value in 21 m LiTFSA aqueous electrolyte, and 73% in capacity retention is achieved after 2,000 cycles. Furthermore, hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study reveals that a protective surface layer is formed at the surface of the negative electrode, by which the high-energy and durable aqueous batteries are realized with Li1.05Mn1.95O4/Li9/7Nb2/7Mo3"

The etiology of the disorder is unknown, but it is considered to be a brain disorder. The composition of the gut microbiota has recently been shown to be altered in psychiatric disorders, which suggests the possibility of a gut-to-brain interaction in the development of alcohol dependence. The aim of the present study was to explore whether changes in gut permeability are linked to gut-microbiota composition and activity in alcohol-dependent subjects. We also investigated whether gut dysfunction is associated with the psychological symptoms of alcohol dependence. Finally, we tested the reversibility of the biological and behavioral parameters after a short-term detoxification program. We found that some, but not all, alcohol-dependent subjects developed gut leakiness, which was associated with higher scores of depression, anxiety, and alcohol craving after 3 wk of abstinence, which may be important psychological factors of relapse. Thus, the gut microbiota seems to be a previously unidentified target in the management of alcohol dependence. View Full-Text"

However, the increase in weight has also led to the propagation of subsoil compaction into deeper soil layers, with risks of ecological and economic losses. We show that the current level of subsoil compaction is unprecedented in the history of agriculture, and that the total weight of modern farm machinery is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth. This suggests that the roaming of sauropods, which is thought to have contributed to the expansion of agriculture, may have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles."
