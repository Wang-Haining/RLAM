However, the structure of hydrate is still controversial. In this work, we report the structure of neon hydrate at high pressure and temperature. The structure of neon hydrate is different from that of conventional hydrate. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. This work provides a new insight into the structure of hydrate and its stability. It also provides a new way to store gases under high pressure and temperature. This work is expected to be of great significance for the development of hydrate technology. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

To investigate the evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic one, we compared the genomes of two distantly related species, Kudoa iwatai and Myxobolus cerebralis, to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results show that the myxozoan genome is one of the smallest reported in animals and that the parasite has lost many genes involved in development and cell–cell communication. These findings suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by a reduction in genome size and gene content. This evolutionary transition may have been facilitated by the loss of redundant functions in the parasite’s small genome. (Show more)"

The virus responsible for this pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been shown to evade the host innate immune response by blocking interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral signaling. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We found that the viral accessory protein ORF6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. Sperm cells are quiescent in the male reproductive system due to Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1 channels, but become active once introduced into the low-Zn2+-concentration environment of the female reproductive tract. How Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide"

Earlier studies suggest that once the optimum growing temperature is exceeded, mean crop yields decline and the variability of yield increases even if interannual climate variability remains unchanged. Here, we use global datasets of maize production and climate variability combined with future temperature projections to quantify how yield variability will change in the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. We find that as the global mean temperature increases, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation (CV) of maize yields increases almost everywhere to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation (SD) of yields and a decrease in mean yields. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. They also underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant African LMH species. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers. Grass consumption inferred from mean sequence relative read abundance ranged from &gt;99% (plains zebra) to &lt;1% (dik-dik). Grass RRA was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of % grass consumption, indicating that RRA conveys reliable quantitative information about consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of size-matched grazers—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.

The formation of SiC grains in the interiors of AGB stars is a promising scenario. However, the origin of the interstellar exposure ages of SiC grains is still unknown. We determined the ages of 40 large SiC grains extracted from the Murchison CM2 meteorite. Our ages range from 3.9 ± 1.6 Ma to ∼3 ± 2 Ga before the start of the Solar System ∼4.6 Ga ago. The grains have interstellar lifetimes of &lt;300 Ma, which is shorter than theoretical estimates for large grains. We conclude that the grains condensed in outflows of AGB stars ∼7 Ga ago.

Our results provide evidence for a long-term interstellar transport of SiC grains. This is important for the understanding of the formation of SiC grains in the interiors of AGB stars.

The effective catch per unit of effort has decreased, showing the increasing pressure of fisheries on ocean resources. The effective CPUE of most countries in 2015 was a fifth of its 1950s value, which was compared with a global decline in abundance. There are signs, however, of stabilization and more effective management in recent years, with a reduction in fleet sizes in developed countries. Based on historical patterns and allowing for the slowing rate of expansion, 1 million more motorized vessels could join the global fleet by midcentury as developing countries continue to transition away from subsistence fisheries. This would challenge sustainable use of fisheries' resources. The global fishing fleet is a major contributor to climate change, and the expansion of the motorized fleet has been driven by the use of fossil fuels. We provide a comprehensive reconstruction of the global fishing fleet and its evolution. This will be useful for understanding the impact of the fishing industry on the environment and for assessing the sustainability of the global fleet. This article is protected by copyright.

Here we report the results of a proof of concept study in a mouse model of MSA, in which we show that the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 is able to mitigate α-syn pathology and to mediate neuroprotection in PLP-SYN mice. VX-765 was well tolerated in a 6 wk-long phase II trial in patients with epilepsy. Our results suggest that VX-765 is a promising candidate to achieve disease modification in synucleinopathies by limiting α-syn accumulation.

The selectivity filter is also the site of all of the channel’s gating mechanisms. We have identified a second Threonine residue within the TTVGYGD signature sequence of K+ channels as a crucial residue for the allosteric communication between the activation gate and the selectivity filter. This allosteric communication is essential for the proper functioning of potassium channels. We have also demonstrated that the selectivity filter can be structurally collapsed by the structural collapse of the channel’s activation gate. This structural collapse is a key step in the allosteric communication between the activation gate and the selectivity filter.

However, the use of a single material phase and heuristically developed structural patterns leads to restricted design space and potential failure to achieve specific target behaviors. Here, we propose a synthesis strategy to discover optimal composite structures that seamlessly collaborate to produce arbitrary and extreme prescribed responses under large deformations. The structures are digitally synthesized with multiple hyperelastic materials with distinct behaviors and seamlessly transition between different materials. Within the structures, different materials play distinct roles yet seamlessly collaborate through sophisticated deformation mechanisms to produce the target behaviors. The synthesized structures are effectively manufactured via multimaterial fabrication and heteroassembly. The proposed strategy can be utilized to design function-oriented and situation-specific mechanical devices for a wide range of applications. This work provides a general approach to design structures with desired behaviors and is expected to inspire the development of new materials and structures for mechanical applications."

The hemoglobin expression pattern in human erythrocytes is developmentally regulated and is influenced by a number of factors. Here we show that the insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) is a key regulator of hemoglobin expression in human erythroid cells. IGF2BP1 is expressed in the fetal liver and is silenced in the adult bone marrow.

This suggests that IGF2BP1 may be a key regulator of hemoglobin expression in humans.

In this study, we found that activating mutation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) function, highly frequent events in human cancer, confers ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells. This resistance requires sustained activation of mTORC1 and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)C1-dependent induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. Furthermore, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a transcriptional target of SREBP1, mediates the ferroptosis-suppressing activity of SREBP1 by producing monounsaturated fatty acids. These findings suggest that targeting the mTORC1-SREBP1 pathway may be a promising strategy for overcoming ferroptosis resistance in cancer. In addition, the combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction shows therapeutic promise in preclinical models. These results provide a rationale for the development of fer"

The treatment of hypertension is the cornerstone of cardiovascular disease prevention. The most widely used drugs for treating hypertension are the L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs). However, the use of LCCBs is associated with the development of heart failure. Here, we show that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. Our findings indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. Our data indicate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. This study provides a mechanism of LCCBs action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrates that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI.

To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best candidate designed by us shows activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice, and automatically adapts to different problems.

Our analyses resolved previously controversial beetle relationships and revealed that plant cell wall-degrading enzymes obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles. Moreover, corresponding (Jurassic) diversification rate increases suggest that these novel genes triggered adaptive radiations that resulted in nearly half of all living beetle species. We propose that beetle diversity resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding plant cell wall-degrading enzymes. This study thus provides a new perspective on the evolution of beetles and their symbionts. (Show more)"

Currently, there are no licensed vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we describe a live attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, COVI-VAC, that is being developed by recoding the viral spike protein with synonymous suboptimal codon pairs (codon-pair deoptimization). This vaccine strain is temperature sensitive in vitro and robustly grows at the permissive temperature. In addition, the furin cleavage site within the spike protein was deleted from the viral genome for added safety of the vaccine strain. The vaccine was shown to be protective in hamsters, and the vaccine strain was shown to be highly attenuated. These results support the potential of COVI-VAC for use in mass vaccination programs.

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal and transformed cells is more complex than previously appreciated. We have shown that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor.

They are dynamic structures that can be assembled and disassembled. The disassembly process is essential for many cellular processes, including cell motility. The disassembly process is also important for the repair of actin filaments that have been damaged by various mechanisms. In this study, we investigate the disassembly process of actin filaments in a physiological context. We find that the actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin family of proteins is a key regulator of the disassembly process. We show that ADF/cofilin can sever actin filaments in a mechanical context that is relevant to cells. We propose that this mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. Our findings provide insights into the disassembly process of actin filaments in cells. They also provide a mechanistic understanding of the role of ADF/cofilin in the repair of damaged actin filaments.

In bacteria, the predominant decapping enzyme, ApaH, is inactivated by the very conditions of disulfide stress that enable Np4-capped RNAs to accumulate to high levels. Here, we show that, in Escherichia coli cells experiencing such stress, the RNA pyrophosphohydrolase RppH assumes a leading role in decapping those transcripts, preferring them as substrates over their triphosphorylated and diphosphorylated counterparts. This enzyme recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5′ termini, resulting in a one-nucleotide shift in substrate specificity. The unconventional manner in which RppH recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress.

SOC systems are characterized by a power-law distribution of the temporal activity. The most famous example is the sandpile model, which is a discrete model of SOC. In this paper, we report on our discovery of a continuous model of SOC. Our model is a certain scaling limit of the sandpile model. We discuss the dichotomy between continuous and discrete models in several contexts. Our aim in this context is to present an idealized tropical toy model, requiring further investigation."

While low humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that mice housed in low humidity are more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus.

Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. The web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to capture the sound-induced air particle movements that approach the maximum physical efficiency better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself. The spider also enables the flexibility to functionally adjust and regularly regenerate its external ""eardrum"" according to its needs.

Globally, fossil-fuel-related emissions account for about 65% of the excess mortality, and 70% of the climate cooling by anthropogenic aerosols. The chemical influence of air pollution on aeolian dust contributes to the aerosol cooling. Since aerosols mask the anthropogenic rise in global temperature, removing fossil-fuel-generated particles liberates 0.51 °C and all pollution particles 0.73 °C warming, reaching around 2 °C over North America and Northeast Asia. The steep temperature increase from removing aerosols can be moderated to about 0.36 °C globally by the simultaneous reduction of tropospheric ozone and methane.

Our results suggest that the pathogen did not diversify significantly during this time, and that it spread rapidly across Eurasia. This study also reveals the presence of the flea-adapted form of plague in Bronze Age Iberia, previously only identified in the Caucasus and the Volga regions, suggesting a much wider geographic spread of this form of plague. Together, these data reveal the dynamic nature of plague’s formative years in terms of its early evolution and ecology. (Show more)"

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, in the days (Studies 1 and 2) and months (Studies 3 through 6) following the 2016 American presidential election, women’s and men’s endorsement of hegemonic masculinity predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. The findings highlight the importance of psychological examinations of masculinity as a cultural ideology to understand how men’s and women’s endorsement of hegemonic masculinity legitimizes patriarchal dominance and reinforces gender, race, and class-based hierarchies via candidate support.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions.

We found that human pol δ maintains a loose association with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. Our results provide a unique insight into the mechanism of lagging strand synthesis in humans. This study also provides a unique model for studying the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme in humans.

ALKBH5 demethylates N6-methyladenosine (m6A) at the NANOG mRNA 3′-UTR, which increases NANOG mRNA levels and the percentage of cells that are CSCs. Thus, ALKBH5 is a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer. This study also provides insight into the role of m6A modification in the tumor microenvironment. (Read more)"

We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals, but did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript. These results suggest that ultrafine vellum does not necessarily derive from the use of abortive or newborn animals with ultrathin hides, but could equally well reflect a production process that allowed the skins of maturing animals of several species to be rendered into vellum of equal quality and fineness. This method could be used to identify the source of parchment in other historical documents. (Show more)"

The age of the extinction is a key parameter for understanding its cause and the controls on extinction/recovery dynamics. We present a precise age model for the extinction based on U-Pb dating of volcanic ash beds. The extinction occurred between 251.941 ± 0.037 and 251.880 ± 0.031 Mya, an interval of 60 ± 48 ka. Onset of a major reorganization of the carbon cycle immediately precedes the initiation of extinction and is punctuated by a sharp (3‰), short-lived negative spike in the isotopic composition of carbonate carbon. Carbon cycle volatility persists for ∼500 ka before a return to near preextinction values. Decamillenial to millennial level resolution of the mass extinction and its aftermath will permit a refined evaluation of the relative roles of rate-dependent processes contributing to the extinction, allowing insight into postextinction ecosystem expansion. This study establishes an accurate time point for evaluating the plausibility of trigger and kill mechanisms. ("

RORαΔIEC mice exhibit excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs.

These projections imply an increase of nearly 40% in the Black−White life expectancy gap, from 3.6 y to over 5 y, thereby eliminating progress made in reducing this differential since 2006.

We also show that this glycan is catabolized by the symbiont, which is required for the maintenance of a normal symbiont population level. Finally, we show that catabolism of this glycan by the symbiont modulates the pH of the symbiont’s habitat, which in turn enhances its capacity to produce bioluminescence at night. This study provides a mechanism by which animals may regulate the activities of their symbionts. It also suggests that the provision of nutrients to symbionts may be a more common phenomenon than previously thought. (Show more)"

The NVDRS summarizes violent death incidents with structured variables and unstructured narratives. Our method identifies 225 latent topics in the narratives, many of which are not captured by existing structured variables. Motivated by known patterns in suicide and homicide, we identify the gender bias of our topics and compare the gender bias of topics to their prevalence in narratives of female versus male victims.

The identification of AML stem cells is of great importance for the development of more efficient therapies. Here we show that monoclonal antibodies targeting the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This study also provides a proof-of-concept for the use of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of other diseases. This article"

We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR).

Our findings suggest that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner. This process is likely to have been accompanied by bursts of gene losses, which are associated with periods of relaxed selection. Our results have implications for the evolution of plastid genomes in general and for the evolution of parasitic lifestyles in particular.

We use a high-resolution climate model to quantify the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the probability of occurrence of the prolonged rainfall deficit. We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 80% by the year 2100 under a high-emission scenario (SSP5-8.5). This highlights the strong sensitivity of the drought risk in SSA to future anthropogenic emissions. Our results emphasize the need for urgent adaptation measures. (Show more)

The drought began in 2012 and has led to acute water shortages, groundwater overdraft, critically low streamflow, and enhanced wildfire risk. We find that precipitation deficits in California were more than twice as likely to yield drought years if they occurred when conditions were warm. We also find that although there has not been a substantial change in the probability of either negative or moderately negative precipitation anomalies in recent decades, the occurrence of drought years has been greater in the past two decades than in the preceding century. In addition, the probability that precipitation deficits co-occur with warm conditions and the probability that precipitation deficits produce drought have both increased. We conclude that anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of co-occurring warm–dry conditions like those that have created the acute human and ecosystem impacts associated with the “exceptional” 2012–2014 drought in California. Our results have important implications for water resources management and climate change adaptation in California and elsewhere.

Therefore, it is difficult to identify the causal genes and the causal pathways. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility in autism and may facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies. This study also provides a model system for studying the role of forgetting in behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record"

Here we use a fluorescently tagged polyglutamine-expanded form of human huntingtin to study the spreading of aggregates in a Drosophila model of Huntington’s disease. We show that aggregates accumulate at synaptic terminals and progressively spread throughout the brain. These aggregates are internalized and accumulate within other neurons. We also show that the release of aggregates requires N-ethylmalemide–sensitive fusion protein 1, demonstrating that active release and uptake of aggregates are important elements of spreading and disease progression.

We observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

We also identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop). The Pro-Gate loop faces toward the minor groove of RNA:DNA hybrid and is involved in modulating the translocation of minor-groove alkylated DNA template after nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion. This work provides important mechanistic insights into transcriptional stalling, lesion bypass, and mutagenesis of alkylated DNA lesions. These findings will help to understand the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional mutagenesis and provide important information for the development of DNA alkylation-resistant drugs.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas the more rigid uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into"

These results provide robust evidence to support the potential for simple changes to catering practices to make an important contribution to achieving more sustainable diets at the population level.

We find that 1) universal vote-by-mail does not appear to affect either party’s share of turnout, 2) universal vote-by-mail does not appear to increase either party’s vote share, and 3) universal vote-by-mail modestly increases overall average turnout rates, in line with previous estimates.

First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

The role of fibrous sheath interacting protein 1 (FSIP1) in TNBC has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 is expressed in the majority of TNBCs and is associated with poor prognosis. FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. This study may also provide a potential therapeutic target for TNBC treatment. (PsycInfo Database Record"

However, these factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning becomes steeper, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function.

In this study, we show that the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) gene is not required for flowering of the host plant in a host–parasite interaction. Instead, FTs are able to move from the host to the parasite, where they physically interact with a dodder FD transcription factor to activate dodder flowering. This study demonstrates that FTs can function as an important interplant flowering signal in host–parasite interactions. The unique means of flowering regulation of dodder illustrates how regressive evolution, commonly found in parasites, may facilitate the physiological synchronization of parasite and host, here allowing the C. australis parasite to time reproduction exactly with that of their hosts, likely optimizing parasite fitness. This study also provides a new perspective on the evolution of flowering in plants. It is likely that flowering is a trait that has been lost several times in different lineages of plants.

The present study shows that the dopamine-producing neurons are connected to other brain regions, including the striatum, via a specialized system of neurons in the substantia nigra. These neurons are densely packed into clusters of cells that are connected to striatonigral fibers. These clusters of cells are reminiscent of the bouquet-like structures found in the brain of other animals.

Our findings suggest that nutrient management efforts should focus on small tributaries to reduce the ecological impacts of nutrient pollution on valuable nearshore ecosystems. Our results have implications for understanding the role of small tributaries in driving coastal eutrophication in other large water bodies around the world."

We find that the long-time dynamics of such systems are biased toward states that exhibit a fine-tuned extremization of the environmental forcing. This behavior is reminiscent of the behavior of a mechanical system that is driven by a small set of external forces. We discuss the implications of our findings for the study of complex systems in general.

Here we show that NMDAR-Abs change the dynamics of cortical microcircuits, which can predispose brain dynamics to paroxysmal abnormalities. We validate a dynamic model of NMDAR-Ab effects on cortical microcircuitry and show that the same changes in microcircuitry can lead to paroxysms in the mouse model of NMDAR-Ab encephalitis. These findings offer mechanistic insights into circuit-level dysfunction induced by NMDAR-Abs. They also suggest that the same changes in microcircuitry could be tolerated in the in silico model of the control condition, but only when the same parameter fluctuations are tolerated in the in vivo model of the control condition. This suggests that the same circuit-level changes could be tolerated in the in vivo condition, but only when the same parameter fluctuations are tolerated in the in silico condition. This could explain the variability in clinical outcomes. These findings also suggest that the same circuit-level changes could be tolerated in the in vivo condition, but only when the same parameter fluctuations are tolerated in the in silico condition.

This transition is expected to be abrupt and potentially catastrophic for life on Earth. However, the history of abrupt climate change in the past is poorly understood. Here, we present a case study of an abrupt climate change event that occurred ∼304 Ma during a glacial period. We show that the event was linked to a global warming and anoxia of the deep ocean. Our results provide insights into the potential for abrupt climate change in the future and the potential for life to survive such a change. This article is protected by copyright.

We show that RSPO certification is associated with reduced deforestation in oil palm plantations. However, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results suggest that certification is not a silver bullet for tropical deforestation, but it is an important tool in the toolbox of policies to reduce tropical deforestation.

In humans, its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. The exocyst complex is evolutionarily conserved, and its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. Investigation of the dynamic regulation of the exocyst-related processes using mutants in genetically tractable organisms such as Arabidopsis thaliana is limited by the lethality or the severity of phenotypes. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 (exocyst component of 70 kDa) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and offers a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

In many species, sex is determined by a single genetic locus. In others, sex is determined by multiple interacting loci, resulting in a spectrum of genotypes that can be phenotypically male, female, or intermediate. Here we investigate the effects of multiple interacting sex determination alleles in a species with polygenic sex determination. We find that the modularity of secondary sexual characteristics produced by polygenic sex determination provides context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations. Our results suggest that the maintenance of sex determination alleles is not a binary process, but rather a dynamic one that can be modulated by the modularity of secondary sexual characteristics. This provides a framework for understanding the evolutionary consequences of sex determination alleles in vertebrates. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

We sought to understand how Fe levels impact the retina, given that retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are also challenged by accumulations of bisretinoids that photogenerate reactive oxygen species and photodecompose into damaging aldehyde- and dicarbonyl-bearing species. In mice treated with the Fe chelator deferiprone (DFP), intracellular Fe levels were reduced. DFP-treated albino Abca4−/− and agouti wild-type mice exhibited elevated bisretinoid levels. Thinning of the outer nuclear layer, a parameter indicative of the loss of photoreceptor cell viability, was also reduced in DFP-treated albino Abca4−/−. In contrast to the effects of the Fe chelator, mice burdened with increased intracellular Fe in RPE due to deficiency in the Fe export proteins hephaestin and ceruloplasmin, presented with reduced bisretinoid levels. These findings indicate that intracellular Fe promotes bisretinoid oxidation and degradation. This interpretation was supported by experiments showing that DFP decreased the"

However, the evolution of specialization is often considered a dead end, due to the constraints associated with the evolution of morphological and functional optimizations throughout the organism. Here we show that siphonophores, a group of pelagic predators, can evolve into generalists, and that specialists on one prey type have evolved into specialists on other prey types. Our findings suggest that shifts between prey types are linked to shifts in the morphology, mode of evolution, and evolutionary correlations of tentilla and their nematocysts. These findings contribute to understanding how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs. They also help build a broader perspective on predatory niche diversification via morphological innovation and evolution. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Despite the discovery of relatively complete hands from two early hominin species (Ardipithecus ramidus and Australopithecus sediba) and partial hands from another (Australopithecus afarensis), fundamental questions remain about the evolution of the human hand. These questions are driven by the paucity of hand fossils in the hominin fossil record between 800,000 and 1.8 My old, a time interval well documented for the emergence and subsequent proliferation of Acheulian technology. We show that the third metacarpal styloid process, a key derived feature of the human hand, was present ∼1.42 Mya in an East African hominin from Kaitio, West Turkana, Kenya. This fossil thus provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key shared derived characteristic of modern human and Neandertal hand morphology and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato."

One of the key metabolic pathways that supports cell growth is the one-carbon unit pathway, which is supported by the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). SHMT is up-regulated in cancer, and is a promising therapeutic target. Here we report the discovery of a series of small-molecule dual inhibitors of SHMT1 and SHMT2. We show that these compounds are effective inhibitors of cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. We also show that formate, a one-carbon donor, can rescue cells from SHMT inhibition. However, formate is uniquely toxic to cells that are defective in glycine import, a process that is critical for SHMT enzymatic activity. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of cancer. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

In this study, we show that deforestation can affect people’s diets and that this effect is likely to be negative. This finding has important implications for policy makers, who have largely overlooked forests in strategies to improve nutrition. Our results suggest that forests can be a source of food and nutrition security, and that they can contribute to meeting the global nutrition goals. This study also highlights the need for more research on the role of natural landscapes in improving people’s diets. This is particularly important in light of the current global food crisis."

We show that subsoil compaction has become a global phenomenon, with potential loss of productivity. We hypothesize that the roaming of sauropods on land, which is now a highly compacted environment, may have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods. Our findings call for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. This may be a critical factor in the success of modern mechanization and the future of agriculture. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
