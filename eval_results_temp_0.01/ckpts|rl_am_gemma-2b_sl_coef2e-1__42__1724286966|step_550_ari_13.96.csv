In this work, we report the first observation of enclathration of neon in ice II. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The resolved structure where Ne dissolved in ice II is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. The density distributions indicate that the vibration of Ne atoms is mainly in planes perpendicular to D2O channels, whereas their distributions along the channels are further constrained by interactions between adjacent Ne atoms.

Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we compare the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. These results provide insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Contains images and supplementary material.)"

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of proton channels, but the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels is not completely understood. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some proton channel residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

This variability will increase the probability of simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year in the top four maize-exporting countries to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large herbivore species in semiarid African savanna. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers. Grass consumption inferred from DNA sequences was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of % grass consumption, indicating that DNA metabarcoding can be used to quantify diet breadth. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages, and that large herbivore diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This study demonstrates the power of DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth and composition in large herbivore assemblages. It also provides a framework for quantifying diet overlap and its implications for coexistence"

However, the global load of floating plastic debris is still unknown. We show that the global load of floating plastic debris is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This discrepancy is explained by the selective removal of small plastic fragments by the ocean interior. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

We found that this resistance is mediated by SREBP1/SCD1-dependent lipogenesis, and that this resistance can be overcome by mTORC1 inhibition. These findings suggest that combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction may be a promising strategy for cancer therapy. In addition, we found that the combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction resulted in near-complete tumor regression in preclinical models for PI3K-mutated breast cancer and PTEN-defective prostate cancer.

The most widely used drugs for treating hypertension are L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs). LCCBs are associated with heart failure in patients. Here, we show that LCCBs activate STIM/ORAI-mediated Ca2+ entry in vascular smooth muscle cells. LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. Our findings unravel a mechanism of LCCBs action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. These findings may help to explain the association of LCCBs with heart failure and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for treating hypertension.

The only available vaccines are based on inactivated virus or viral vectors. In contrast, the only live attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine currently in clinical development is described in this paper. The vaccine is based on a recoded segment of the viral spike protein, which is the viral protein most relevant for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The recoding introduces 283 silent mutations, which are not expected to affect the viral fitness. The recoding also removes the furin cleavage site within the spike protein, which is expected to improve the safety of the vaccine strain. The vaccine is temperature sensitive in vitro, but grows robustly at the permissive temperature. The vaccine generates high levels of spike IgG antibodies and plaque reduction neutralization titers in hamsters. The vaccine protects hamsters from lethal challenge with the wild-type virus, and the level of protection is comparable to that of the wild-type virus. The vaccine is expected to be suitable for mass vaccination programs. This is the first report of a live attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine."

Using Bayesian inference, we found that this model fits mortality curves from nine outbreaks in Europe better than models for rodent or pneumonic transmission. Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346–1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats.

However, current inhibitors cannot distinguish between TRAP1 and HSP90, the target of the clinically approved drug, geldanamycin. We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor.

It is thought to sever filaments by binding to the barbed end and to the neck region. However, the physiological relevance of this mechanism is unclear. Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to monitor and quantify the action of ADF in different mechanical situations. We find that ADF binds to the barbed end and to the neck region, but that filament curvature favors severing. Surprisingly, tension has no effect on ADF binding, but surprisingly, it enhances severing. We propose that the ADF-induced filament torque enhances severing by 100-fold. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. Our findings have important implications for understanding the role of ADF in cell motility and cell division. They also provide a general framework for understanding the action of other mechanochemical enzymes in cells. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Future studies are needed to determine the extent to which the effects of fructose on brain and behavior are specific to fructose or are due to its ability to increase insulin levels.

However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population.

This mechanosensitive signal transduction pathway is required for the sensing of surfaces and the regulation of a wide range of virulence factors.

Here, we show that the RNA pyrophosphohydrolase RppH assumes a leading role in decapping those transcripts, preferring them as substrates over their triphosphorylated and diphosphorylated counterparts. Unexpectedly, this enzyme recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5′ termini, resulting in a one-nucleotide shift in substrate specificity. The unconventional manner in which RppH recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress.

The HSRL is capable of measuring aerosol and cloud properties with high spatial and temporal resolution. We use the HSRL to conduct a case study over Beijing, China, to investigate the interactions between aerosol loading and water cloud microphysical properties.

The K+ channel KCNB1 has two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. We found that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. C-type inactivation in most K+ channels occurs upon sustained membrane depolarization or channel opening and then recovers during hyperpolarized membrane potentials or channel closure. However, we found that the BK channel C-type inactivation occurred during hyperpolarized membrane potentials or with decreased intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) and recovered with depolarized membrane potentials or elevated [Ca2+]i. This finding suggests that C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter. We propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. These findings may help to understand the physiological roles of K+ channel C-type inactivation. (Simplified version available.)"

In the temperate regions, seasonal influenza outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in ambient humidity. While low humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes them more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, in the days (Studies 1 and 2) and months (Studies 3 through 6) following the 2016 election, women’s and men’s endorsement of hegemonic masculinity predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. In addition, as conceptualized, hegemonic masculinity predicted less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors. The findings highlight the importance of psychological examinations of masculinity as a cultural ideology to understand how men’s and women’s endorsement of hegemonic masculinity legitimizes patriarchal dominance and reinforces gender, race, and class-based hierarchies via candidate support.

Pol δ is responsible for replicating the lagging strand template and anchors to the PCNA sliding clamp to form a holoenzyme. The stability of this complex is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. Most of our understanding comes from Saccharomyces cerevisae where the extreme stability of the pol δ holoenzyme ensures that every nucleobase within an Okazaki fragment is faithfully duplicated before dissociation but also necessitates an active displacement mechanism for polymerase recycling and exchange. However, the human pol δ holoenzyme is remarkably stable. We designed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. Surprisingly, the results indicate that human pol δ maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This behavior is unique to human DNA polymerases and may be a key to understanding the evolution of the human genome. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are responsible for tumor initiation and relapse. We report that hypoxia induces expression of AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), which demethylates m6A in NANOG mRNA, which encodes a breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) marker. ALKBH5 expression is increased in BCSCs and hypoxia induces ALKBH5 expression in a HIF-dependent manner. ALKBH5 overexpression increases the percentage of BCSCs and decreases the number of BCSCs in a NANOG-dependent manner. Thus, ALKBH5 expression in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment promotes BCSC expansion. These findings provide a mechanism for the role of ALKBH5 in breast cancer progression. They also suggest that ALKBH5 may be a therapeutic target for breast cancer treatment. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that ALKBH5 expression is decreased in breast cancer patients with breast cancer. Thus, ALKBH5 may be a useful biomarker for breast cancer prognosis and treatment."

The source of the parchment, often called “uterine vellum,” has been a long-standing controversy in codicology. This study uses a simple and objective method to identify the animal origin of parchment. The noninvasive method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals; however, we did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides. These results suggest that ultrafine vellum does not necessarily derive from the use of abortive or newborn animals with ultrathin hides, but could equally well reflect a production process that allowed the skins of maturing animals of several species to be rendered into vellum of equal quality and fineness. This method could be used to identify the animal origin of parchment from"

RORαΔIEC mice exhibit excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis reveals corecruitment of RORα and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) on NF-κB target promoters and subsequent dismissal of CREB binding protein (CBP) and bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) for transcriptional repression.

Furthermore, we discover that pressure-induced s-d orbital transfer makes Ni, Pd, and Pt “pseudo–noble-gas” atoms with a closed d-shell configuration, and the elements preceding them (Fe and, especially, Co, Rh, and Ir) electron acceptors, while the elements right after them (Cu, Ag, Zn, and Cd) become highly electropositive.

We use a generative model to identify a set of latent topics that can be interpreted as discourse atoms. Each atom is a distribution over words. We can infer the topic that generated a sequence of words. We illustrate our method with a prominent example of underutilized text: the US National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). We identify 225 latent topics in the narratives. Many of these topics are not captured by existing structured variables. We then compare the gender bias of topics to their prevalence in narratives of female versus male victims. Results provide a detailed quantitative picture of reporting about lethal violence and its gendered nature. Our method offers a flexible and broadly applicable approach to model topics in text data. It can be applied to many domains and is particularly useful for identifying latent patterns in text data that are not captured by existing structured variables. It can also be used to identify the gender bias of topics. Our method can be extended to other domains and other types of text data.

We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action.

Our analysis reveals no significant differences in the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration between control and warmed plots in all biomes, with the exception of deserts and boreal forests. Thus, our data provide limited evidence of acclimation of soil respiration to experimental warming in several major biome types, contrary to the results from multiple single-site studies. Our analysis adds a unique cross-biome perspective on the temperature response of soil respiration, information critical to improving our mechanistic understanding of how soil carbon dynamics change with climatic warming.

The molecular signature of the transition from autotrophy to a parasitic lifestyle is not well understood. We present a model of the molecular evolution of plastid genomes under progressively relaxed functional constraints during the transition from autotrophy to a parasitic lifestyle. We show that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner. During the functional reduction process, the elevation of evolutionary rates reaches several new rate equilibria, possibly relating to the modified protein turnover rates in heterotrophic plastids. Our findings suggest that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner. This model can be used to infer the evolutionary history of the transition to obligate parasitism in the parasitic plastid lineages.

We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

However, the factors that contribute to virus spillover from bats are largely unknown. Here, we identified and characterized a protein that is highly concentrated in the submandibular salivary gland of the bat, Myotis pilosus. This protein, named MTX, selectively inhibits the epoxide hydrolase function of leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) to inhibit LTA4 hydrolysis and the generation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a potent lipid chemoattractant for host defense against infection. MTX potently inhibited proinflammatory proteases to induce immune tolerance and maintain high stability.

To explain the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in the brain and spinal cord, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

Now, based upon the study of more than 1,000 carefully prepared specimens, a detailed analysis of Montsechia is presented. The morphology and anatomy of the plant, including aspects of its reproduction, suggest that Montsechia is sister to Ceratophyllum (whenever cladistic analyses are made with or without a backbone). Montsechia was an aquatic angiosperm living and reproducing below the surface of the water, similar to Ceratophyllum. Montsechia is Barremian in age, raising questions about the very early divergence of the Ceratophyllum clade compared with its position as sister to eudicots in many cladistic analyses.

There is a need for the development of effective antiviral treatments. Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of viral RNA synthesis that has shown efficacy in vitro against MERS and SARS coronaviruses. Here, we tested the efficacy of prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir treatment in a nonhuman primate model of MERS-CoV infection. Prophylactic treatment prevented disease, and therapeutic treatment reduced virus replication and lung lesions. These data support the use of remdesivir in a clinical trial for MERS. It may also be considered for a wider range of coronaviruses, including the currently emerging novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV. This would be of great importance in the fight against the current pandemic. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Here, we show that the squid Euprymna scolopes regulates the provision of a single glycan to its symbiotic luminescent bacteria, Vibrio fischeri, in a diel rhythm. This glycan is catabolized by the symbionts, which in turn is required for the symbiont population to persist and for the adult organ to maintain its luminescence.

In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We found that pol II stalling at O2-EtdT and N3-EtdT sites is exacerbated by TFIIS-stimulated proofreading activity. Multiple transcriptional lesion bypass routes were found for the N3-EtdT lesion that disrupts base pairing. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas the more rigid uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into endos"

Chemotherapy is the most common treatment for breast cancer, but resistance to chemotherapy is a major obstacle to successful treatment. We find that breast cancer cells express the type I tyrosine kinaselike orphan receptor ROR1, which is up-regulated following treatment with chemotherapy. ROR1 expression is associated with the expression of genes induced by the activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or B lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region 1 homolog (BMI1). ROR1 expression also enhances the capacity of breast cancer cells to invade Matrigel, form spheroids, engraft in Rag2−/−γc−/− mice, or survive treatment with paclitaxel. We also find that the humanized anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab suppresses the expression of genes associated with breast cancer stemness, reduces activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or BMI1, and impairs the capacity of breast cancer PDXs to metastasize or reengraft Rag2−/−γc−/− mice.

In mammals, however, the CNS is incapable of regenerating after injury, and the only known regenerative capacity is in the peripheral nervous system. Here, we identify a form of regeneration in the adult nervous system that is independent of the MAPK signaling cascade. This form of regeneration is triggered by sensory activity and is reminiscent of a well-studied form of endogenous activity-dependent ectopic axon outgrowth in the same neuron type. These connections suggest that this form of regeneration may be a powerful platform for gene discovery in neuronal regeneration. Moreover, we note numerous similarities between this form of regeneration and conditioning, a phenomenon producing robust regeneration in the adult CNS.

Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Finally, we demonstrate that this signal is used by third-party listeners as a heuristic of how well people are connected: Conversations with faster response times were perceived as more connected than the same conversations with slower response times.

This study provides a link between tetrahydrobiopterin and ether lipid metabolism and opens new perspectives for the development of new therapeutic strategies for ether lipid-related diseases.

Here we propose a mechanism for memory that is based on changes in the excitability of neurons. This mechanism is adaptive, meaning that it changes in response to experience. We show that this mechanism can support memory on timescales ranging from milliseconds to seconds. We demonstrate that it can support the binding of linguistic features over time, which is a key feature of language processing. This work provides a step toward a computational neurobiology of language."

This behavior is reminiscent of the “saddle-node” bifurcation, which is a well-known phenomenon in dynamical systems theory. We also find that the network’s dynamics are sensitive to the environmental forcing, and that the system can exhibit a rich variety of dynamical behaviors, including chaotic dynamics. These results suggest that the environmental forcing may play a more important role in the dynamics of chemical networks than previously appreciated."

We validate a dynamic causal model of NMDAR-Ab effects on cortical microcircuitry and use this model to identify the key synaptic parameters that best explain EEG paroxysms in pediatric patients with NMDAR-Ab encephalitis. Finally, we show that NMDAR-Ab–related changes render microcircuitry critically susceptible to overt EEG paroxysms when these key parameters are changed, even though the same parameter fluctuations are tolerated in the in silico model of the control condition. These findings offer mechanistic insights into circuit-level dysfunction induced by NMDAR-Abs. This work may help to develop new therapeutic strategies for patients with NMDAR-Abs.

We show that RSPO certification is associated with reduced deforestation in oil palm plantations. However, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results suggest that certification is not yet delivering on its promise to reduce deforestation."

We find that multiple alleles can produce modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics, and that the modularity of secondary sexual characteristics can be increased by the acquisition of a new sex determination allele. These results provide context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of sex determination alleles in populations. (Simplified version available.)"

We sought to understand how Fe levels impact the retina, given that retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are also challenged by accumulations of bisretinoids that photogenerate reactive oxygen species and photodecompose into damaging aldehyde- and dicarbonyl-bearing species. We found that intracellular Fe promotes bisretinoid oxidation and degradation. This interpretation was supported by experiments showing that Fe chelation decreased the oxidative/degradation of the bisretinoid A2E in the presence of light and reduced cell death in cell-based experiments. Moreover, light-independent oxidation and degradation of A2E by Fenton chemistry products were evidenced by the consumption of A2E, release of dicarbonyls, and generation of oxidized A2E species in cell-free assays. These findings indicate that Fe is a key regulator of bisretinoid oxidation and degradation.

This finding suggests that specialization is not a dead end, and that morphological evolution can lead to new prey types.

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants."
