However, the structure of hydrate formed by a gas molecule, such as neon, is still unknown. In this work, we synthesized neon hydrate and studied its structure by in situ neutron diffraction. We found that neon atoms can be enclathrated in water molecules to form ice II-structured hydrates. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. This work provides a new route to study the structure of hydrate formed by a gas molecule. It also provides a new way to study the structure of hydrate formed by a liquid molecule. This work may also provide a new route to study the structure of hydrate formed by a solid molecule.

Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species and a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results show that myxozoans are cnidarians and are a sister taxon to P. hydriforme. We also show that myxozoans have one of the smallest reported animal genomes and that they have lost many genes involved in cell differentiation and development. These results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to"

The virus responsible for this disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is able to evade the host innate immune response by blocking nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are essential for induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 uses a viral accessory protein, Orf6, to block nuclear import of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex. We also show that Orf6 binds to the Nup98-Rae1 complex, which is essential for docking of the cargo-receptor complex at the nuclear pore complex. We further show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 of Orf6 abolishes its ability to block nuclear import and impair IFN antagonism. Our findings provide a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This mechanism may be used by other viruses to evade the host innate immune response. Our findings may also provide a target for the development of new"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

However, despite decades of research, we still do not know how diverse assemblages of LMH partition food resources. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant LMH species (six wild, one domestic) in semiarid African savanna. Our results show that LMH partition food resources in a variety of ways, including differential consumption of grasses versus nongrasses and spatiotemporal stratification in use of different parts of the same plant. Nonetheless, LMH diversity was not linked to plant diversity, suggesting that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results highlight the need to consider the taxonomic resolution of diet data when studying the coexistence of LMH. This will be critical for understanding the role of LMH in the conservation of African savanna biodiversity. (PsycINFO Database Record"

To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

Phylogenomic analyses of these datasets resolved controversial beetle relationships, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, plant cell wall-degrading enzymes obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, both major independent origins of specialized herbivory in beetles coincide with the first appearances of these genes in their genomes. We propose that these genes enabled efficient digestion of plant tissues, including lignocellulose in cell walls, facilitating the evolution of uniquely specialized plant-feeding habits, such as leaf mining and stem and wood boring. Beetle diversity thus appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal"

These findings suggest that fructose may be a weaker suppressor of appetite than glucose. Further, the findings suggest that the brain may be a potential target for interventions aimed at reducing food intake. (PsycINFO Database Record"

We find a common Bantu and Austronesian descent for all Malagasy individuals with a limited paternal contribution from Europe and the Middle East. Admixture and demographic growth happened recently, suggesting a rapid settlement of Madagascar during the last millennium. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, there are geographic influences on the present genomic diversity, independent of the admixture, showing that a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. These results provide insights into the settlement history of Madagascar and the origin of the Malagasy people. They"

We show that the presence of Ψ in mRNA can have a profound impact on translation. We find that the presence of Ψ can promote the low-level synthesis of multiple peptide products from a single mRNA sequence in the reconstituted translation system as well as human cells, and increases the rate of near-cognate Val-tRNAVal reacting on a ΨUU codon. The vast majority of Ψ moieties in mRNAs are found in coding regions, and our study suggests that one consequence of the ribosome encountering Ψ can be to modestly alter both translation speed and mRNA decoding.

We find that the evolution of an aquatic lifestyle is driving three of the four extant aquatic mammal clades toward a size attractor at ∼500 kg. This attractor is consistent with the energetic constraints of the aquatic environment. The existence of this size attractor and the relatively rapid selection toward, and limited deviation from, this attractor rule out most hypothesized drivers of size increase.

We found that rhinovirus replication was enhanced at 37 °C, and that this temperature-dependent growth phenotype was dependent on the MAVS protein, a key signaling adaptor of the RIG-I–like receptors. These findings demonstrate that in mouse airway cells, rhinovirus replicates preferentially at nasal cavity temperature due, in part, to a less efficient antiviral defense response of infected cells at cool temperature.

However, the extent of molecular continuity between males and females is largely unknown. We used proteomics and isotopic labeling to characterize the posttesticular life history of the Drosophila sperm proteome and determine the extent of molecular continuity between males and females. We show that female-derived proteins become associated with sperm immediately after mating and that they comprise nearly 20% of the postmating sperm proteome. These findings provide a comprehensive characterization of sperm proteome dynamics and expand our understanding of the critical process of sperm–FRT interactions. (PsycINFO Database Record"

The binding reaction is triggered, in part, by alterations in flow. We show that force application switches VWF to a second state with faster on-rate, providing a mechanism for activating VWF binding to platelets. Switching occurs near 10 pN, a force that also induces a state of the receptor−ligand complex with slower off-rate. Force greatly increases the effects of mutations in VWF, explaining pathophysiology. Conversion of single molecule kon (s−1) to bulk phase kon (s−1M−1) and the kon and koff values extrapolated to zero force for the low-force pathways show remarkably good agreement with bulk-phase measurements. This suggests that the single molecule data are not artifacts of the bulk phase. These results provide a mechanism for understanding the effects of mutations in VWF and may be relevant to other proteins that bind to receptors on the cell surface.

However, the ACI is complex and difficult to be well represented in current climate models. Progress on understanding ACI processes is hampered by inadequate observational capability. Here, we introduce the dual-field-of-view (FOV) high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) for simultaneously profiling aerosol and water cloud properties, especially water cloud microphysical properties. Continuous observations of aerosols and clouds using this instrument, verified by the Monte Carlo simulation and coincident observations of other techniques, were conducted to investigate the interactions between aerosol loading and water cloud microphysical properties. A case study over Beijing highlights the scientific potential of dual-FOV HSRL to become a significant contributor to the ACI investigations. The observed water cloud profiles identify that due to air entrainment its vertical structure is not perfectly adiabatic, as assumed by many current retrieval methods. Our ACI analysis shows increased aerosol loading led to increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius—consistent with expectations—but had no discernible increase on liquid water path. This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations obtained"

These changes in the red cell are correlated with parasite invasion efficiency. This finding suggests that the malaria parasite primes the RBC surface through its binding antigens, altering the biophysical nature of the target cell and thus reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion.

While low humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes them more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

This pattern of activity is consistent with a neural implementation of a merge operation, which applies equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity.

Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. We find that the web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to sense the motion of web threads, which allows the spider to remotely detect and localize the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself. The outsourcing and supersizing of auditory function in spiders provide unique features for studying extended and regenerative sensing and designing novel acoustic flow detectors for precise fluid dynamic measurement and manipulation.

We also identify nesocodin in the red nectar of the hummingbird-visited Jaltomata herrerae and provide molecular evidence for convergent evolution of this trait. This work demonstrates that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation. We also identify a previously undescribed enzyme that is necessary for the production of the red pigment.

Particularly striking are women with artificial skull deformations; the analysis of their collective genetic ancestry suggests an origin in southeastern Europe. In addition, functional variants revealed that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions.

Surprisingly, the results indicate that human pol δ maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion.

The noninvasive method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals; however, we did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis reveals corecruitment of RORα and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) on NF-κB target promoters and subsequent dismissal of CREB binding protein (CBP) and bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) for transcriptional repression. Together, we demonstrate that RORα/HDAC3-mediated attenuation of NF-κB signaling controls the balance of inflammatory responses, and therapeutic strategies targeting this"

This pandemic is generally understood as the consequence of a singular introduction of Yersinia pestis, after which the disease established itself in European rodents over four centuries. To locate these putative plague reservoirs, we studied the climate fluctuations that preceded regional plague epidemics, based on a dataset of 7,711 georeferenced historical plague outbreaks and 15 annually resolved tree-ring records from Europe and Asia. We provide evidence for repeated climate-driven reintroductions of the bacterium into European harbors from reservoirs in Asia, with a delay of 15 ± 1 y.

We demonstrate that monoclonal antibodies targeting IL1RAP have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We also show that the antibody can suppress the proliferation of primary human AML cells.

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GlpD) and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA. Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

Our findings suggest that the evolutionary rates of plastid genes are linked to the extent of functional reduction, and that the molecular evolution of plastid genes is shaped by the macroevolutionary events of the transition to parasitism.

The identification of the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms is challenging because of the complexity of the disorder. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility in autism and may facilitate the identification of the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms.

Here, we demonstrate that ets variant 2 (ETV2) alone can directly convert primary human adult skin fibroblasts into functional vascular endothelial cells (ETVECs). In coordination with endogenous FOXC2 in fibroblasts, transduced ETV2 elicits expression of multiple key endothelial development factors, including FLI1, ERG, and TAL1, and induces expression of endothelial functional molecules, including EGFL7 and von Willebrand factor. Consequently, ETVECs exhibits EC characteristics in vitro and forms mature functional vasculature in Matrigel plugs transplanted in NOD SCID mice. Our study indicates that the creation of ETVECs provides further understanding of human EC development induced by ETV2. This approach may be useful for the treatment of vascular disorders.

However, the role of FSIP1 in the progression and drug sensitivity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. (PsycINFO Database Record"

But how do we know when two people are connected? We asked pairs of friends and strangers to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

Siphonophores are pelagic colonial cnidarians that use their tentacles to capture prey. They are a model system to study the evolution of predatory morphology, as they have a highly specialized mode of prey capture. We show that siphonophores have evolved to capture different prey types, and that these transitions are linked to the evolution of the morphology and mode of evolution of their tentacles. Our findings contribute to understanding how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs."

The fossil record of the hominin hand is fragmentary, however, and there is a gap in the fossil record between 800,000 and 1.8 My old. This gap is well documented for the emergence and subsequent proliferation of Acheulian technology (shaped bifacial stone tools), and the origin of the human hand is a key component of the origin of this technology. Here we report the discovery of a hominin hand fossil from East Africa that provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key derived feature of the modern human hand. This fossil and the associated archaeological record provide a window into the evolution of the human hand. This work also highlights the importance of the fossil record in understanding the evolution of the human hand."

We have developed a series of small-molecule inhibitors of the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), which converts serine to glycine and a folate-bound one-carbon unit. We show that these compounds inhibit SHMT in cancer cells, and that dual knockout of SHMT1 and SHMT2 in cancer cells blocks tumor growth. We also show that cancer cells that are defective in glycine import are uniquely sensitive to SHMT inhibition. Thus, we have identified a metabolic vulnerability of cancer cells that can be exploited therapeutically. This work provides a foundation for the development of small-molecule inhibitors of SHMT as a cancer therapy. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The results have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. The study also highlights the importance of considering the role of natural landscapes in meeting nutrition goals, particularly in rural areas of low- and middle-income countries. This study also provides a proof of concept for the use of a modeling approach that combines two-way fixed-effects regression analysis with covariate balancing generalized propensity score (CBGPS) weighting to make causal inferences. This approach could be used in other settings to test the causal effects of environmental change on people’s diets."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We hypothesize that this trend is a consequence of the increasing size of modern farm vehicles, which are now approaching the weight of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods."
