In this work, we report the structure of neon hydrate at high pressure and low temperature. The structure of neon hydrate is similar to that of ice II, which is a new phase of water. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The structure of neon hydrate is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. This work provides a new way to study the structure of hydrate at high pressure and low temperature. It is also of great significance for the application of hydrate in the field of energy and environment. (Show more)"

In this paper, we provide a purely categorical characterization of the category of Hilbert space operators, which is the mathematical foundation of quantum theory. Our characterization is based on a set of axioms that are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. Our characterization is a step toward a more general characterization of the category of Hilbert space operators as a reflective subcategory of the category of vector spaces. This addresses a question about the mathematical foundations of quantum theory raised in reconstruction programs such as those of von Neumann, Mackey, Jauch, Piron, Abramsky, and Coecke."

To understand the extreme reduction in genome size and gene content that is characteristic of the Myxozoa, we compared the genomes of two myxozoans to the genome of a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results show that the myxozoan genome is one of the smallest reported in animals, and that the myxozoan body plan was reduced to a minimal set of genes and proteins. Our findings suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by a reduction in genome size and gene content. This is likely to be a general feature of the evolution of parasitic animals."

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

Meeting the food demand of this large population will become increasingly challenging as the Earth’s climate continues to warm. Earlier studies suggest that once the optimum growing temperature is exceeded, mean crop yields decline and the variability of yield increases even if interannual climate variability remains unchanged. Here, we quantify how yield variability will change in the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. Our results highlight the importance of heat tolerance in maize breeding and the urgency of investments in this area. They also underscore the instability of global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes.

Our results show that, even in a single study site, LMH species can be very different in their food-plant preferences, and that the degree of overlap in food-plant preferences is low. These results suggest that the current understanding of LMH niche partitioning may be incomplete, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results also suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages. Finally, our results highlight the importance of considering the taxonomic resolution of diet data when interpreting the results of niche partitioning studies.

Our findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure. This policy is a model for the future of conservation policy."

This problem can be addressed by the development of new antibacterial agents to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. In this study, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. This study demonstrates the potential of computational drug design for the discovery of new antibiotics. (Show more)"

Popular network architectures often add additional operations and connections to the standard architecture to enable training deeper networks. To achieve accurate results in practice, a large number of trainable parameters are often required. Here, we introduce a network architecture based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice, and automatically adapts to different problems. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data. Our results show that the proposed architecture is a promising alternative to existing architectures for many problems. We hope that this work will encourage further research in this area."

In this study, we show that the decapping enzyme responsible for removing the cap structure on Np4-capped RNAs is also critical for the rapid degradation of those transcripts. This enzyme, which is inactivated by the very conditions of disulfide stress that enable Np4 to accumulate, is a pyrophosphohydrolase that prefers to remove the terminal phosphate from Np4-capped RNAs over the triphosphorylated and diphosphorylated counterparts. This unique mode of substrate recognition positions the δ-phosphate, rather than the β-phosphate, for hydrolytic attack, generating triphosphorylated RNA as the primary product of decapping. The differential impact of this enzyme on the rates at which capped and uncapped termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress.

They open and close their pore gates to regulate ion flow. K+ channels commonly possess two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that BK channel C-type inactivation is state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. Our findings provide a new perspective on the regulation of ion flow by ion channels. They also provide a possible mechanism for the BK channel’s normal closing and its unique properties of fast activation and slow inactivation. (Show more)"

Here, we show that the malaria parasite binds to the surface of the RBC, and this interaction alters the biophysical properties of the cell, reducing the energy barrier to invasion. This finding represents a major change in our understanding of the invasion process and suggests that the malaria parasite is, in fact, a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces working together to facilitate entry.

Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

We find that the spider’s web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to capture the sound-induced air particle movements that approach the maximum physical efficiency better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By sensing the motion of web threads, the spider remotely detects and localizes the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave, such as those emitted by approaching prey or predators. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than"

This epidemic marked the start of the second plague pandemic, which lasted in Europe until the early 19th century. The current understanding of this pandemic is that it was the consequence of a singular introduction of Yersinia pestis, after which the disease established itself in European rodents over four centuries. Our analysis provides evidence for repeated climate-driven reintroductions of the bacterium into European harbors from reservoirs in Asia, with a delay of 15 ± 1 y. This suggests that the disease was not established in Europe before the arrival of the next plague pandemic.

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis remain unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We found that the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop).

To understand the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV, we engineered viruses with mutations that blocked sequential proteolysis of the virus-surface spike (S) glycoproteins. We found that these mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence. Our findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and may inform the development of antiviral strategies. (Show more)"

Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus using in vitro experiments. We demonstrated that this interaction takes place in infected cells and is required for optimal viral replication. Disruption of this interaction decreased the amount of viral RNA in the viral particles, resulting in an eightfold increase in empty viral particles. Our experiments indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions. The lack of conservation of these interactions might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses. (Show more)"

We connect changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods with economic and demographic data and find that three factors predict neighborhood improvement: (i) the density of college-educated adults, (ii) the initial appearance of the neighborhood, and (iii) the proximity of the neighborhood to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities. Our method can be used to study the physical dynamics of other cities and other types of urban change. We hope that our method will be useful to researchers and practitioners interested in urban change."

We estimate that the eclipse phase for ZIKV, the time between cell infection and viral production, is most likely short (∼4 h), the median within-host basic reproductive number R0 is 10.7, the rate of viral production is rapid (&gt;25,000 virions d−1), and the lifetime of an infected cell while producing virus is ∼5 h. We also estimate that the minimum number of virions produced by an infected cell over its lifetime is ∼5,500.

We found that the dominant RSN in healthy subjects was topographically similar to the default mode network. In contrast, in Parkinson’s disease, this RSN was subordinated to an independent disease-related pattern. Network functionality was assessed by quantifying metabolic RSN expression in cerebral blood flow PET scans acquired at rest and during task performance.

Our results provide insights into the role of Si in plant defense and may lead to the development of Si-based strategies for insect pest control. (Show more)"

We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 (exocyst component of 70 kDa) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and offers a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show here that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants.
