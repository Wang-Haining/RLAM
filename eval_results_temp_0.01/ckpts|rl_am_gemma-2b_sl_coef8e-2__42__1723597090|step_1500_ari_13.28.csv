In this paper, we provide a purely categorical characterization of the category of Hilbert space operators, which is the mathematical foundation of quantum theory. Our characterization is based on a set of axioms that are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. This addresses a question about the foundations of quantum theory raised in reconstruction programs such as those of von Neumann, Mackey, Jauch, Piron, Abramsky, and Coecke. Our results provide a mathematical foundation for the program of showing that the category of Hilbert space operators is equivalent to the category of continuous linear operators between Banach spaces. This is a central result in the reconstruction of quantum mechanics from the category of observables."

Here, we report the first genomic and transcriptomic assemblies for two species of myxozoans, and we compare these to the genome of a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results show that the myxozoan body plan is the result of a dramatic reduction in gene content and genome size. This reduction is accompanied by the loss of key signaling pathways and transcriptional factors, suggesting that the myxozoan transition to parasitism was accompanied by a reduction in complexity. Our results provide insights into the evolution of the Myxozoa and the origin of parasitic animals. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

These results suggest that the extent to which LMH partition food resources may be more limited than is currently recognized, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results also suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages.

The strategy is based on the prediction of the solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity of acylide antibiotics to the ribosome. We show that the best candidate, which was predicted by our strategy, is up to 56 times more active than telithromycin, the only approved acylide antibiotic, and is active against multiple antibiotic-resistant pathogens. The strategy can be used to identify new antibiotics with improved properties, which is essential for the development of new drugs.

This study shows that the evolution of an aquatic lifestyle is driving three of the four extant aquatic mammal clades toward a size attractor at ∼500 kg. The existence of this body size attractor and the relatively rapid selection toward, and limited deviation from, this attractor rule out most hypothesized drivers of size increase. These three independent body size increases and a shared aquatic optimum size are consistent with control by differences in the scaling of energetic intake and cost functions with body size between the terrestrial and aquatic realms. The optimum size occurs at an intermediate value where thermoregulatory costs are low but feeding efficiency remains high. Rather than being released from size pressures, water-dwelling mammals are driven and confined to larger body sizes by the strict energetic demands of the aquatic medium."

Here, we show that soluble Aβ species are the most toxic amyloid species within the brain and are responsible for the initiation of the AD-related immune response. We also demonstrate that the intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ is a significant risk factor for the development of the AD-related immune response, which may precede the formation of Aβ plaques. Our findings suggest that the Aβ-burdened neuron is a primary proinflammatory agent, implicating the intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ as a significant immunological component in the AD pathogenesis.

They open and close their pore gates to allow or block ion flow. The pore gates are the main targets of drug binding and modulation. The activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery of K+ channels are the two main processes that regulate ion flow. We found that the BK channel’s activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery are closely related. The BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and its rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. We propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. This study provides a new perspective on the regulation of ion flow by ion channels. (Show more)

Here, we show that EBA175 binding to the erythrocyte surface leads to an increase in the tension of the red cell cytoskeleton and a reduction in the bending modulus of the membrane. We show that these changes in the red cell biophysical properties correlate with the ability of the parasite to invade the erythrocyte. This finding suggests that the malaria parasite primes the erythrocyte surface through its binding antigens, altering the biophysical nature of the target cell and thus reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion. This would constitute a major change in our concept of malaria parasite invasion, suggesting it is, in fact, a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces working together to facilitate entry.

The impact of environmental factors on influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity increases susceptibility to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that low humidity impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

This merge operation is consistent with a left-corner parser that applies equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity.

Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. We find that the spider’s web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to sense the motion of web threads, which allows the spider to remotely detect and localize the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself. The spider also enables the flexibility to functionally adjust and regularly regenerate its external ""eardrum"" according to its needs. The outsourcing and supersizing"

Our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities. Our method can be used to monitor the physical changes of cities over time and to study the spatial dynamics of urban change.

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The RNA encodes a 28-amino acid protein that interacts with glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and increases its activity. We also show that the RNA base pairs with the cadA and galE promoters and that the base pairing interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA. These results demonstrate that the translation and base-pairing functions of the RNA compete. This is an example of a dual-function RNA that has been overlooked in the past. The discovery of this RNA is important because it demonstrates that the translation and base-pairing functions of sRNAs compete with each other. This is an important observation because it suggests that the two functions of a given sRNA may be regulated by the same mechanism. This is a general principle that may be important for understanding the regulation of many sRNAs."

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis remain unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated the impact of O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (EtdT) lesions on pol II transcription. We found that pol II is stalled at the EtdT lesions, and the stalling is exacerbated by TFIIS-stimulated proofreading activity. We also found that the EtdT lesions can induce multiple transcriptional bypass routes, and the error-free route is favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route is observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II, which is involved in modulating the translocation of minor-groove alkylated DNA template after nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion.

However, the coastal zone is also the first to be impacted by nutrient pollution, which can lead to harmful algal blooms and oxygen depletion. We show that the coastal zone is not only impacted by nutrients from large rivers, but also by nutrients from small streams that drain into the lake. These small streams are often overlooked in nutrient management efforts, but our results suggest that they may be a significant source of nutrients to the coastal zone. Our findings highlight the importance of small streams in nutrient pollution and the need to address them in nutrient management efforts."

Certification is the tool most used to fulfill these procurement policies, and around 20% of global palm oil production was certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) in 2017. However, the effect of certification on deforestation in oil palm plantations remains unclear. Here, we show that certification is associated with reduced deforestation in Indonesia, the leading producer of palm oil. Certification appears to be most effective in reducing deforestation in areas with the least residual forest cover. Nevertheless, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation."

This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

The RPE is also challenged by the accumulation of a lipid-soluble fluorescent metabolite of vitamin A that is oxidized and degraded by ROS. We show that the levels of iron (Fe) in the retina, as reflected in the expression of the transferrin receptor, impacts the levels of ROS and the degradation of a fluorescent metabolite of vitamin A.

In this paper, we show that the evolution of specialization in siphonophores is not a dead end, but rather a process that has led to the evolution of specialization on different prey types. This process is driven by the evolution of the tentilla, the structures that are specialized for prey capture. Our results provide a broader perspective on the evolution of specialization, and help us understand how specialization has shaped present-day food webs."

We show that this inhibitor is effective in blocking colon cancer tumor growth in mice. We also show that the inhibitor is effective in inhibiting the growth of a number of cancer cell lines, but is particularly effective in inhibiting B-cell lines. This is a significant finding, as B-cell lines are the most common type of cancer cell line used in cancer cell-line screens. Thus, we propose that SHMT inhibition is a promising strategy for treating B-cell cancers."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the discovery of a 130-m"
