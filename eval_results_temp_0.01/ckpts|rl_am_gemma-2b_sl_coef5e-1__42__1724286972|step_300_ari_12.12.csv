However, its foundations have been a matter of debate for more than a century. In this paper, we provide a purely categorical approach to quantum theory. The axioms are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. This approach addresses a question about the foundations of quantum theory raised in reconstruction programs such as those of von Neumann, Mackey, Jauch, Piron, Abramsky, and Coecke. Our results show that the category of Hilbert spaces and bounded linear operators is equivalent to the category of measurable spaces and measurable functions. This result is a step toward a categorical approach to quantum theory."

The evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, and a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the genomes of two myxozoans and a cnidarian parasite. Our results show that the myxozoan body plan is reduced to the bare minimum required for survival as a parasitic organism. This reduction is accompanied by a reduction in genome size and gene content. Our findings suggest that the Myxozoa are a sister group to the cnidarians. Copyright © 2015.

The IFN pathway is a major antiviral response that is activated upon sensing of viral RNA. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes. Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This article is protected by copyright.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1.

This study quantifies the magnitude of this increase and its consequences for global food security. We find that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields increases almost everywhere to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields. For the top four maize-exporting countries, which account for 87% of global maize exports, the probability that they have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. They also underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

One reason for this is that we lack a comprehensive understanding of how herbivores partition food resources. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammalian herbivores in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in body size and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages. Our findings also highlight the importance of species-level diet analyses for understanding the impacts of herbivores on ecosystems. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc."

However, the global load of floating plastic debris is still unknown. We show that the global load of floating plastic debris is far less than expected. This is mainly due to size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean.

Our findings suggest that the use of these drugs should be limited in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling.

It was science-based, incorporated adaptive management, and was the first to require monitoring of biodiversity. We used &gt;25 years of bird surveys to test the influence of the NWFP on biodiversity. Our results show that the NWFP halted the decline of early-seral bird populations, but failed to reverse the decline of older-forest–associated species. The NWFP failed to halt the decline of older forests, and the proportion of older forests declined. The NWFP failed to halt the decline of early-seral bird populations, and the proportion of early-seral ecosystems increased. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure.

The proposed architecture is based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters."

We observe dramatic shifts in effective moisture, resulting in large-scale changes in one of the world’s largest lakes and most diverse freshwater ecosystems. Results show evidence for 24 lake level drops of more than 200 m during the Late Quaternary, including 15 lowstands when water levels were more than 400 m lower than modern. A dramatic shift is observed at the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT), consistent with far-field climate forcing, which separates vastly different hydroclimate regimes before and after ∼800,000 years ago. Before 800 ka, lake levels were lower, indicating a climate drier than today, and water levels changed frequently. Following the MPT high-amplitude lake level variations dominate the record.

We used a comprehensive dataset of 89 genes to estimate the timing and rates of beetle diversification. We also traced the evolution of genes enabling symbiont-independent digestion of plant cell walls. Phylogenomic analyses of these uniquely comprehensive datasets resolved controversial beetle relationships and dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous. We found that plant cell wall-degrading enzymes may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles. These novel genes triggered adaptive radiations that resulted in nearly half of all living beetle species. We propose that beetles diversified due to low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding symbiont-independent digestion of plant cell walls.

To address this challenge, we developed a deep learning algorithm to enhance the neutralizing activity of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our algorithm can be used to optimize antibody sequences to improve binding affinity against multiple variants. We applied our algorithm to a human antibody, P36-5D2, which is effective against SARS-CoV-2 Alpha, Beta, and Gamma but not Delta. We demonstrated that our algorithm can improve the antibody’s potency against Delta by ∼10- to 600-fold. Our results suggest that our algorithm can be used to engineer antibodies for the current and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

APOE is a major component of the classical complement cascade and its presence in the brain increases the risk of AD by ∼12-fold. The role of APOE in AD pathogenesis is not yet clear. Here we show that APOE isoform regulates the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes. APOE2 enhances the rate of phagocytosis of synapses by astrocytes, whereas APO4 decreases it. We also found that APOE alleles affect the rate of C1q accumulation in hippocampus, which may represent the accumulation of senescent synapses with enhanced vulnerability to complement-mediated degeneration. These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes. They also suggest the hypothesis that AD susceptibility of APOE4 may originate in part from defective phagocytic capacity of astrocytes which accelerates the rate of accumulation of C1q-coated senescent synapses, enhancing synaptic vulnerability to complement-mediated neurodegeneration. This hypothesis is supported by the recent finding that APOE4 knock-in mice have significantly reduced phagocytic capacity of astrocytes. This"

However, its function in mitochondria of normal and transformed cells is more complex than previously appreciated. We have shown that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 may act as a tumor suppressor in some settings. This study provides a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc."

It is essential for cell migration, cell division, and cytokinesis. ADF is also involved in the formation of stress fibers and lamellipodia. The ADF/cofilin complex is the only known ADF/cofilin complex that can sever actin filaments. However, how it does so is not known. Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to study the action of ADF/cofilin in different mechanical situations. We find that ADF/cofilin can sever filaments under mechanical stress. We propose a mechanochemical model that explains our results. This model suggests that ADF/cofilin can sever highly connected filament networks far more efficiently than nonconnected filaments. This finding is important for understanding the function of ADF/cofilin in cells. It may also have implications for the design of new actin depolymerizing factor/cofilin inhibitors.

Here we show that the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses the mechanical activity of its surface adhesin type IV pili to sense surfaces. This mechanosensory system is mediated by the type IV pili-binding methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein-like protein PilJ. The pili-mediated surface sensing system is required for long-term attachment to surfaces and for the regulation of virulence. This mechanochemical model for surface sensing provides a mechanism for how bacteria can use pili for sensing and motility. This work also demonstrates that type IV pili can be used for sensing surfaces on short timescales. This mechanochemical model for surface sensing may be applicable to other bacteria.

This is the earliest known evidence for economic exploitation of chickens. Our results are supported by a survey of chicken remains from 234 sites in the Southern Levant, spanning more than three millennia.

In bacteria, they function as precursors to nucleoside tetraphosphate (Np4) RNA caps. Np4 decapping is critical for the rapid degradation of those RNAs, which is required for the survival of cells experiencing stress. Here, we show that the RNA pyrophosphohydrolase RppH, which is inactivated by stress, preferentially decapsulates Np4-capped RNAs. This enzyme recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5′ termini, resulting in a one-nucleotide shift in substrate specificity. The unconventional manner in which RppH recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress.

However, ACI is difficult to be well represented in current climate models. Progress on understanding ACI processes is hampered by inadequate observational capability. Here, we introduce a new instrument, the dual-field-of-view high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL), to investigate ACI. The HSRL can measure aerosol and cloud properties simultaneously. We demonstrate the capability of the HSRL to investigate ACI. The observations show that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI.

The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that BK channels can exhibit slow C-type inactivation/recovery. We propose that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also found that BK channel C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent.

These changes in the RBC membrane are correlated with parasite invasion efficiency. This finding suggests that the malaria parasite primes the RBC membrane, reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion.

Our data indicate that while men generally had ancestry that closely resembles modern northern and central Europeans, women exhibit a very high genetic heterogeneity; this includes signals of genetic ancestry ranging from western Europe to East Asia. Particularly striking are women with artificial skull deformations; the analysis of their collective genetic ancestry suggests an origin in southeastern Europe. In addition, functional variants revealed that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago. Our results indicate that complex demographic processes during the Early Medieval period may have contributed in an unexpected way to shape the modern European genetic landscape.

The bat origin of MERS-CoV suggests that bats are the natural reservoir of the virus. However, the bat coronaviruses that are closely related to MERS-CoV are not known to cause disease in animals or humans. To understand how these bat coronaviruses can cause disease in humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of two bat coronaviruses, HKU4 and HKU5. We found that the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the bat coronaviruses are different from those of MERS-CoV. These results suggest that the bat coronaviruses have adapted to use human cells for cross-species transmission.

The stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. In S. cerevisiae, the pol δ holoenzyme is extremely stable and requires an active displacement mechanism for recycling and exchange. In humans, the pol δ holoenzyme is less stable but still maintains a tight association with PCNA. We designed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. Our results indicate that human pol δ maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion.

In this paper, we describe an improved RNA polymerase ribozyme that can synthesize a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase ribozyme can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins.

Neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods.

We show that every repeated game with tail-measurable payoffs admits an ε-equilibrium, for every ε&gt;0, provided that the set of players is finite or countably infinite and the action sets are finite.

We estimate that the pandemic will result in a 1.13-y reduction in life expectancy at birth and a 0.87-y reduction at age 65 y. The Black and Latino populations are estimated to experience declines in life expectancy at birth of 2.10 and 3.05 y, respectively. These projections imply an increase of nearly 40% in the Black−White life expectancy gap, from 3.6 y to over 5 y. Latinos, who have consistently experienced lower mortality than Whites, would see their more than 3-y survival advantage reduced to less than 1 y. These findings underscore the need for urgent action to address the structural inequalities that increase risk of exposure to COVID-19 and mortality risk for those infected."

We show that the glycan is provided only at dusk, when the squid is at its most vulnerable to predation. We also show that the glycan is required for the persistence of the symbionts, and that its catabolism increases the acidity of the symbiotic habitat, which enhances the luminescence of the symbionts.

We demonstrate that the evolutionary rates of plastid genes increase progressively during the transition to a parasitic lifestyle. The increase in evolutionary rates is linked to the loss of photosynthesis and the establishment of the parasitic lifestyle. The increase in evolutionary rates reaches several new rate equilibria, possibly relating to the modified protein turnover rates in heterotrophic plastids.

We found that ASK1 deficiency in microglia/macrophages and astrocytes reduced neuroinflammation in the later stage of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). ASK1 signaling in microglia/macrophages played a major role in generating and maintaining disease. Activated astrocytes produce key inflammatory mediators, including CCL2, which further activated and recruited microglia/macrophages. Astrocyte-specific analysis revealed CCL2 expression was higher in the later stage compared with the early stage, suggesting a greater proinflammatory role of astrocytes in the later stage.

Thus, reducing greenhouse gas emissions will reduce the probability that dry precipitation years are also warm. Our results also suggest that the probability that a dry precipitation year is also warm will increase with cumulative emissions even if the global mean temperature increase is below the Paris Agreement target of 1.5 °C.

The etiology of autism is so complicated because it involves the effects of variants of several hundred risk genes along with the contribution of environmental factors. Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. As an alternative approach, extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying the convergence of the targets and functions of the autism-risk genes to facilitate mapping out causal paths. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that behavioral inflexibility resulted from the inability to forget. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a framework for understanding the etiology of autism. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

They also show that individual-level differences in responsiveness to news content are substantial. These findings help account for the prevalence of negative news content, and they suggest that there may be reason to reconsider the conventional journalistic wisdom that “if it bleeds, it leads.”"

The disease is caused by mutations in numerous genes, including SOD1, TDP-43, and FUS. These genes encode proteins that are highly aggregation-prone and form intracellular inclusion bodies. Here, we show that the inclusion bodies in ALS are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins. Rather, the inclusion bodies are supersaturated with proteins that are not native interaction partners. We propose that the inclusion bodies in ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons. Thus, the inclusion bodies in ALS are a result of a progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in motor neurons. This study suggests that the inclusion bodies in ALS are a unique pathological feature of this disease. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc."

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into endosomes. Uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases.

However, the mechanisms underlying this process are not fully understood. Here we show that hypobaric hypoxia induces cerebral edema in rats and that this process is mediated by the hypoxic release of corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) from the hypothalamus. CRF acts on the cerebral cortex via its receptor CRFR1 to trigger signaling of cAMP/PKA in astrocytes, leading to activation of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and cerebral edema. This study provides insights into the mechanisms of cerebral edema induced by hypobaric hypoxia. It also provides a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of cerebral edema.

The underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. We show that altered nutrient cycling during heat stress is a primary driver of the functional breakdown of the symbiosis. Heat stress increased the metabolic energy demand of the coral host, which was compensated by the catabolic degradation of amino acids. The resulting shift from net uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont subsequently promoted the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host. Energy limitation and altered symbiotic nutrient cycling are thus key factors in the early heat stress response, directly contributing to the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis. Interpreting the stability of the coral holobiont in light of its metabolic interactions provides a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

The role of fibrous sheath interacting protein 1 (FSIP1) in TNBC has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 is highly expressed in TNBC and is associated with poor prognosis. FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. This article is protected by copyright.

Moreover, we found that gut leakiness is associated with altered gut microbiota composition and activity. These results suggest that the gut microbiota may be involved in the development of alcohol dependence. Thus, the gut microbiota seems to be a previously unidentified target in the management of alcohol dependence. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The biosynthesis of these volatile chemicals is poorly understood, and the only known nitrogenous volatiles are produced in tomato fruit. We report the identification of a gene essential for the production of all the nitrogenous volatiles in tomato fruit. The gene encodes a flavin-dependent monooxygenase that catalyzes sequential hydroxylation reactions to produce these compounds. This pathway is unique among known nitrogenous volatile biosynthetic pathways in plants. The identification of this pathway will enable the development of tomato cultivars with improved flavor.

However, these threats are frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. Our findings have important implications for the design of biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation policies. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc."

We found that neurons in the superficial layer of MECs form clusters that are topographically organized. Grid cells, which are thought to be essential for navigation, are topographically organized and form clusters that are distinct from those of other neurons.

Here we show that striatonigral fibers originating in striosomes form highly unusual bouquet-like arborizations that target bundles of ventrally extending dopamine-containing dendrites and clusters of their parent nigral cell bodies. These clustered cell bodies in turn project to the striatum as part of the classic nigrostriatal pathway. Thus, these striosome–dendron bouquets likely represent subsystems with the nigro–striato–nigral loop that are affected in human disorders including Parkinson’s disease. Given evidence that striosomes receive input from cortical regions related to the control of mood and motivation and that they link functionally to reinforcement and decision-making, the striosome–dendron bouquets could be critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease.

We show that certification is associated with reduced deforestation in Indonesia. Certification lowered deforestation by 33% from a counterfactual of 9.8 to 6.6% y−1. Nevertheless, most plantations contained little residual forest when they received certification. As a result, certified areas held less than 1% of forests remaining within oil palm plantations in 2015. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation.

This study provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key derived characteristic of the human hand. The fossil provides the earliest evidence for the evolution of a key derived characteristic of the human hand. This finding suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato.

We report the discovery of small-molecule dual inhibitors of human serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1/2 (SHMT1/2). These compounds are effective in cancer cell lines and xenograft models of colon cancer. We also show that one-carbon metabolism is a targetable metabolic deficiency of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. This work provides a foundation for the development of metabolically targeted therapies for cancer. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

However, the causal effects of deforestation on people’s diets have not been studied. We show that deforestation in rural Tanzania led to a reduction in people’s fruit and vegetable consumption and thus vitamin A adequacy of their diets. Conversely, we found that forest fragmentation led to an increase in fruit and vegetable consumption and dietary vitamin A adequacy. These findings have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals.

However, the expansion of mechanization has come at the cost of soil degradation. We show that the increase in farm vehicle weight has led to the propagation of subsoil compaction into deeper soil layers. This has resulted in a global map of subsoil compaction susceptibility, with 20% of arable land at risk. We hypothesize that the development of subsoil compaction is a recent phenomenon, and that the large sauropods roaming the Earth millions of years ago would have caused similar damage to the soil. This suggests that the ecological strategies of these giants may have included the development of fixed foraging trails. Our findings highlight the need for a more stringent design of farm machinery to reduce subsoil compaction. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
