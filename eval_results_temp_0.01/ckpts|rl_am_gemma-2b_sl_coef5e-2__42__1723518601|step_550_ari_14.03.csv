Here, we present a comparative analysis of the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species and a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results show that myxozoans are cnidarians and are a sister taxon to P. hydriforme. In addition, our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. These results have implications for understanding the origin of parasitism and the evolution of the Myxozoa."

The SARS-CoV-2 virus is able to evade the host innate immune response by blocking the nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, which are key factors for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes. In this study, we show that the viral accessory protein Orf6 is responsible for this anti-IFN activity. We found that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and interacts with Nup98-Rae1. We also show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its anti-IFN activity. Our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.

We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them.

This discrepancy is explained by the selective removal of plastic debris larger than 1 mm by the ocean interior. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered.

IGF2BP1 is expressed in the fetal liver and is down-regulated in the adult bone marrow. In the fetal liver, IGF2BP1 is associated with the heterochronic let-7 miRNA pathway and mediates the developmental silencing of adult hemoglobin expression. In the adult bone marrow, IGF2BP1 is associated with the BCL11A transcription factor and mediates the loss of fetal hemoglobin expression.

In this study, we found that the mTORC1 signaling axis is required for cancer cells to survive ferroptosis, a form of regulated necrosis driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. We also found that the mTORC1 inhibitor everolimus sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis induction, and that the combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction results in near-complete tumor regression in preclinical models. These findings suggest that mTORC1 inhibition may be a promising strategy for cancer therapy in the future. (PsycINFO Database Record"

The most common drugs for treating hypertension are L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs). LCCBs are associated with heart failure, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we show that LCCBs activate Ca2+ signaling pathways that promote vascular remodeling. Our data indicate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. Our findings provide a rationale for the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in patients with cardiovascular disease. This study provides a mechanistic explanation for the association of LCCBs with heart failure and may lead to the development of new strategies for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

We show that the NWFP has not yet been successful in reversing the decline of older-forest–associated bird populations. The NWFP has halted clearcutting on federal land, but this has so far been insufficient to reverse declines in older-forest–associated bird populations. We also show that the early-seral ecosystem area has been stable, but declined in two ecoregions—the Coast Range and Cascades—along with early-seral bird populations. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure.

The vector of the Black Death, which caused the pandemic, is still debated. We developed a compartmental model for plague transmission by a human ectoparasite vector and found that this model fits mortality curves from nine outbreaks in Europe better than models for rodent or pneumonic transmission. Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346–1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats. This study also highlights the importance of using a mechanistic model to understand historical epidemics. Our model can be used to study the impact of vector control on plague epidemics. It can also be extended to other diseases spread by human ectoparasites. Finally, our results have implications for the spread of plague in the Middle Ages and the Black Death in the 14th century.</em>"

We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This study provides a mechanistic explanation for the role of TRAP1 in cancer and suggests that TRAP1 may be a potential target for cancer therapy. (PsycINFO Database Record"

We used a grid-based approach to sample genomic diversity across Madagascar and found that the Malagasy population is a mixture of Bantu and Austronesian populations, with a limited contribution from Europe and the Middle East. The distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. These results provide insights into the settlement history of Madagascar and the genetic consequences of the human colonization of the island. They also highlight the importance of considering the spatial resolution of the sampling when studying the genetic diversity of human populations.

SOC systems are characterized by the presence of a power-law distribution of activity, and the system’s activity is self-regulated to a critical value. The sandpile model is the archetypal SOC system. In this paper, we describe a continuous model of SOC, which is a certain scaling limit of the sandpile model.

They are also the targets of many diseases. The activation and inactivation of ion channels are important for their function. The activation gate is the main site of channel opening and is usually located at the intracellular end of the channel. The inactivation gate is the main site of channel closing and is usually located at the selectivity filter. We found that the BK channel lacks an activation gate and normally shows no C-type inactivation. We also found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. Our findings may help us understand the mechanism of the BK channel’s normal closing and its disease-related opening. They may also provide a new approach for the development of drugs for diseases caused by the BK channel’s abnormal opening. (Less simplification is needed.)"

We isolate the changes in the cytoskeleton and membrane and show that reduction in the bending modulus is directly correlated with parasite invasion efficiency. These data suggest that the malaria parasite primes the erythrocyte surface through its binding antigens, altering the biophysical nature of the target cell and thus reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion.

We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

We find that the spider’s web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to sense the motion of web threads, which allows the spider to remotely detect and localize the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself. The outsourcing and supersizing of auditory function in spiders provides unique features for studying extended and regenerative sensing and designing novel acoustic flow detectors for precise fluid dynamic measurement and manipulation.

Our results provide evidence for the involvement of ALKALs in neural crest development and suggest ALKALs as potential therapeutic targets for neuroblastoma. Our findings are of general interest for the understanding of ALKALs function in development and for the development of ALKALs as therapeutic targets in cancer."

Our results suggest that the plague lineage we recovered from the Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age was nonflea-adapted and may have been extinct by the Bronze Age. We also discover the presence of the flea-adapted form of plague in Bronze Age Iberia, suggesting a much wider geographic spread of this form of plague than previously thought.

We find that women’s and men’s endorsement of HM predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. HM was associated with less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia, but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors. The findings highlight the importance of psychological examinations of masculinity as a cultural ideology to understand how men’s and women’s endorsement of HM legitimizes patriarchal dominance and reinforces gender, race, and class-based hierarchies via candidate support. They also have implications for understanding the role of masculinity in the 2020 American presidential election. (Less)"

Particularly striking are women with artificial skull deformations; the analysis of their collective genetic ancestry suggests an origin in southeastern Europe. In addition, functional variants revealed that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago. These results indicate that complex demographic processes during the Early Medieval period may have contributed in an unexpected way to shape the modern European genetic landscape."

This process is driven by the activity of DNA polymerases, which synthesize new DNA strands from the template. The lagging strand DNA polymerase δ (pol δ) is responsible for synthesizing the DNA strand that is complementary to the template strand. In humans, pol δ is anchored to the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) sliding clamp to form a holoenzyme. The stability of this complex is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. We developed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. Our results indicate that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This work provides a unique perspective on the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme and its implications for DNA replication. It also provides a foundation for future studies on the role of the PCNA sliding clamp in DNA replication."

The copper-dependent antimicrobial properties of xan BGC-derived isocyanides suggest a role for these compounds in the control of copper levels in the environment and in the host–fungus interaction. The existence of the xan BGC in several filamentous fungi suggests a heretofore unknown role of eukaryotic natural products in copper homeostasis and mediation of interactions with competing microbes.

We show that hypoxia induces expression of the m6A demethylase AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), which increases the expression of pluripotency factors and the breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) phenotype. ALKBH5 expression is induced by hypoxia through the HIF-1α and HIF-2α pathways, and is required for the BCSC phenotype. ALKBH5 expression is increased in human breast cancer tumors, and its expression can be used as a biomarker for the identification of BCSCs. Thus, ALKBH5 expression in breast cancer cells is induced by hypoxia through the HIF pathway, and may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of breast cancer. (PsycINFO Database Record"

The term abortivum in Latin has been used to suggest that the skins were from aborted animals, but this has been challenged by others. Here, we report a simple and objective method to identify the animal origin of parchment. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals, but did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides. These results suggest that ultrafine vellum does not necessarily derive from the use of abortive or newborn animals with ultrathin hides, but could equally well reflect a production process that allowed the skins of maturing animals of several species to be rendered into vellum of equal quality and fineness. This method could be used to identify the animal origin of parchment in the future."

The age of the extinction is constrained to 251.941 ± 0.037 and 251.880 ± 0.031 Mya, an interval of 60 ± 48 ka. The carbon cycle reorganization that preceded the extinction is punctuated by a sharp (3‰) negative spike in the isotopic composition of carbonate carbon. The carbon cycle volatility persists for ∼500 ka before a return to near preextinction values. The precise age model will allow a refined evaluation of the relative roles of rate-dependent processes contributing to the extinction, allowing insight into postextinction ecosystem expansion. The age model will also be critical for evaluating the plausibility of trigger and kill mechanisms."

IBD is a heterogeneous disease, and the exact pathogenesis is still unclear. In this study, we found that retinoic acid-related orphan receptor α (RORα) is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis by attenuating nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcriptional activity. RORα deletion in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) leads to excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis reveals corecruitment of RORα and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) on NF-κB target promoters and subsequent dismissal of CREB binding protein (CBP) and bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) for transcriptional repression. These results suggest that RORα/HDAC3-mediated attenuation of NF-κB signaling controls the balance of inflammatory responses, and therapeutic strategies targeting this"

The proof relies on techniques from stochastic games and from alternating-move games with Borel-measurable payoffs. The result is a generalization of the classical result of Moulin and Zamir (1982) for finite games. Our proof is constructive, in the sense that it provides an algorithm for finding an ε-equilibrium.

We use a high-resolution climate model to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the probability of occurrence of multiyear rainfall deficits in southwestern South Africa. We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% by the year 2100 under an intermediate-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5 [SSP2-4.5]) and to 80% under a high-emission scenario (SSP5-8.5). These results highlight the strong sensitivity of the drought risk in SSA to future anthropogenic emissions. They also highlight the importance of regional climate modeling for understanding the risks of climate change in water-scarce regions. (Less)

We found that ASK1 deficiency in microglia/macrophages and astrocytes ameliorated EAE severity, whereas ASK1 deficiency in T cells and dendritic cells had no significant effects on EAE. ASK1 signaling in microglia/macrophages plays a major role in generating and maintaining disease. Activated astrocytes produce key inflammatory mediators, including CCL2, that further activated and recruited microglia/macrophages, in an astrocytic ASK1-dependent manner. Astrocyte-specific analysis revealed CCL2 expression was higher in the later stage compared with the early stage, suggesting a greater proinflammatory role of astrocytes in the later stage. Our findings suggest glial ASK1 as a promising therapeutic target for reducing neuroinflammation."

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility in autism and suggest that forgetting is a potential therapeutic target for autism. This study also provides a framework for the identification of the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms. (PsycINFO Database Record"

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced mutagenesis remain largely unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated the impact of alkylation on transcription. We found that the transcription reaction is stalled at alkylated DNA template. The stalling is exacerbated by the proofreading activity of RNA polymerase II. We also found that the stalling and mutagenesis are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II that is involved in modulating the translocation of alkylated DNA template after nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion. Taken together, this work provides important mechanistic insights into transcriptional stalling, lesion bypass, and mutagenesis of alkylated DNA lesions. These findings will be useful for the development of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of mutagenesis induced by alkylation. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

To better understand how sequential proteolysis contributes to MERS-CoV infection, we introduced mutations that blocked the first cleavages of MERS-CoV spike (S) glycoproteins. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses trafficked past cell-surface proteases and into endosomes, whereas precleaved viruses used endosomal fusion-activating proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry. Uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may"

We present a global map of riverine fisheries, which reveals that 90% of global catch comes from river basins with above-average stress levels. We also show that freshwater fisheries provide the equivalent of all dietary animal protein for 158 million people, highlighting the critical role of rivers in providing locally sourced, low-cost protein. However, the spatial coincidence of productive fisheries and low food security underscores the high stakes for improving fishery management. Our enhanced spatial data on estimated catches can facilitate the inclusion of inland fisheries in environmental planning to protect both food security and species diversity. Our findings highlight the need to protect the world’s rivers from the impacts of human activities."

These connections suggest that this DLK-independent regeneration represents a powerful platform for gene discovery in neuronal regeneration. Moreover, we note numerous similarities between DLK-independent regeneration and lesion conditioning, a phenomenon producing robust regeneration in the mammalian CNS.

In Parkinson’s disease, this dominant network is subordinated to a disease-related pattern. Network function was assessed by quantifying the expression of resting state networks during task performance. Network deactivation was reduced in early Parkinson’s disease, and this abnormality was partially corrected by dopaminergic therapy.

Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection.

Here we show that NMDAR-Ab–induced changes in cortical microcircuitry can lead to paroxysmal EEG abnormalities. We validate a dynamic causal model of NMDAR-Ab effects on cortical microcircuitry and use this model to identify the key synaptic parameters that best explain EEG paroxysms in pediatric patients with NMDAR-Ab encephalitis. Finally, we show that NMDAR-Ab–related changes render microcircuitry critically susceptible to overt EEG paroxysms when these key parameters are changed. These findings offer mechanistic insights into circuit-level dysfunction induced by NMDAR-Ab. They also provide a framework for understanding the effects of other types of autoimmune encephalitis on brain function. This framework may be useful for the development of new treatments. (Less)"

Here, we present a multiproxy approach to investigate an abrupt climate change event that occurred during a glacial period. We show that the event was associated with a global warming and a doubling of atmospheric CO2. The warming was linked to an increase in nutrient fluxes and to a biodiversity nadir. The event was also associated with an injection of organic matter–derived carbon into the ocean, which can be linked to the development of anoxia. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms that can lead to rapid climate change and biodiversity loss. They also highlight the importance of organic matter in the Earth system and the need to better understand the role of organic matter in the past."

Despite its widespread use, the impact of certification on tropical deforestation remains unclear. We use a unique dataset of oil palm plantations to evaluate the impact of RSPO certification on deforestation and fire. We find that certification reduced deforestation by 33% from a counterfactual of 9.8 to 6.6% y−1. However, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results suggest that certification is not a silver bullet for tropical deforestation. Rather, it is a tool that can be used in combination with other policies to achieve conservation and climate goals."

Dysfunction of the exocyst complex is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. The small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and offers a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. The results also provide a deeper understanding of the function of the exocyst complex and its regulation. This study is expected to be useful for the development of new drugs for human diseases.

In many vertebrates, sex is determined by a single locus, but in others, multiple loci interact to produce more than two sexes. Here we investigate the effects of multiple interacting sex determination alleles in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii, where two alleles, one for female and one for male sex, interact to produce four possible sex classes. We find that multiple alleles can produce modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics, including genital morphology, craniofacial morphology, gastrointestinal morphology, and home tank behaviors. These results provide context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of multiple alleles in populations."

We sought to understand how Fe levels impact the retina, given that retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are also challenged by accumulations of bisretinoids. We found that intracellular Fe promotes bisretinoid oxidation and degradation. This interpretation was supported by experiments showing that Fe chelation decreased the oxidative/degradation of the bisretinoid A2E in the presence of light and reduced cell death in cell-based experiments. Moreover, light-independent oxidation and degradation of A2E by Fenton chemistry products were evidenced by the consumption of A2E, release of dicarbonyls, and generation of oxidized A2E species in cell-free assays. These findings indicate that Fe is a key factor in the photodegradation of bisretinoids. Understanding the role of Fe in the photodegradation of bisretinoids may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration.

However, the evolution of specialization is often considered a dead end, as predators become more specialized, they become less efficient and less able to adapt to environmental changes. Here we show that specialization can be maintained and even enhanced by morphological evolution. Our results suggest that the evolution of specialization is not a dead end, but rather a key process in the evolution of food webs."

The fossil record of the last 800,000 y is characterized by a suite of derived features that are absent in early hominins. This record is punctuated by the appearance of the third metacarpal styloid process, which is present in the Middle Pleistocene to recent human hand and absent in early hominins. The presence of this feature in a fossil from 1.42 Mya suggests that the complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato. This fossil also provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key derived characteristic of the modern human hand."

We also report a glycine import defect in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a cancer that is particularly sensitive to SHMT inhibition. These findings provide a metabolic rationale for SHMT inhibition in lymphoma, and a metabolic target for lymphoma therapy. They also suggest that SHMT inhibition is a promising strategy for B-cell malignancies. Finally, the pyrazolopyran scaffold is a promising lead for the development of novel SHMT inhibitors.

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants."
