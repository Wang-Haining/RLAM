The evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been enigmatic, and a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species and a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results show that the myxozoan body plan evolved from a free-living cnidarian and that the extreme degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by a reduction in genome size and gene content. These results provide insights into the molecular basis of the transition from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic cnidarian. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)."

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is largely unknown because species-level identification is prohibitively difficult with traditional methods. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large herbivores in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This study highlights the importance of using DNA metabarcoding to identify species in complex assemblages and the need to consider the potential consequences of trophic categorization.

However, the global load of plastic on the open ocean surface was estimated to be on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This discrepancy is explained by the size distribution of floating plastic debris, which points at important size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

The disease is characterized by the accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregates in affected oligodendrocytes. Several studies point to α-syn oligomerization and aggregation as a mediator of neurotoxicity in synucleinopathies including MSA. Here we show that the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 is able to limit the accumulation of α-syn in a mouse model of MSA. This effect was associated with a reduction of truncated α-syn and with neuroprotection.

A Threonine to Alanine substitution at this position was studied in three representative members of the K+-channel family. Interestingly, all of the mutant channels exhibited lack of C-type inactivation gating and an inversion of their allosteric coupling (i.e., closing of the activation gate collapses the channel’s selectivity filter). A state-dependent crystallographic study of KcsA-T75A proves that, on activation, the selectivity filter transitions from a nonconductive and deep C-type inactivated conformation to a conductive one.

The hemoglobin system is also a target of the heterochronic let-7 miRNA pathway. Here we show that the insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) is a downstream element of the let-7 miRNA pathway. We demonstrate that IGF2BP1 mediates posttranscriptional loss of the transcription factor BCL11A, which is essential for the expression of fetal hemoglobin. These results suggest a mechanism for chronoregulation of hemoglobin expression in humans. This mechanism may be relevant to the hemoglobin phenotypes observed in patients with mutations in the BCL11A gene. The results also suggest that the hemoglobin phenotypes observed in patients with mutations in the BCL11A gene may be a consequence of changes in the expression of IGF2BP1.

This resistance is mediated by activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis, which sustains sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1/stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1-mediated lipogenesis and ferroptosis resistance. In preclinical models, combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction resulted in near-complete tumor regression. These findings suggest that ferroptosis inhibition may be a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer cells with PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway mutation. This strategy may also be applicable to other cancer types with similar mechanisms of resistance.

Our findings reveal a mechanism of LCCB action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through Ca2+-dependent activation of the STIM/ORAI Ca2+ sensor proteins. Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated.

The development of new antibacterial agents is essential to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. Computational approaches are essential tools to this end since their application enables fast and early strategical decisions in the drug development process. Here, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. This study demonstrates the potential of computational drug design for the discovery of new antibiotics. It also highlights the importance of in vivo evaluation of compounds in the drug development process.

The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice, and automatically adapts to different problems.

They are also intimately related, as revealed by the study of quantum quenches. However, the entanglement dynamics is a highly nontrivial problem, which has been studied so far only for noninteracting systems. Here, we show that the entanglement dynamics in interacting systems can be understood in terms of quasiparticles, which are the elementary excitations of the interacting system. We provide a complete description of the entanglement dynamics in the space–time scaling limit, which is the relevant limit for the study of the steady state. Our results are exact for the paradigmatic Heisenberg chain. They are also applicable to other integrable models, which are relevant for the description of strongly correlated systems. Our results provide a powerful tool for the study of the entanglement dynamics in interacting systems."

We use the largest dataset of its kind to reconstruct the evolution of brain neuronal numbers across amniotes. We show that reptiles have not only small brains relative to body size but also low neuronal densities, resulting in average neuron numbers over 20 times lower than those in birds and mammals of similar body size. Amniote brain evolution is characterized by the following four major shifts in neuron–brain scaling. The most dramatic increases in brain neurons occurred independently with the appearance of birds and mammals, resulting in convergent neuron scaling in the two endothermic lineages. The other two major increases in the number of neurons happened in core land birds and anthropoid primates, which are two groups known for their cognitive prowess. Interestingly, relative brain size is associated with relative neuronal cell density in reptiles, birds, and primates but not in other mammals. This has important implications for studies using relative brain size as a proxy when looking for evolutionary drivers of animal cognition."

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal and transformed cells is more complex than previously appreciated. We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor.

However, how they sever actin filaments is not well understood. Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to study the action of ADF/cofilin in different mechanical situations. We find that ADF/cofilin enhances severing of filaments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist. A simple model, which faithfully recapitulates our experimental observations, indicates that the ADF/cofilin-induced twist enhances severing by 100-fold. We propose that this mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells.

Here, we show that, in cells experiencing such stress, the pyrophosphohydrolase RppH assumes a leading role in decapping those transcripts, preferring them as substrates over their triphosphorylated and diphosphorylated counterparts. The unique manner in which capped substrates of this kind bind to the active site of RppH positions the δ-phosphate, rather than the β-phosphate, for hydrolytic attack, generating triphosphorylated RNA as the primary product of decapping. Consequently, a second RppH-catalyzed deprotection step is required to produce the monophosphorylated 5′ terminus needed to stimulate rapid RNA degradation. The unconventional manner in which RppH recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for re"

The temperature of the surface of the Earth at the time of its formation is of particular interest because it is a fundamental parameter in the origin of life. The temperature of the Earth’s surface has been inferred from isotopic data to have decreased over geological time. However, the reliability of these temperature estimates has been questioned due to uncertainties regarding the isotopic compositions of the oceans, the effects of diagenesis and metamorphism on isotopic compositions, and the depositional environments of the rocks containing the isotopic data. Here, we present a method for determining the temperature of the Earth’s surface based on the thermostability of enzymes reconstructed from ancient organisms. The results of this study provide evidence that the temperature of the Earth’s surface decreased over geological time.

We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition.

We estimate that a phaseout of fossil-fuel-related emissions and major reductions of other anthropogenic sources can avoid an excess mortality rate of 3.61 (2.96–4.21) million per year from outdoor air pollution worldwide. This could be up to 5.55 (4.52–6.52) million per year by additionally controlling nonfossil anthropogenic sources. We also show that aerosols mask the anthropogenic rise in global temperature, and that removing pollution particles liberates 0.51(±0.03) °C and all pollution particles 0.73(±0.03) °C warming, reaching around 2 °C over North America and Northeast Asia. The steep temperature increase from removing aerosols can be moderated to about 0.36(±0.06) °C globally by the simultaneous reduction of tropospheric ozone and methane. We conclude that a rapid"

This is due to the lack of population-level genome data from this period. Here we present a genome-wide analysis of a group of 11 individuals from Bavaria, Germany, who lived mostly between 480 and 650 AD. Our data indicate that the genetic ancestry of men from this period closely resembles that of modern northern and central Europeans. However, women exhibit a very high genetic heterogeneity, including signals of genetic ancestry ranging from western Europe to East Asia. In addition, functional variants indicate that they also differed in visible characteristics. This example of female-biased migration indicates that complex demographic processes during the Early Medieval period may have contributed in an unexpected way to shape the modern European genetic landscape. Examination of the panel of functional loci also revealed that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. First, whereas MERS-CoV prefers human DPP4 over bat DPP4 as its receptor, HKU4 shows the opposite trend. Second, in the absence of exogenous proteases, both MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes mediate pseudovirus entry into bat cells, whereas only MERS-CoV spike, but not HKU4 spike, mediates pseudovirus entry into human cells. Thus, MERS-CoV, but not HKU4, has adapted to"

The stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. In S. cerevisiae, the extreme stability of the pol δ holoenzyme ensures that every nucleobase within an Okazaki fragment is faithfully duplicated before dissociation but also necessitates an active displacement mechanism for polymerase recycling and exchange. In humans, the pol δ holoenzyme is remarkably stable, but the implications of this stability on lagging strand replication are unknown. Here, we report the results of a series of kinetic assays that reveal that human pol δ maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. These results provide a mechanistic explanation for the unique properties of the human pol δ holoenzyme. They also highlight the importance of studying the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme in humans.

The hypothesis that life began with the evolution of RNA molecules is one of the most popular and widely studied theories. In vitro evolution is a powerful technique that can be used to improve the activity of RNA molecules. Here, we describe the use of in vitro evolution to improve an RNA polymerase ribozyme, which can synthesize RNA molecules from an RNA template. The improved polymerase ribozyme can synthesize a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and, in low yield, even tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins.

We connect changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities. Our results also highlight the importance of the initial appearance of neighborhoods and the role of physical proximity in urban change.

We now demonstrate that A. phagocytophilum induces ticks to express antifreeze glycoprotein (iafgp), which encodes a protein with several properties, including the ability to alter bacterial biofilm formation. IAFGP perturbs the tick gut microbiota, which influences the integrity of the peritrophic matrix and gut barrier—critical obstacles for Anaplasma colonization. Mechanistically, IAFGP binds the terminal d-alanine residue of the pentapeptide chain of bacterial peptidoglycan, resulting in altered permeability and the capacity of bacteria to form biofilms. These data elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which a human pathogen appropriates an arthropod antibacterial protein to alter the gut microbiota and more effectively colonize the vector. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of how a pathogen exploits an arthropod antibacterial protein to alter the gut microbiota and more effectively colonize the vector. This knowledge may be useful in the development of strategies to control the transmission of pathogens by vectors. (PsycInfo Database Record ("

Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals; however, we did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides.

We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action.

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete. The dual-function RNA described here is a"

Here, we introduce a deep learning algorithm that efficiently enhances antibody affinity to achieve broader and more potent neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a human antibody P36-5D2, which is effective against SARS-CoV-2 Alpha, Beta, and Gamma but not Delta. We show that our algorithm can identify CDR changes that alleviate the impact of two Omicron mutations on the epitope. These results highlight the power of our deep learning approach in antibody optimization and its potential application to engineering other protein molecules. Our optimized antibodies can potentially be developed into antibody drug candidates for current and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. This work may help to reduce the time and cost of antibody development and may contribute to the development of a new generation of antibody-based therapeutics. Our approach may also be applied to other protein molecules, such as enzymes and receptors, which are also prone to mutation and may be used to develop new therapeutics.

Current systems rely on satellite imagery, crop models, and meteorological data, but have underutilized the information provided by crop experts. We show that the USDA Crop Progress and Condition survey, which has been collecting expert assessments of crop status for decades, can be used to build a continuous and probabilistic measure of crop status. This allows us to monitor crop status and predict crop yields earlier and more accurately than official forecasts released midseason. Our results demonstrate the potential of leveraging the wisdom of the crowds to improve agricultural monitoring. This is particularly relevant in the context of climate change, where early detection of anomalies is critical to mitigate their impact. Our findings have implications for the agricultural sector, as well as for the broader field of crowdsourcing."

This mechanism is sensitive to context and serial order and can be used to bind linguistic features over time. This model provides a framework for understanding the neural basis of language processing and may help to explain the emergence of language as a uniquely human ability.

Our analysis reveals no significant differences in the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration between control and warmed plots in all biomes, with the exception of deserts and boreal forests. Thus, our data provide limited evidence of acclimation of soil respiration to experimental warming in several major biome types, contrary to the results from multiple single-site studies.

The molecular signature of the transition from autotrophy to a parasitic lifestyle is still debated. Here, we present a model of the molecular evolution of the plastid genome during the transition from autotrophy to parasitism. We show that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on the plastid genome in a stepwise manner. Our findings suggest that the molecular signature of the transition to obligate parasitism is not a single event but rather a gradual process. This model can be applied to other transitions in the history of life."

We use a high-resolution large ensemble to quantify the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the probability of occurrence of multiyear rainfall deficits in southwestern South Africa. We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% by the year 2100 under an intermediate-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5 [SSP2-4.5]) and to 80% under a high-emission scenario (SSP5-8.5). These results highlight the strong sensitivity of the drought risk in SSA to future anthropogenic emissions.

The first test explosion of a nuclear bomb, the Trinity test of 16 July 1945, resulted in the fusion of surrounding sand, the test tower, and copper transmission lines into a glassy material known as “trinitite.” Here, we report the discovery, in a sample of red trinitite, of a hitherto unknown composition of icosahedral quasicrystal, Si61Cu30Ca7Fe2. It represents the oldest extant anthropogenic quasicrystal currently known, with the distinctive property that its precise time of creation is indelibly etched in history. Like the naturally formed quasicrystals found in the Khatyrka meteorite and experimental shock syntheses of quasicrystals, the anthropogenic quasicrystals in red trinitite demonstrate that transient extreme pressure–temperature conditions are suitable for the synthesis of quasicrystals and for the discovery of new quasicrystal-forming systems.

Photosynthesis relies on these modified tetrapyrroles for the capture of solar radiation and its conversion to chemical energy. The formation of the isocyclic fifth ring, the key reaction in the biosynthesis of chlorophyll, has remained enigmatic for more than 60 y. This reaction is catalyzed by two unrelated enzymes using different chemistries. The majority of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria use O2-sensitive [4Fe-4S] cluster proteins, whereas plants, cyanobacteria, and some phototrophic bacteria possess an O2-dependent enzyme, the major catalytic component of which is a diiron protein. Plant and cyanobacterial mutants in ycf54 display impaired function of the O2-dependent enzyme, accumulating the reaction substrate. Swapping cyclases between cyanobacteria and purple phototrophic bacteria reveals three classes of the O2-dependent enzyme. These data delineate three classes of O2-dependent cyclase in chlorophototrophic organisms from higher plants to bacteria, and their evolution is discussed herein.

Our findings suggest that ASK1 in glial cells may be a promising therapeutic target for reducing neuroinflammation.

The probability that precipitation deficits are also warm has increased, and we conclude that anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of co-occurring warm–dry conditions like those that created the 2012–2014 drought. The increase in the probability of warm–dry conditions is likely to continue as global warming proceeds. The 2012–2014 drought is a stark example of the human and ecological impacts that can result from warm and dry conditions. The fact that the probability of such conditions has increased in recent decades suggests that the probability of future droughts has also increased. This conclusion is consistent with the fact that the 2012–2014 drought was the most extreme drought in California in the past century. We therefore conclude that anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of drought."

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. As an alternative approach, extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying the convergence of the targets and functions of the autism-risk genes to facilitate mapping out causal paths. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility in autism and opens up a new avenue for the development of behavioral interventions.

The results also show that individual-level variation in responsiveness to news content is considerable. This variation is associated with a number of factors, including political ideology, personality, and the country in which the participant lives.

This study emphasizes the importance of ancient viral sequences for our understanding of virus evolution and phylogenetics. It also shows that viruses have been infecting humans for a long time. This is important because it suggests that the immune system has been exposed to B19V for a long time, and that B19V may have evolved to evade the immune system for a long time. This may help explain why B19V is still a common pathogen. This study also shows that ancient viral sequences can be used to date the origin of a virus.

To better understand how MERS-CoV infects humans, we engineered MERS viruses with mutations that blocked sequential proteolysis of the spike (S) glycoproteins. These mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses trafficked past cell-surface proteases and into endosomes, whereas precleaved viruses used endosomal fusion-activating proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry. Uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant"

We find that each oncogene has somewhat different surfaceomes, but the functions of these proteins are harmonized by common biological themes including up-regulation of nutrient transporters, down-regulation of adhesion molecules and tumor suppressing phosphatases, and alteration in immune modulators. Addition of a potent MEK inhibitor that blocks MAPK signaling brings each oncogene-induced surfaceome back to a common state reflecting the strong dependence of the oncogene on the MAPK pathway to propagate signaling.

Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus using in vitro experiments. Using silent trans-complementary mutants, we then demonstrated that this interaction takes place in infected cells and is required for optimal viral replication. Disruption of this interaction did not affect the HA titer of the mutant viruses, suggesting that the same amount of viral particles was produced. However, it nonspecifically decreased the amount of viral RNA in the viral particles, resulting in an eightfold increase in empty viral particles. Competition experiments indicated that this interaction favored copackaging of the interacting viral RNA segments.

Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of the functional role of YAP/TAZ in the regulation of endothelial phenotypes and the development of atherosclerotic lesions and suggest that inhibition of YAP/TAZ activation is a promising athero-protective therapeutic strategy.

The economic and ecological costs of wildfire in the United States have risen substantially in recent decades. Although climate change has likely enabled a portion of the increase in wildfire activity, the direct role of people in increasing wildfire activity has been largely overlooked. We evaluate government records of wildfires that had to be extinguished or managed by state or federal agencies from 1992 to 2012, and examine geographic and seasonal extents of human-ignited wildfires relative to lightning-ignited wildfires. Humans have vastly expanded the spatial and seasonal “fire niche” in the coterminous United States, accounting for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. During the 21-y time period, the human-caused fire season was three times longer than the lightning-caused fire season and added an average of 40,000 wildfires per year across the United States. Human-started wildfires disproportionally occurred where fuel moisture was higher than lightning-started fires, thereby helping expand the geographic and seasonal niche of wildfire.

We connect changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities. Our results also highlight the importance of the initial appearance of neighborhoods and the role of physical proximity in urban change. Our method can be used to measure the physical dynamics of cities over time and to study the spatial dynamics of urban change. Our results also suggest that the physical appearance of neighborhoods"

We estimate that the eclipse phase for ZIKV, the time between cell infection and viral production, is most likely short (∼4 h), the median within-host basic reproductive number R0 is 10.7, the rate of viral production is rapid (&gt;25,000 virions d−1), and the lifetime of an infected cell while producing virus is ∼5 h. We also estimate that the minimum number of virions produced by an infected cell over its lifetime is ∼5,500.

However, they are also among the most threatened. The ongoing mass bleaching events are pushing coral reefs to the brink of collapse. Our study provides insights into the underlying causes of the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis. We show that the metabolic energy demand of the coral host increases during heat stress, which is compensated by the degradation of amino acids. The resulting shift from net uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont subsequently promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host. Energy limitation and altered symbiotic nutrient cycling are thus key factors in the early heat stress response, directly contributing to the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis. Interpreting the stability of the coral holobiont in light of its metabolic interactions provides a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

It regulates the absorption of nutrients, mounts immune responses, and prevents systemic infections. In all animals, the epithelium is also the site of tumorigenesis. Here, we investigate the consequences of tumorigenesis on the microbiome using a Drosophila intestinal tumor model. We show that upon loss of BMP signaling, tumors lead to aberrant activation of JNK/Mmp2 signaling, followed by intestinal barrier dysfunction and commensal imbalance. In turn, the dysbiotic microbiome triggers a regenerative response and stimulates tumor growth. We find that inhibiting JNK signaling or depletion of the microbiome restores barrier function of the intestinal epithelium, leading to a reestablishment of host–microbe homeostasis, and organismic lifespan extension. Our experiments identify a JNK-dependent feedback amplification loop between intestinal tumors and the microbiome. They also highlight the importance of controlling the activity level of JNK signaling to maintain epithelial barrier function and host–microbe homeostasis.

Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

Here, we show that striatonigral fibers originating in striosomes form highly unusual bouquet-like arborizations that target bundles of ventrally extending dopamine-containing dendrites and clusters of their parent nigral cell bodies. These clustered cell bodies in turn project to the striatum as part of the classic nigrostriatal pathway. Thus, these striosome–dendron bouquets likely represent subsystems with the nigro–striato–nigral loop that are affected in human disorders including Parkinson’s disease. Given evidence that striosomes receive input from cortical regions related to the control of mood and motivation and that they link functionally to reinforcement and decision-making, the striosome–dendron bouquets could be critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease.

Using this model, we identify the key synaptic parameters that best explain EEG paroxysms in pediatric patients with NMDAR-Ab encephalitis. Finally, we use the mouse model to show that NMDAR-Ab–related changes render microcircuitry critically susceptible to overt EEG paroxysms when these key parameters are changed, even though the same parameter fluctuations are tolerated in the in silico model of the control condition.

In albino mice with reduced Fe levels, intracellular Fe promoted bisretinoid oxidation and degradation. These findings indicate that intracellular Fe promotes bisretinoid oxidation and degradation. This interpretation was supported by experiments showing that Fe chelation decreased the oxidative/degradation of the bisretinoid A2E in the presence of light and reduced cell death in cell-based experiments. Moreover, light-independent oxidation and degradation of A2E by Fenton chemistry products were evidenced by the consumption of A2E, release of dicarbonyls, and generation of oxidized A2E species in cell-free assays.

We show that cancer cells are particularly sensitive to inhibition of the folate one-carbon unit metabolic enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase. We also show that cancer cells have unique metabolic vulnerabilities that can be exploited to treat cancer. Thus, this study identifies a metabolic vulnerability of cancer cells that can be exploited to treat cancer. This study also identifies a new class of small-molecule cancer therapeutics. The study also provides a proof-of-concept for the use of one-carbon unit metabolic inhibitors as a cancer therapy.

The results have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. The results also highlight the need to consider the role of natural landscapes in meeting nutrition goals, particularly in rural areas of low- and middle-income countries. The study also provides a methodological contribution in that it demonstrates the use of a causal modeling approach to test the impact of deforestation on people’s diets. The approach can be used to test the impact of other environmental factors on people’s diets. The study also provides a demonstration of the use of covariate balancing generalized propensity score (CBGPS) weighting, which is a useful approach for causal inference in observational studies.

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We hypothesize that the paradox of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction is a result of unconstrained roaming of sauropods, which would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles. This suggests that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This study highlights the need for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. It also suggests that the use of fixed foraging trails may be a viable strategy for reducing subsoil compaction in modern agriculture. This strategy could be applied to mitigate the effects of subsoil compaction in modern agriculture and to reduce the risk of subsoil compaction in future agricultural systems. This would be of particular importance in the context of climate change, which is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events"
