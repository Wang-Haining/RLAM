To understand the nature of this transition, we compared the genomes of two distantly related species, Kudoa iwatai and Myxobolus cerebralis, to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results show that the myxozoan body plan is the result of extreme degeneration of the cnidarian body plan. In addition, we show that the myxozoan genome is one of the smallest reported in animals. This reduction in genome size is likely to have been accompanied by a reduction in gene content, and our results suggest that the myxozoan genome is also depleted in genes involved in development and cell–cell communication. These results provide insights into the molecular basis of the extreme reduction of the myxozoan body plan. (Show more)"

The virus has been shown to evade the host innate immune response by blocking interferon (IFN)-mediated signaling. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes. We found that SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This mechanism may be a common strategy used by other viruses to evade the host innate immune response. This study provides a"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. Sperm cells are quiescent in the male reproductive system due to Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1 channels, but become active once introduced into the low-Zn2+-concentration environment of the female reproductive tract. How Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide"

We find that the variability of maize yields will increase substantially in most of the world’s maize-producing countries. This increase in variability will increase the probability that the world’s major maize-exporting countries will simultaneously experience production losses greater than 10% in any given year. Our results underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance.

However, the extent to which different species partition food resources is largely unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa in the field. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammal species in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammal assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results highlight the importance of diet composition in determining the extent to which different species partition food resources.

We present here an in vivo proof of concept of the ability of the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 to mitigate α-syn pathology and to mediate neuroprotection in a mouse model of MSA.

Here we show that anxiety, a personality trait, directly influences social dominance in male outbred rats and identify an important mediating role for mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens. High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low-anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as decreased ATP and increased ROS production in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious individuals.

The underlying molecular mechanisms of hypertension-induced heart failure are not fully understood. Here, we show that the three major classes of L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs) activate STIM1, which in turn activates ORAI channels. LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM1-mediated activation of ORAI channels. Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. Our findings unravel a mechanism of LCCBs action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM1-mediated activation of ORAI. This study provides a rationale for the use of LCCBs in the treatment of hypertension. Our findings may also lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. (Show more)"

The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice, and automatically adapts to different problems. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data."

We have shown that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. These data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This study may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies. (Read more)"

ADF/cofilin are key regulators of cell shape and motility. However, how it does so remains unclear. Here, we show that ADF/cofilin can sever actin filaments in a mechanical context, which is relevant to cells. We show that the mechanical torque that is induced by the presence of two anchoring points enhances severing by an order of magnitude. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of ADF/cofilin’s function in cells. They also provide a general framework for understanding the action of other proteins that are involved in the assembly and disassembly of actin filaments. This framework can be used to design new drugs that target actin dynamics."

The disease is characterized by chronic inflammation, which is most often attributed to the presence of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and cell death. However, we show that soluble and oligomeric Aβ are the most toxic amyloid species within the brain and are responsible for the initiation of an inflammatory response in neurons. This neuron-specific inflammatory reaction correlates with the extent of microglial activation and mobilization, even in the absence of extracellular plaques and cell death. We demonstrate within disease-vulnerable regions of the human brain that a neuron-specific inflammatory response may precede the formation of Aβ plaque and tau tangle deposits. Thus, we reveal the Aβ-burdened neuron as a primary proinflammatory agent, implicating the intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ as a significant immunological component in the AD pathogenesis. This study provides a novel insight into the disease mechanism and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc."

Here, we show that, in cells experiencing stress, the RNA pyrophosphohydrolase RppH, which is known to prefer to remove the terminal phosphate of diphosphorylated RNAs over the terminal phosphate of the triphosphorylated RNA, is the predominant enzyme responsible for decapping Np4-capped RNAs. This enzyme recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5′ termini, resulting in a one-nucleotide shift in substrate specificity. The unconventional manner in which RppH recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress.

This instrument is capable of measuring aerosol and cloud properties with high spatial and temporal resolution.

In temperate regions, seasonal outbreaks of influenza virus are associated with decreases in ambient humidity. However, the impact of humidity on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that mice housed in low humidity are more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the impact of dry air on host defense and disease outcome during influenza virus infection.

The auditory organs of animals are diverse in structure and function, but all are part of the body of the animal. Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. The web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to capture the sound-induced air particle movements that approach the maximum physical efficiency better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself. The spider also enables the flexibility to functionally adjust and regularly regenerate its external ""eardrum"" according to its needs. The outsourcing and supersizing of auditory function in spiders provide unique features for studying extended and regenerative sensing and designing novel acoustic flow detectors for precise fluid dynamic measurement and manipulation.

We show that it can avoid an excess mortality rate of 3.61 million per year from outdoor air pollution worldwide. This could be up to 5.55 million per year by additionally controlling nonfossil anthropogenic sources. Globally, fossil-fuel-related emissions account for about 65% of the excess mortality, and 70% of the climate cooling by anthropogenic aerosols. The chemical influence of air pollution on aeolian dust contributes to the aerosol cooling. Since aerosols mask the anthropogenic rise in global temperature, removing fossil-fuel-generated particles liberates 0.51 °C and all pollution particles 0.73 °C, thus limiting global warming to 2 °C.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how HKU4 and HKU5 transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions. Our findings provide insights into the molecular basis of MERS-CoV pathogenesis and the evolution of bat coronaviruses. They also provide a molecular basis for"

The RNA encodes a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC) that increases the activity of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a key enzyme in the metabolism of glycerol. We found that the RNA also represses two genes, cadA and galE, by base pairing with the RNA. The base pairing and AzuC translation compete for the same ribosome binding site, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete. This is an example of a dual-function RNA.

We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

These mutations are linked to the formation of intracellular inclusion bodies that are characteristic of different neuropathological subtypes of the disease. The proteins that form inclusions are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, but are themselves supersaturated in motor neurons. This suggests that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. This study provides a molecular explanation for the formation of inclusion bodies in ALS. It also provides a rationale for the use of small molecules that stabilize proteins in the metastable state. Such molecules could be used to treat ALS. (Read more)"

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas the more rigid uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into"

This, in turn, promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host.

It is thought to create a map of local space, based on the activity of grid, head-direction (HD), border, and object-vector (OV) cells. How these cell types are organized anatomically is debated. Here, we used a portable two-photon microscope to record the activity of neurons in MEC during free-moving behavior. We found that grid cells are strongly clustered, while border, HD, and OV cells tend to intermingle. These data suggest that grid cells might be largely distinct from those of other cell types. Our findings could have implications for understanding the organization of the MEC and its role in memory. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Here we show that the third metacarpal styloid process, a key derived feature of the modern human hand, was present ∼1.42 My old in an East African hominin from Kaitio, West Turkana, Kenya. This fossil thus provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key shared derived characteristic of modern human and Neandertal hand morphology and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato.

This alarming trend calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction.
