In this work, we report the structure of ice II hydrate, which is a new phase of water. The structure is determined by in situ neutron diffraction at 480 MPa and temperatures ranging from 260 to 70 K. The guest atoms are enclathrated in the water channels, and the guest–host interactions are weak. The structure is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. This work provides a new perspective on the structure of ice II and its stability at high pressure. It also provides a new route to study the structure of ice II by in situ high-pressure diffraction. This work is expected to be of interest to researchers in the fields of high-pressure science, hydrate science, and ice science. (Show more)"

The definition is based on a small number of axioms that are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. The axioms are similar to those of classical mechanics and classical field theory. The definition is intended to be a foundation for a reconstruction program for quantum theory. The program is based on the idea that the axioms of quantum theory are the minimal set of axioms that are consistent with the laws of physics.

The evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, and a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we present a genomic and transcriptomic analysis of two myxozoan species and a cnidarian parasite, and we show that the Myxozoa are a sister group to the cnidarians. We also show that the myxozoan body plan was greatly reduced in terms of both genome size and gene content. Our results provide insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. This work will be of interest to a broad range of researchers interested in the evolution of parasites and parasites of parasites."

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes. Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the host immune response and may help in the development of new strategies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1, but the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

However, despite decades of research, we still do not know how diverse LMH assemblages partition food resources. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant LMH species in semiarid African savanna. Our results show that LMH partition food resources in a variety of ways, including differential consumption of grasses versus nongrasses and spatiotemporal stratification in use of different parts of the same plant. Nonetheless, LMH diversity was not linked to the diversity of the food resources available, suggesting that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results highlight the need to consider the species-level diversity of LMH when studying their interactions with plants and biodiversity. This is important for understanding the drivers of biodiversity in African savanna and beyond."

Our results point at the importance of the size distribution of the plastic debris in the ocean, and the need for further studies on the fate of the missing plastic debris."

The best candidate was tested in vitro and in vivo, and showed activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. This approach can be used to design new antibiotics for other targets and for other pathogens. This work is expected to contribute to the development of new antibiotics. (Show more)"

The inner core is a paradox because it is formed at a temperature that is too high for the stable, hexagonal, close-packed phase of iron to be formed, and it is not old enough for the stable, body-centered, cubic phase to have formed. We show that the stable, body-centered, cubic phase has a much higher nucleation rate than does the stable, hexagonal, close-packed phase, and thus the body-centered phase is the first step of the inner core formation.

We find that ADF binds to filaments more efficiently in regions of high curvature, but that tension has no effect on binding. Surprisingly, we also find that filament segments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist, experience a mechanical torque upon ADF binding. We propose that this torque dramatically enhances severing, which is critical to boost ADF’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells.

The settlement history of Madagascar is still debated, and we used a grid-based approach to sample the genomic diversity across the island. We find that the Malagasy population is a mixture of Bantu and Austronesian populations, with a limited contribution of European and Middle Eastern origin. The distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. Our results provide a better understanding of the settlement history of Madagascar and the genetic consequences of the human colonization of the island. This is important for the conservation of the unique biodiversity of Madagascar. It also provides a framework for the study of the genetic consequences of human colonization in general."

Here, we introduce a new instrument, the dual-field-of-view high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL), to overcome this conundrum. The HSRL is capable of simultaneously profiling aerosol and water cloud properties, especially water cloud microphysical properties. This instrument is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI. The observations obtained from the HSRL constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI process. This technique is expected to be a significant contributor to the ACI investigations. Thus, the results of this study are expected to have a significant impact on the climate science.

Our results provide a detailed quantitative picture of reporting about lethal violence and its gendered nature. Our method offers a flexible and broadly applicable approach to model topics in text data. This approach can be applied to many domains, including social media, news, and medical records. We believe that this approach will be of interest to researchers in many fields."

This epidemic marked the start of the second plague pandemic, which lasted in Europe until the early 19th century. This pandemic is generally understood as the consequence of a singular introduction of Yersinia pestis, after which the disease established itself in European rodents over four centuries. To locate these putative plague reservoirs, we studied the climate fluctuations that preceded regional plague epidemics, based on a dataset of 7,711 georeferenced historical plague outbreaks and 15 annually resolved tree-ring records from Europe and Asia. We provide evidence for repeated climate-driven reintroductions of the bacterium into European harbors from reservoirs in Asia, with a delay of 15 ± 1 y. Our analysis finds no support for the existence of permanent plague reservoirs in medieval Europe. This study provides a new perspective on the history of the plague, and on the mechanisms of its spread. It also highlights the importance of climate change in the spread of this disease."

We found that the protein interacts with a membrane-bound enzyme and that the RNA interferes with the enzyme’s activity. The RNA also interferes with the ability of the protein to repress genes involved in carbon utilization. These results demonstrate that the translation and base-pairing functions of the RNA compete.

This lack of evidence for acclimation of soil respiration to experimental warming in major biome types, coupled with the consistent decrease in temperature sensitivity at higher temperatures, suggests that soil carbon dynamics may be more variable in colder regions, with colder climates being considerably more responsive to increased ambient temperatures compared with warmer regions.

In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

The band structures of the 2D photonic crystals are predicted to produce unconventional atom–light interaction behaviors, including anisotropic emission, suppressed spontaneous decay, and photon-mediated atom–atom interactions controlled by the position of the atomic array relative to the photonic crystal. The device configuration also enables application of optical tweezers for controlled placement of atoms. Devices can be fabricated reliably from a 200-nm silicon nitride device layer using a lithography-based process, producing predicted optical properties in transmission and reflection measurements. These 2D photonic crystal devices can be readily deployed to experiments for many-body physics with neutral atoms and engineering of exotic quantum matter. We believe that the 2D photonic crystal system is a promising platform for exploring a wide range of novel quantum phenomena. This work is expected to have a broad impact on the field of quantum optics and atom optics. It will also be of interest to the physics community at large."

To better understand how sequential proteolysis contributes to infection, we introduced mutations that blocked the first cleavages of MERS-CoV spike (S) proteins. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Therefore, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence. This study provides insights into the mechanisms of viral infection and may be relevant to the development of therapeutic strategies for MERS-CoV."

We asked pairs of friends and strangers to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Finally, we demonstrate that this signal is used by third-party listeners as a heuristic of how well people are connected: Conversations with faster response times were perceived as more connected than the same conversations with slower response times. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

These findings provide insights into the mechanism of SAN function and may lead to the development of novel therapies for heart failure. (Show more)"

However, the nutrient loads from small tributaries were also high for their size, and the nutrients were more likely to be in the form of dissolved inorganic nutrients, which are more bioavailable to algae.

Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results suggest that certification may be a useful tool for reducing deforestation in oil palm, but that it is not a panacea for tropical deforestation."

The alarming trend of subsoil compaction calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This study highlights the importance of considering the ecological context of the mechanization process in order to design sustainable agricultural systems. It also suggests that the study of past ecosystems can provide valuable insights for the design of modern agricultural systems."
