Although the evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we compare the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. These results provide insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Show more)"

Zinc is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of zinc inhibition of the Hv1 channel. We find that zinc binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the zinc-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how zinc inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant African LMH species. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers. Grass consumption inferred from mean sequence relative read abundance ranged from &gt;99% (plains zebra) to &lt;1% (dik-dik). Grass RRA was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of % grass consumption, indicating that RRA conveys reliable quantitative information about consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of size-matched grazers—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.

Our observations of the size distribution of floating plastic debris point at important size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale.

We found that cancer cells with mutations in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway are resistant to ferroptosis, a form of regulated necrosis that is regulated by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. We also found that this resistance is mediated by a mechanism involving the activation of the mTORC1 signaling axis and the induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. Finally, we showed that the combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction is effective in preclinical models of cancer.

Our findings reveal a mechanism of LCCBs action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through the activation of the store-operated Ca2+ channel. Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of the store-operated Ca2+ channel are elevated. This study provides a rationale for the use of LCCBs in the treatment of hypertension. (PsycINFO Database Record"

We show that the NWFP halted the decline of early-seral bird populations, but the opposite occurred for older-forest–associated species. This is partly because of the loss of older forests to fire on federal land and continued clearcutting elsewhere. The NWFP has been effective in halting the decline of early-seral bird populations, but the policy has failed to reverse the decline of older-forest–associated species. This failure is partly due to the creation of early-seral ecosystems on federal land, which may impede the development of older-forest structure.

The development of new antibiotics is a major challenge, and computational approaches are essential tools to this end. We present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. The predicted best candidate is more active than telithromycin, a clinically used antibiotic, and is up to 56 times more active than telithromycin. The design strategy presented here can be applied to other antibiotic classes. This work is expected to contribute to the development of new antibiotics.

We show that the Osmium isotope composition of the YDB samples is consistent with terrestrial sources.

However, in contrast to congenital deficiency, this was not fatal. CTLA-4 deletion induced preferential expansion of CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells. However, T cells from CTLA-4–deficient inducible KO mice were able to adoptively transfer the diseases into T cell-deficient mice.

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal and transformed cells is more complex than previously appreciated. We have shown that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1 may act as a tumor suppressor in some settings. These data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This study also provides a mechanistic basis for the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers. This may have implications for the use of TRAP1 inhibitors in cancer therapy. (PsycINFO Database Record"

They are dynamic polymers that can be assembled and disassembled. The disassembly process is controlled by the actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin family of proteins. These proteins are the main regulators of actin filament disassembly. However, how they do so remains unclear. Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to study the action of ADF/cofilin in different mechanical situations. We find that mechanical tension has no effect on ADF/cofilin binding and weakly enhances severing. Remarkably, we observe that filament segments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist, experience a mechanical torque upon cofilin binding. We propose that this ADF/cofilin-induced torque increases the severing rate constant 100-fold. A consequence of this mechanism is that cross-linked filament networks are severed far more efficiently than nonconnected filaments. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. This work provides a new understanding of the action of ADF/cofilin and its role in cell mechanics"

They regulate ion flow by opening and closing their pore gates. Ion channels commonly possess two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also found that the BK channel C-type inactivation is state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. Our findings may help to understand the BK channel’s unique properties and may provide a basis for the development of new drugs. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition.

Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is outsourced to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. The spider’s web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to capture the sound-induced air particle movements that approach the maximum physical efficiency better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself.

We also identify the red pigment in the nectar of hummingbird-visited Jaltomata herrerae, providing evidence for convergent evolution of this trait. Our findings suggest that the red color of nectar is a widespread and convergently evolved trait that is likely to be driven by a small number of compounds. This work provides insight into the evolution of a key trait that is essential for plant reproduction. (Less)"

In addition, we show that women with artificial skull deformations had a genetic ancestry that was very different from that of other women. This example of female-biased migration indicates that complex demographic processes during the Early Medieval period may have contributed in an unexpected way to shape the modern European genetic landscape."

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how HKU4 and HKU5 transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions. Our findings are important for understanding the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and for developing effective countermeasures against future zoonotic outbreaks. This article is protected by copyright.

In this study, we developed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. We found that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with the PCNA sliding clamp while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This study provides a unique perspective on the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme and its implications for DNA replication.

The Black and Latino populations are estimated to experience declines in life expectancy at birth of 2.10 and 3.05 y, respectively, both of which are several times the 0.68-y reduction for Whites. Latinos, who have consistently experienced lower mortality than Whites, would see their more than 3-y survival advantage reduced to less than 1 y.

However, recent and predicted future reductions in fire activity may enhance land carbon uptake and corresponding to offsetting ∼5 to 10 y of global CO2 emissions at today’s levels. This potentially reduces warming by up to 0.11 °C by 2100.

We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells.

Therefore, it is difficult to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility.

We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting.

We demonstrate that the release of aggregates requires N-ethylmalemide–sensitive fusion protein 1, indicating that active release and uptake of aggregates are important elements of spreading and disease progression.

To understand how MERS-CoV infects human cells, we engineered viruses with mutations that blocked sequential proteolysis of the spike (S) glycoprotein. These mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence. These findings may also be relevant to other coronaviruses. © 2017 International Society for Infectious Diseases. All rights reserved."

This interaction is required for optimal viral replication and nonspecifically decreases the amount of viral RNA in the viral particles. Our results indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions. The lack of conservation of these interactions might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses.

However, the role of FSIP1 in the progression and drug sensitivity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

Here, we used a portable two-photon microscope to examine the topographic arrangement of neurons in the superficial layers of MEC and adjacent parasubiculum during unrestrained behavior. We found that grid cells exhibited strong coupling among themselves but weaker links to other cell types. These data suggest that grid cell networks might be largely distinct from those of border, HD, and OV cells. Our results provide a detailed view of the organization of the MEC and its connections with other brain regions. They also provide a framework for understanding the formation of the spatial map in the brain. This framework can be applied to other brain areas.

But how do we know when two people are connected? We asked people to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. We found that the speed with which people responded to each other was a robust predictor of how connected they felt. People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.” This is a fundamental question in social science, and our findings provide a new way to measure it.

We show that STIM1 is expressed in the specialized cardiomyocytes of the SAN, and that its deletion leads to depletion of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ stores of SAN cells and to a reduction in heart rate. Moreover, we show that STIM1 regulates SAN function by influencing the activity of Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane of SAN cells.

This study shows that deforestation can have a negative impact on people’s diets, particularly in rural areas of low- and middle-income countries. The results have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. This study also highlights the importance of using a modeling approach to test causal hypotheses, which can be used to test hypotheses in other fields of research. The results are also relevant for the broader field of nutrition and health research, which has largely ignored the role of natural landscapes in meeting nutrition goals. (Less)"

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the largest sauropods had the"
