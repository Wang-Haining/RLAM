In this work, we report the structure of a hydrate, which is a mixture of water and neon. The structure of the hydrate is different from that of ice II, and the guest atoms are enclathrated in the host lattices. The structure of the hydrate is also different from that of the other hydrates, which are mixtures of water and other elements."

We provide a set of axioms for a category of functions between Hilbert spaces that are categorical and therefore can be used as a foundation. The axioms are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure.

Although the evolutionary origin of the myxozoan body plan has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we present the first comparative analysis of the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species, Kudoa iwatai and Myxobolus cerebralis, and compare these to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. These results have implications for understanding the origin of parasitism and the evolution of the animal kingdom. (Show more)"

The virus has been shown to evade the host immune response by blocking the nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are essential for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). In this study, we show that the viral accessory protein Orf6 is responsible for this evasion mechanism. We found that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1, a protein complex that mediates nuclear import of cargo proteins. We also show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its ability to block nuclear import of ISG mRNA. Our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This mechanism may be exploited by other viruses and may be a target for the development of new antiviral strategies. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of the proton channel. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the channel. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on the channel: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of the channel, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of the channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits the channel will further our understanding of the channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for the channel.

We show that DNA metabarcoding can be used to quantify the degree to which different species partition food resources at the species level. We also show that the degree of overlap in food-resource use between species is strongly related to the degree of overlap in the species’ resource use. These results suggest that the coexistence of species with different feeding preferences is not only a fundamental challenge in ecology but also that the degree of overlap in food-resource use between species is a key determinant of coexistence.

Our observations of the size distribution of floating plastic debris point at important size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered.

Computational approaches are essential tools to this end since their application enables fast and early strategical decisions in the drug development process. Here, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

Here, we show that ADF can induce the depolymerization of actin filaments under physiological conditions, such as when they are connected to each other and under mechanical stress. We propose a mechanochemical model that explains our observations. Our findings have implications for our understanding of the ADF mechanism and for the design of new drugs. They also have implications for our understanding of the ADF mechanism and for the design of new drugs."

This study shows that the evolution of an aquatic lifestyle is driving three of the four extant aquatic mammal clades toward a size attractor at ∼500 kg. The existence of this body size attractor and the relatively rapid selection toward, and limited deviation from, this attractor rule out most hypothesized drivers of size increase. These three independent body size increases and a shared aquatic optimum size are consistent with control by differences in the scaling of energetic intake and cost functions with body size between the terrestrial and aquatic realms. Under this energetic model, thermoregulatory costs constrain minimum size, whereas limitations on feeding efficiency constrain maximum size. Rather than being released from size pressures, water-dwelling mammals are driven and confined to larger body sizes by the strict energetic demands of the aquatic medium. (Less)"

The observations show that the aerosol loading increased the droplet number concentration and decreased the droplet effective radius, which is consistent with the expectation. However, the aerosol-induced increase in cloud water was canceled out by enhanced evaporation, which is a new finding. This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations obtained from the HSRL constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI. View Project"

This pattern of activity is consistent with a merge operation that applies equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases. This process may be important for language comprehension and may be disrupted in language disorders. Our findings may also have implications for the neurobiology of language acquisition.

We demonstrate that mNGS can be used to detect undifferentiated febrile illness in a periurban population in Cambodia. We also show that mNGS can be used to identify the presence of undifferentiated febrile illness in a population, and that it can be used to identify the presence of undifferentiated febrile illness in a population, and that it can be used to identify the presence of a specific pathogen in a population. This study highlights the potential of mNGS to be used as a surveillance tool in resource-scarce settings. This will allow for the early detection of emerging pathogens and the deployment of rapid public health response.

In humans, pol δ is the only polymerase that is responsible for this process. In S. cerevisiae, the stability of pol δ is essential for every aspect of lagging strand replication. However, the stability of the human pol δ holoenzyme is unknown. We designed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. Surprisingly, the results indicate that human pol δ maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This study provides a unique insight into the stability of the human pol δ holoenzyme and its implications for DNA replication. It also provides a unique model for studying the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme in humans. This model could be used to study the role of pol δ in human diseases. It could also be used to study the role of PCNA in human diseases."

Neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

This glycan is catabolized by the symbiont, which is thereby able to maintain a healthy population level and to produce light at night.

We show here that monoclonal antibodies targeting the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML.

MTX selectively inhibits the epoxide hydrolase function of leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) to inhibit LTA4 hydrolysis and the generation of potent lipid chemoattractant for host defense against infection. MTX potently inhibits proinflammatory proteases to induce immune tolerance and maintain high stability. In mouse models, influenza A virus (IAV) infection and pathogenicity were exacerbated by MTX but were reversed by interfering with the effects of MTX on LTA4H or exogenous LTB4 administration. This study provides deeper insight into immunologically privileged sites for microbial community residence in bats and supports the therapeutic potential of targeting MTX-LTA4H. Our findings may help to elucidate the mechanisms of virus spillover from bats and provide a new strategy for the development of antiviral drugs. This article is protected by copyright.

The disease is caused by a variety of genetic mutations in proteins that are highly aggregation-prone, and the inclusions formed by these proteins are characteristic of the neuropathology of the disease. Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions in the brain and spinal cord are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, but are themselves supersaturated in motor neurons. We propose that the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in ALS results from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. This study provides a new perspective on the neuropathology of ALS and suggests a mechanism for the formation of inclusions in this disease. (Show more)"

We found that the three regioisomeric EtdT lesions induce distinct pol II stalling profiles. Intriguingly, pol II stalling at O2-EtdT and N3-EtdT sites is exacerbated by TFIIS-stimulated proofreading activity. Assessment for the impact of the EtdT lesions on individual fidelity checkpoints provided further mechanistic insights, where the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints.

MERS-CoV infects human cells only after its spike (S) proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. Here, we show that the first cleavages are required for MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but have little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence. Our findings may help to explain why MERS-CoV causes severe disease in humans, but not in other animal species. (Show more)"

Their genome is segmented into eight fragments, which offers evolutionary advantages but complicates genomic packaging. The existence of a selective packaging mechanism, in which one copy of each viral RNA is specifically packaged into each virion, is suspected, but its molecular details remain unknown. Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus. This interaction takes place in infected cells and is required for optimal viral replication. Disruption of this interaction resulted in an eightfold increase in empty viral particles. This interaction is not widely conserved among influenza A viruses, suggesting that genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses is limited. Our results provide insights into the molecular details of the selective packaging mechanism of the influenza A virus. They also provide a molecular basis for the evolution of the influenza A virus.

Here we demonstrate that the activation of Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) by disturbed flow is a key event in the development of atheroprone phenotypes and the progression of atherosclerotic lesions. Our results suggest that inhibition of YAP/TAZ activation is a promising strategy for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis. This strategy may be applicable to other diseases that are regulated by YAP/TAZ. The study also provides a mechanistic understanding of the functional role of YAP/TAZ in the regulation of disturbed flow-induced vascular homeostasis.

However, the role of humans in increasing wildfire activity is largely overlooked. We show that humans have vastly expanded the spatial and seasonal “fire niche” in the United States, accounting for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. Human-caused wildfires disproportionally occurred where fuel moisture was higher than lightning-started fires, thereby helping expand the geographic and seasonal niche of wildfire. Actions to raise awareness and increase management in regions prone to human-started wildfires should be a focus of United States policy to reduce fire risk and associated hazards. Our findings highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of the role of humans in shaping the fire regime.

Neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

Here we present a mathematical analysis of the within-host dynamics of plasma ZIKV burden in a nonhuman primate model, allowing for characterization of the growth and clearance of ZIKV within individual macaques. We estimate that the eclipse phase for ZIKV, the time between cell infection and viral production, is most likely short (∼4 h), the median within-host basic reproductive number R0 is 10.7, the rate of viral production is rapid (&gt;25,000 virions d−1), and the lifetime of an infected cell while producing virus is ∼5 h.

We show that the catabolism of amino acids during heat stress is a key process in the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis. This process is driven by altered nutrient cycling, which in turn is a direct consequence of the heat stress-induced metabolic demand of the coral host.

Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. Our findings have important implications for our ability to predict the impacts of climate change on ecosystem functioning. (Abridged)"

We found that grid cells, which are the main cell type in the MEC, are spatially organized and form a network. These data provide a detailed view of the organization of the MEC and its relationship with other brain regions.

But how do we know when two people are connected? We asked people to talk with each other and rated the felt connection. We found that the speed with which people responded to each other was a robust predictor of felt connection. Within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.” This is a fundamental question in social science, and our findings provide a simple answer.

The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants.
