Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1 channels, but the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered.

To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations.

The proposed architecture is based on a simple idea: use dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connect all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice. We compare results of the proposed architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data. We believe that this architecture will be useful for many applications in computer vision and image processing."

We have found that APOE is important for the normal function of astrocytes, which is to remove synapses that are no longer functional. APOE is also important for the normal rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes.

Here, we show that the brain’s activity varies with each successive word in a sentence but suddenly when words can be merged into a phrase. Our results suggest that the brain performs a merge operation that applies equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity. More generally, our findings provide evidence for a neural implementation of a left-corner parser of the incoming language stream. They also suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases."

This work represents a key milestone toward the development of a synthetic plant-controlled symbiosis in which the bacteria fix nitrogen only when in contact with the desired host plant and are prevented from interaction with nontarget plant species.

Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. We find that the wispy, wheel-shaped orb web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to capture the sound-induced air particle movements that approach the maximum physical efficiency better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By sensing the motion of web threads, the spider remotely detects and localizes the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave, such as those emitted by approaching prey or predators. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,00"

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, HM predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. HM was associated with less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors. The findings highlight the importance of psychological examinations of masculinity as a cultural ideology to understand how men’s and women’s endorsement of HM legitimizes patriarchal dominance and reinforces gender, race, and class-based hierarchies.

In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. Our results suggest that behavioral inflexibility is a common feature of autism-risk genes and that the ability to forget is a critical component of behavioral flexibility. These findings may facilitate the identification of the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms. (Show more)"

These effects, except for the increased expression of CRF itself, could all be blocked by pretreatment with an antagonist of the CRF receptor CRFR1. We also show that, in cultured primary astrocytes, CRF, acting through CRFR1, triggers signaling of cAMP/PKA, intracellular Ca2+, and PKCε, and that the up-regulated cAMP/PKA signaling contributes to the phosphorylation and expression of AQP4 to enhance water influx into astrocytes and produces an up-regulation of ET-1 expression.

But how do we know when two people are connected? We asked pairs of friends and strangers to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

We show that the activity of a small number of neurons can be used to store information about the past and the future. This mechanism is based on the adaptive changes in the excitability of a small number of neurons. We show that this mechanism is sensitive to context and serial order which makes it suitable for temporal integration in sequence processing within the language domain.

The results have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. The results also highlight the importance of considering the role of natural landscapes in meeting nutrition goals."

We show that the increase in vehicle weight has led to the propagation of compaction into deeper soil layers, and that the current level of compaction is now at risk of compromising the ecological functioning of the soil. We also show that the total weight of modern farm machinery is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, suggesting that unconstrained roaming of these giants would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles. Our results highlight the need for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. This could lead to a more sustainable use of agricultural land and a better understanding of the ecological strategies of prehistoric giants. View Full-Text"
