In this work, we report the structure of ice II-structured hydrate, which is a new phase of water. The structure is determined by in situ neutron diffraction at 480 MPa and temperatures ranging from 260 to 70 K. The guest atoms are enclathrated in water molecules to form ice II-structured hydrates. The guest atoms have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. This work provides a new route to study the structure of ice II, which is of great importance to the understanding of the properties of water under high-pressure conditions. It also provides a new route to study the structure of ice II-structured hydrates. The latter is of great importance to the understanding of the properties of water under high-pressure conditions. It is also of great importance to the development of technologies such as deep-sea exploration, oil and gas exploitation, and nuclear waste disposal. (Show more)"

The definition is purely categorical and does not presuppose any analytical structure. It is based on a small number of axioms that are satisfied by the category of Hilbert spaces and linear operators on them. The definition is therefore applicable to any consistent formulation of quantum theory. We show that the definition is equivalent to the standard axiomatizations of quantum theory in terms of states, observables, and measurements. We also show that the definition is equivalent to the standard axiomatizations in terms of the density matrix and Hermitian operators. This provides a new proof of the equivalence of the density matrix formulation with the operator-algebraic formulation."

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes. Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the host immune response and may help in the development of new antiviral strategies. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1 channels, but the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is largely unknown because of the difficulty of quantifying diet composition at the species level. We show that DNA metabarcoding can be used to quantify diet composition at the species level, and that this approach can be used to show that the degree of diet overlap is not always a good predictor of the degree of dietary similarity. Our results suggest that the degree of diet overlap may be less important than previously thought in determining coexistence in LMH assemblages. This finding has important implications for our understanding of the role of LMH in shaping ecosystems. Our results also suggest that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This is an important finding for the conservation of LMH and their ecosystems."

Our observations of the size distribution of floating plastic debris point at important size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low-anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as decreased ATP and increased ROS production in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals.

We show that the NWFP halted the decline of early-seral bird populations, but the decline of older-forest–associated species accelerated. The NWFP was not effective in halting the decline of older-forest–associated bird populations because of the continued loss of older forests due to fire and clearcutting elsewhere. The NWFP is a unique opportunity to evaluate the influence of policy, and our findings highlight the need to continue to prioritize older forests under the plan."

The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice.

The actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin family is the central regulator of actin filament disassembly. However, how it does so in a physiological context, where filaments are interconnected and under mechanical stress, remains unclear. Here, we monitor and quantify the action of ADF/cofilin in different mechanical situations by using single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques, coupled to microfluidics. We find that local curvature favors severing, while tension surprisingly has no effect on cofilin binding and weakly enhances severing. Remarkably, we observe that filament segments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist, experience a mechanical torque upon cofilin binding. We propose that this ADF/cofilin-induced torque increases the severing rate constant 100-fold. A consequence of this mechanism, which we verify experimentally, is that cross-linked filament networks are severed by cofilin far more efficiently than nonconnected filaments."

We also found that the settlement of Madagascar happened recently, but the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island suggests that the settlement was not homogeneous. Finally, we found that a few centuries are sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations.

This instrument, verified by the Monte Carlo simulation and coincident observations of other techniques, was used to conduct continuous observations of aerosols and clouds over Beijing, China.

This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI process. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI."

The K+ channel KCNQ1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiac arrhythmia. The K+ channel BK is a large-conductance, calcium-activated K+ channel that is important for the regulation of blood pressure. The BK channel is unique in that it lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally shows no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. These findings provide insights into the mechanism of K+ channel regulation. They also suggest that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. This may be important for the development of drugs that can selectively target the BK channel. (Show more)"

The parasite must overcome a number of barriers to successfully invade the red blood cell (RBC) and begin its replication within the cell. Here, we show that the malaria parasite exploits the physical properties of the RBC to facilitate invasion. We show that the binding of the parasite’s erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 to glycophorin A on the RBC surface leads to an increase in the tension of the RBC cytoskeleton and a reduction in the bending modulus of the membrane. These changes in the RBC are correlated with parasite invasion efficiency. This work suggests that the malaria parasite primes the RBC surface through its binding antigens, altering the biophysical nature of the target cell and thus reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion. This finding would constitute a major change in our concept of malaria parasite invasion, suggesting it is, in fact, a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces working together to facilitate entry. This work has important implications for the development of new antimalarial drugs. (Show more)"

This process is essential for the survival of the cell and the organism. The stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is critical for the synthesis of the lagging strand, but the exact nature of this stability is unknown. We developed unique kinetic assays to measure the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. The results indicate that the human pol δ holoenzyme is loose and dissociates from PCNA during DNA synthesis. This behavior has profound implications for the synthesis of the lagging strand in humans."

This epidemic marked the start of the second plague pandemic, which lasted in Europe until the early 19th century. This pandemic is generally understood as the consequence of a singular introduction of Yersinia pestis, after which the disease established itself in European rodents over four centuries. To locate these putative plague reservoirs, we studied the climate fluctuations that preceded regional plague epidemics, based on a dataset of 7,711 georeferenced historical plague outbreaks and 15 annually resolved tree-ring records from Europe and Asia. We provide evidence for repeated climate-driven reintroductions of the bacterium into European harbors from reservoirs in Asia, with a delay of 15 ± 1 y. Our analysis finds no support for the existence of permanent plague reservoirs in medieval Europe. Our results have important implications for the understanding of the spread of the plague in Europe and for the development of the theory of the “plague rats.” Our findings also have implications for the spread of pathogens in general."

We demonstrate that monoclonal antibodies targeting IL1RAP have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We also show that the antibody can be used to treat primary human AML cells in vitro and in vivo. These results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML.

Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete."

The band structures of the 2D photonic crystals are predicted to produce unconventional atom–light interaction behaviors, including anisotropic emission, suppressed spontaneous decay, and photon-mediated atom–atom interactions controlled by the position of the atomic array relative to the photonic crystal. The device configuration also enables application of optical tweezers for controlled placement of atoms. Devices can be fabricated reliably from a 200-nm silicon nitride device layer using a lithography-based process, producing predicted optical properties in transmission and reflection measurements. These 2D photonic crystal devices can be readily deployed to experiments for many-body physics with neutral atoms and engineering of exotic quantum matter. The device is expected to be scalable to larger dimensions. This work opens up a new platform for studying many-body physics with neutral atoms. It also provides a promising approach for engineering exotic quantum matter in 2D and beyond. (Show more)"

We found that the stalling of RNA polymerase II at alkylated DNA lesions is strongly favored for the minor-groove alkylated DNA lesions. In contrast, the major-groove alkylated DNA lesions are prone to GMP misincorporation. Furthermore, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II, termed Pro-Gate loop, which is involved in modulating the translocation of minor-groove alkylated DNA template after nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion.

We found that these mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Therefore, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence."

This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the role of humans in increasing wildfire activity in the United States. We show that humans have vastly expanded the geographic and seasonal extent of wildfire, and that human-caused fires are disproportionately concentrated in areas where people live and work. These findings highlight the need for a better understanding of the causes of wildfire, and for actions to reduce the risk of wildfire to people and the environment."

We connect changes in the physical appearance of five US cities with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities."

Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation.
