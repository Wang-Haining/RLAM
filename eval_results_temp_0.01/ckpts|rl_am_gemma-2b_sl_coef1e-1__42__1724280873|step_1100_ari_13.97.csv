In this work, we report the structure of ice II hydrate, which is a new phase of water. The structure is determined by in situ neutron diffraction at 480 MPa and temperatures ranging from 260 to 70 K. The guest atoms are enclathrated in the host water molecules to form a hydrate. The guest atoms have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The resolved structure is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. The density distributions indicate that the vibration of guest atoms is mainly in planes perpendicular to the channels, whereas their distributions along the channels are further constrained by interactions between adjacent guest atoms. The structure of ice II hydrate is expected to be important for understanding the structure of ice II at high pressure. The structure of ice II hydrate is also important for understanding the structure of the Earth’s deep interior.

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2 in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes. We found that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to antagonize the host immune response and may help in the development of new strategies to combat the ongoing pandemic.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1.

Here, we quantify the magnitude of these effects for maize production and climate variability in the major maize-producing and -exporting countries. We find that the probability of simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year increases from 0% to 86% under 4 °C of global warming.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa from DNA sequences. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large herbivores in semiarid African savanna. We found that the extent of dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results highlight the importance of diet composition in determining the extent of dietary overlap between species. This is especially important in the context of climate change, which is expected to alter the abundance and distribution of plants and, thus, the diets of herbivores.

However, the magnitude of the problem is still unclear. We show that the global load of plastic debris on the open ocean surface is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This discrepancy is explained by the selective removal of small plastic fragments by the ocean interior. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean. This study is a major step forward in the understanding of the global distribution of plastic debris in the ocean. It will be a key reference for future studies."

The disease is characterized by the accumulation of alpha-synuclein (α-syn) aggregates in affected oligodendrocytes. Several studies point to α-syn oligomerization and aggregation as a mediator of neurotoxicity in synucleinopathies including MSA. Here we show that the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 is able to limit the accumulation of α-syn in a mouse model of MSA. This effect is associated with a reduction of truncated α-syn and with neuroprotective effects. These results suggest that VX-765 is a promising candidate to achieve disease modification in synucleinopathies by limiting α-syn accumulation. This study opens the way to the development of a clinical trial in MSA patients. This would be the first clinical trial in a synucleinopathy.

It controls vascular contractility, hemostasis, and inflammation and regulates the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products between circulating blood and tissue. To control each function, the endothelium processes endlessly arriving requests from multiple sources using separate clusters of cells specialized to detect specific stimuli. A well-developed but poorly understood communication system operates between cells to integrate multiple lines of information and coordinate endothelial responses. Here, the nature of the communication network has been addressed using single-cell Ca2+ imaging across thousands of endothelial cells in intact blood vessels. Cell activities were cross-correlated and compared to a stochastic model to determine network connections. Highly correlated Ca2+ activities occurred in scattered cell clusters, and network communication links between them exhibited unexpectedly short path lengths. The number of connections between cells (degree distribution) followed a power-law relationship revealing a scale-free network topology. The path length and degree distribution revealed an endothelial network with a “small-world” configuration. The small-world configuration confers particularly dynamic endothelial properties including high signal-propagation speed, stability, and a high degree of synchronizability. Local"

A Threonine to Alanine substitution at this position was studied in three representative members of the K+-channel family. Interestingly, all of the mutant channels exhibited lack of C-type inactivation gating and an inversion of their allosteric coupling (i.e., closing of the activation gate collapses the channel’s selectivity filter). A state-dependent crystallographic study of KcsA-T75A proves that, on activation, the selectivity filter transitions from a nonconductive and deep C-type inactivated conformation to a conductive one. Finally, we provide a crystallographic demonstration that closed-state inactivation can be achieved by the structural collapse of the channel’s selectivity filter.

These results suggest that IGF2BP1 may be a target for therapeutic intervention in hemoglobinopathies. This study also provides a potential mechanism for chronoregulation of Hb expression in humans.

In this study, we found that activating mutation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) function, highly frequent events in human cancer, confers ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells. This resistance requires sustained activation of mTORC1 and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)C1-dependent induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. Furthermore, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a transcriptional target of SREBP1, mediates the ferroptosis-suppressing activity of SREBP1 by producing monounsaturated fatty acids. Genetic or pharmacologic ablation of SREBP1 or SCD1 sensitized ferroptosis in cancer cells with PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway mutation. Conversely, ectopic expression of SREPB1 or SCD1 restored ferroptosis resistance in these cells, even when mTORC1 was inhibited. In"

This problem can be addressed by the development of new antibacterial agents to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. Computational approaches are essential tools to this end since their application enables fast and early strategical decisions in the drug development process. Here, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

Popular network architectures often add additional operations and connections to the standard architecture to enable training deeper networks. To achieve accurate results in practice, a large number of trainable parameters are often required. Here, we introduce a network architecture based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice, and automatically adapts to different problems. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data.

The vector of plague during this period is unknown, but it is thought to have been spread by rats. Here, we present a mathematical model of plague transmission by a human ectoparasite vector. We show that this model fits mortality curves from nine outbreaks in Europe better than models for rodent transmission. Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346–1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats. This work also provides a framework for future studies of the role of human ectoparasites in the spread of plague."

However, the utility of current TRAP1 inhibitors as probes of TRAP1 function is questionable because they cannot distinguish between TRAP1 and HSP90, the target of many currently available TRAP1 inhibitors. We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This work provides a mechanistic explanation for the antitumor activity of TRAP1 inhibitors and suggests that TRAP1 may be a promising target for cancer therapy"

The existence of this body size attractor and the relatively rapid selection toward, and limited deviation from, this attractor rule out most hypothesized drivers of size increase. These three independent body size increases and a shared aquatic optimum size are consistent with control by differences in the scaling of energetic intake and cost functions with body size between the terrestrial and aquatic realms.

The temperature dependence of rhinovirus replication has been attributed to a reduced antiviral defense response of infected cells at cool temperature. Here, we show that mouse airway cells infected with mouse-adapted rhinovirus exhibit a striking enrichment in expression of antiviral defense response genes at 37 °C relative to 33 °C. This temperature-dependent induction of antiviral defense response is dependent on the MAVS protein, a key signaling adaptor of the RIG-I–like receptors (RLRs). Stimulation of mouse airway cells with the synthetic RLR ligand poly I:C leads to greater induction of type I IFN at 37 °C relative to 33 °C. Genetic deficiency of MAVS or the type I IFN receptor in infected airway cells permits higher levels of viral replication, particularly at 37 °C, and partially rescues the temperature-dependent growth phenotype.

The most famous example is the sandpile model, where the activity level of the system is the number of grains of sand on the system. In this paper, we study the sandpile model in the continuum limit, where the activity level is a continuous variable. We show that the model exhibits a phase transition between a critical state and a noncritical state. We also show that the model is related to pattern formation and proportional growth phenomena. Our aim is to present an idealized tropical toy model, requiring further investigation."

These findings offer opportunities for tailoring properties of diamond for electronic, photonic, and quantum applications. The machine-learning approach to solve the multidimensional strain problem is a promising approach for solving other multidimensional problems in materials science. The neural network model can be trained to predict the properties of diamond under strain, and can be used to explore the strain space to find the optimal strain for a given application.

In contrast, female-derived proteins begin to associate with sperm immediately after mating and comprise nearly 20% of the postmating sperm proteome.

Mutations in VWF cause the common bleeding disorder, von Willebrand disease (VWD). The A1 domain in VWF binds to glycoprotein Ibα (GPIbα) on platelets, in a reaction triggered, in part, by alterations in flow during bleeding. We report that force application switches A1 and/or GPIbα to a second state with faster on-rate, providing a mechanism for activating VWF binding to platelets. Switching occurs near 10 pN, a force that also induces a state of the receptor−ligand complex with slower off-rate. Force greatly increases the effects of VWD mutations, explaining pathophysiology. Conversion of single molecule kon (s−1) to bulk phase kon (s−1M−1) and the kon and koff values extrapolated to zero force for the low-force pathways show remarkably good agreement with bulk-phase measurements. This is the first demonstration of a mechanism for conformational regulation of a protein.

However, the ACI is complex and difficult to be well represented in current climate models. Progress on understanding ACI processes is hampered by inadequate observational capability. High-resolution and simultaneous observations of diurnal aerosol loading and cloud microphysical properties are challenging for current remote-sensing techniques. To overcome this conundrum, we introduce the dual-field-of-view (FOV) high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) for simultaneously profiling aerosol and water cloud properties, especially water cloud microphysical properties. Continuous observations of aerosols and clouds using this instrument, verified by the Monte Carlo simulation and coincident observations of other techniques, were conducted to investigate the interactions between aerosol loading and water cloud microphysical properties. A case study over Beijing highlights the scientific potential of dual-FOV HSRL to become a significant contributor to the ACI investigations. The observed water cloud profiles identify that due to air entrainment its vertical structure is not perfectly adiabatic, as assumed by many current retrieval methods. These observations obtained from the dual-FOV HSRL constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI process. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI."

We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

Globally, fossil-fuel-related emissions account for about 65% of the excess mortality, and 70% of the climate cooling by anthropogenic aerosols. The chemical influence of air pollution on aeolian dust contributes to the aerosol cooling. Since aerosols mask the anthropogenic rise in global temperature, removing fossil-fuel-generated particles liberates 0.51 °C and all pollution particles 0.73 °C warming, reaching around 2 °C over North America and Northeast Asia. The steep temperature increase from removing aerosols can be moderated to about 0.36 °C globally by the simultaneous reduction of tropospheric ozone and methane.

Finally, our findings suggest that small ALKAL proteins may be useful as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in neuroblastoma. This study provides a better understanding of the role of ALKALs in neural crest development and the development of neuroblastoma. It also provides a foundation for the development of small molecule inhibitors of ALKALs as therapeutic targets in neuroblastoma."

We present 17 Yersinia pestis genomes from the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age period, which span a wide geographic expanse across Eurasia. Our results show that the plague lineage was nonflea-adapted and potentially extinct in the Late Neolithic, but rapidly spread across continents throughout this period. We also discover the presence of the flea-adapted form of plague in Bronze Age Iberia, previously only identified in the Caucasus and the Volga regions, suggesting a much wider geographic spread of this form of plague. Together, these data reveal the dynamic nature of plague’s formative years in terms of its early evolution and ecology. (Show more)"

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, in the days (Studies 1 and 2) and months (Studies 3 through 6) following the 2016 American presidential election, women’s and men’s endorsement of HM predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. In addition, as conceptualized, HM was associated with less trust in the government (Study 3), more sexism (Study 4), more racism (Study 5), and more xenophobia (Study 6) but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors.

The extent to which soil health management practices can mitigate these losses remains highly uncertain. We investigated the effects of soil health management practices on SOC and microbial traits in a 29-y-old field experiment in the North Central United States. We found that soil health management practices that minimized soil disturbance, diversified crop rotations, and/or added manure or legumes to annual cropping systems increased SOC and microbial biomass, but did not increase the amount of SOC stored in the mineral fraction. These results highlight the potential of well-managed grasslands to sequester SOC and provide a climate-smart agricultural system. (Show more)"

One of the main rewards plants offer to pollinators for visitation is nectar. Nesocodon mauritianus (Campanulaceae) produces a blood-red nectar that has been proposed to serve as a visual attractant for pollinator visitation. Here, we show that the nectar’s red color is derived from a previously undescribed alkaloid termed nesocodin. We identify a series of enzymes that are necessary or sufficient for the production of this pigment. We also identify nesocodin in the red nectar of the distantly related and hummingbird-visited Jaltomata herrerae and provide molecular evidence for convergent evolution of this trait. This work cumulatively identifies a convergently evolved trait in two vertebrate-pollinated species, suggesting that the red pigment is selectively favored and that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation. This work also provides a new alkaloid for the study of plant–pollinator interactions. (Show more)"

Our data indicate that the genetic ancestry of men generally resembles that of modern northern and central Europeans, while women exhibit a very high genetic heterogeneity; this includes signals of genetic ancestry ranging from western Europe to East Asia. In addition, we found that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago. These results provide insights into the genetic history of Europe during the Early Medieval period and suggest that complex demographic processes may have contributed in an unexpected way to shape the modern European genetic landscape.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. First, whereas MERS-CoV prefers human DPP4 over bat DPP4 as its receptor, HKU4 shows the opposite trend. Second, in the absence of exogenous proteases, both MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes mediate pseudovirus entry into bat cells, whereas only MERS-CoV spike, but not HKU4 spike, mediates pseudovirus entry into human cells.

Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

The color of an animal is determined by the absorption spectrum of its pigments. In some species, the absorption spectrum is modified by the presence of proteins that bind the pigments. These proteins are called color-modifying proteins. In this study, we describe a new class of color-modifying proteins in vertebrates. These proteins bind biliverdin, the pigment that is the main component of the green pigment, chlorophyll. We show that these proteins are most similar to human alpha-1-antitrypsin, but with a remarkable functional diversification. Our results present molecular and functional evidence of recurrent evolution of chlorosis, describe a biliverdin-binding protein in vertebrates, and introduce a function for a member of the serpin superfamily, the largest and most ubiquitous group of protease inhibitors. This study provides a unique example of the functional diversification of a serpin. (Show more)"

These findings suggest that ALKBH5 may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of breast cancer.

The source of the parchment, often called “uterine vellum,” has been a long-standing controversy in codicology. The Latin term abortivum in many sources has led some scholars to suggest that fetal calves or sheep skins were used. Others have argued that it would not be possible to sustain herds if so many pocket Bibles were made from fetal skins, arguing instead for unexpected alternatives, such as rabbit. Here, we report a simple and objective method using standard conservation treatments to identify the animal origin of parchment. The noninvasive method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals. These results suggest that ultrafine vellum does not necessarily derive from the use of abortive or newborn animals with ultrathin hides, but could equally well reflect a production"

However, the role of RORα in the intestinal epithelium is still unclear.

RORαΔIEC mice exhibit excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs.

There is an urgent need for novel and more efficient therapies, ideally targeting AML stem cells that are essential for maintaining the disease. We show here that monoclonal antibodies targeting the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML.

This paper demonstrates that the use of crop expert surveys can overcome these challenges and provide a cost-effective and scalable solution to monitor crop status. We show that the US Department of Agriculture’s Crop Progress and Condition survey, despite its subjective nature, can be transformed into a continuous and probabilistic variable that can be used to monitor crop status and provide earlier and more precise predictions of crop yields than official forecasts released midseason.

Despite considerable scientific attention in recent decades, the overall response of soil respiration to anticipated climatic warming remains unclear. We synthesize the largest global dataset to date of soil respiration, moisture, and temperature measurements, totaling &gt;3,800 observations representing 27 temperature manipulation studies, spanning nine biomes and over 2 decades of warming. Our analysis reveals no significant differences in the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration between control and warmed plots in all biomes, with the exception of deserts and boreal forests. Thus, our data provide limited evidence of acclimation of soil respiration to experimental warming in several major biome types, contrary to the results from multiple single-site studies. Our analysis adds a unique cross-biome perspective on the temperature response of soil respiration, information critical to improving our mechanistic understanding of how soil carbon dynamics change with climatic warming.

It is also one of the most challenging to model, as it involves the loss of a major function of the cell, photosynthesis. Here, we show that the transition to a parasitic lifestyle, characterized by the parasite’s dependence on a host to fulfill its life cycle, rather than the loss of photosynthesis, is linked to the relaxation of functional constraints on the plastid genome. Our findings suggest that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner. During the functional reduction process, the elevation of evolutionary rates reaches several new rate equilibria, possibly relating to the modified protein turnover rates in heterotrophic plastids. This study provides a new perspective on the molecular evolution of the plastid genome and its role in the origin and evolution of life. (Show more)"

We use a high-resolution large ensemble to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the probability of occurrence of multiyear rainfall deficits in southwestern South Africa. We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% by the year 2100 under an intermediate-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5 [SSP2-4.5]) and to 80% under a high-emission scenario (SSP5-8.5).

This reaction is catalyzed by two unrelated cyclase enzymes using different chemistries. The majority of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria use BchE, an O2-sensitive [4Fe-4S] cluster protein, whereas plants, cyanobacteria, and some phototrophic bacteria possess an O2-dependent enzyme, the major catalytic component of which is a diiron protein, AcsF.

Therefore, it is difficult to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a unique example of a convergent mechanism across multiple autism-risk genes. This study also provides a model system for studying the molecular mechanisms of behavioral flexibility. This study will be useful for understanding the etiology of autism and for developing new treatments for autism. (Show more)"

Here, we show that prophylactic and therapeutic treatment with remdesivir in a nonhuman primate model of MERS-CoV infection reduced the severity of disease and prevented the formation of lung lesions. These data support the use of remdesivir in a clinical trial for the treatment of MERS-CoV infection. It may also be considered for the treatment of other coronaviruses, including the currently emerging novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV. This is the first report of the use of remdesivir in a nonhuman primate model of MERS-CoV infection.

In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We found that pol II stalling at O2-EtdT and N3-EtdT sites is exacerbated by TFIIS-stimulated proofreading activity. Assessment for the impact of the EtdT lesions on individual fidelity checkpoints provided further mechanistic insights, where the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion.

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive design-based analysis of the effect of universal vote-by-mail—a policy under which every voter is mailed a ballot in advance of the election—on electoral outcomes. We find that universal vote-by-mail does not appear to affect either party’s share of turnout, does not appear to increase either party’s vote share, and modestly increases overall average turnout rates.

Our findings provide a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help us to predict the stability of the coral holobiont in light of its metabolic interactions. This may ultimately help us to develop more effective management strategies for coral reefs."

We also show that ROR1 expression is associated with the emergence of breast cancer stemness. Finally, we show that targeting ROR1 with the humanized anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab can reduce the emergence of breast cancer stemness and improve the response to chemotherapy in mice bearing breast cancer patient-derived xenografts. These results suggest that targeting ROR1 may improve the response to chemotherapy of patients with breast cancer. (Show more)"

Moreover, subjects with increased gut permeability also had altered composition and activity of the gut microbiota. These results suggest the existence of a gut–brain axis in alcohol dependence, which implicates the gut microbiota as an actor in the gut barrier and in behavioral disorders.

Herein, we report the delivery of siRNAs to plants with DNA nanostructures. We show that the size, shape, compactness, stiffness, and attachment locus of the DNA nanostructure determine the internalization efficiency and corresponding gene silencing efficiency. Our work establishes the feasibility of delivering biomolecules to plants with DNA nanostructures and also details the design parameters of importance for plant cell internalization and also assesses the impact of DNA nanostructure geometry for gene silencing mechanisms.

However, decades of monitoring and regulatory efforts have focused almost exclusively on the largest watersheds, overlooking the role of smaller tributaries. We show that the 6 largest tributaries of Lake Michigan account for ∼70% of the daily nutrient loads delivered to the lake. However, small tributaries exhibit nutrient loads that are high for their size and biased toward dissolved inorganic forms. This suggests that nutrient inputs from small watersheds may be more important than previously thought in fueling coastal algal blooms. Our findings highlight the importance of small watersheds in driving coastal eutrophication and provide a framework for targeting nutrient management efforts to reduce the ecological impacts of nutrient loading on valuable nearshore ecosystems.

Here we show that NMDAR-Ab antibodies can change the spectral composition of spontaneous EEG activity and predispose brain dynamics to paroxysmal abnormalities. We validate a dynamic causal model of NMDAR-Ab effects on cortical microcircuitry and show that key synaptic parameters can explain EEG paroxysms in pediatric patients with NMDAR-Ab encephalitis. Finally, we show that NMDAR-Ab–related changes render microcircuitry critically susceptible to overt EEG paroxysms when these key parameters are changed. These findings offer mechanistic insights into circuit-level dysfunction induced by NMDAR-Ab. They also suggest that the same parameter fluctuations that are tolerated in the in silico model of the control condition can lead to overt EEG paroxysms when these parameters are changed, even though the same parameter fluctuations are not tolerated in the in silico model of the condition. This suggests that the same mechanism may be responsible for the paroxysmal EEG abnormalities in both pediatric and adult patients. This is the first study to show that NMDAR-Ab–related"

The organic matter is likely derived from the destruction of large marine organisms, such as trilobites, which are abundant in the geological record. The organic matter is a valuable source of carbon, which can be used to fuel the global warming. The organic matter injection is also likely to have caused a global warming."

Certification is the tool most used to fulfill these procurement policies, and around 20% of global palm oil production was certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) in 2017. However, the effect of certification on deforestation in oil palm plantations remains unclear. Here, we use a comprehensive dataset of RSPO-certified and noncertified oil palm plantations (∼188,000 km2) in Indonesia, the leading producer of palm oil, as well as annual remotely sensed metrics of tree cover loss and fire occurrence, to evaluate the impact of certification on deforestation and fire from 2001 to 2015. Our results suggest that certification reduced deforestation in Indonesia. However, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and"

The exocyst complex is evolutionarily conserved in plants, and its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. However, the study of the dynamic regulation of the exocyst-related processes in plants is limited by the severity of phenotypes. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 (exocyst component of 70 kDa) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

Here we investigate the effects of multiple interacting sex determination alleles in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii, where two alleles (W and Y) interact to produce siblings with four possible sex classes: ZZXX females, ZWXX females, ZWXY females, and ZZXY males. We find that multiple alleles can produce modular variation in morphological and behavioral traits, and that the introgression of a newly acquired sex determiner can create additional axes of variation for varied traits. These results provide context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of multiple interacting sex determination alleles in populations. (Show more)"

We sought to understand how iron (Fe) impacts the retina, given that retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are also challenged by accumulations of bisretinoids. We found that Fe levels impact the retina. In albino mice with reduced Fe levels, as measured by the transferrin receptor, bisretinoid levels were reduced. In mice with increased Fe levels, as measured by the hephaestin and ceruloplasmin knockout, bisretinoid levels were increased. These findings indicate that Fe promotes the formation of bisretinoids. This interpretation was supported by experiments showing that Fe reduced the oxidative/degradation of the bisretinoid A2E in the presence of light and reduced cell death in cell-based experiments. Moreover, light-independent oxidation and degradation of A2E by Fenton chemistry products were evidenced by the consumption of A2E, release of dicarbonyls, and generation of oxidized A2E species in cell-free assays. These findings have implications for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration. (Read more)"

Our results suggest that the evolution of specialization is linked to the evolution of morphological and functional innovations in separate structures. These findings contribute to a broader perspective on predatory niche diversification, and help us understand how specialization has shaped present-day food webs."

The enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) is a key metabolic enzyme, converting serine to glycine and a folate-bound one-carbon unit. In mammals, SHMT1 is cytosolic, and SHMT2 is mitochondrial. We show that dual knockout of SHMT1 and SHMT2 blocks colon cancer tumor growth in mice. We also identify small-molecule dual inhibitors of SHMT1 and SHMT2, and demonstrate that they are effective in cellular assays. Finally, we show that formate can rescue cells from SHMT inhibition, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of DLBCL.

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants."
