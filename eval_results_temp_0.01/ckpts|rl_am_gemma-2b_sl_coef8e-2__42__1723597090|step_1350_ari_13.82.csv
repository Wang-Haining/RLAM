We have generated genomic and transcriptomic assemblies for two distantly related species of myxozoans and compared these to the genome and transcriptome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results show that myxozoans are a sister group to the cnidarians and that the myxozoan body plan was reduced to a minimal level. In addition, we find that myxozoans lack key elements of signaling pathways and transcriptional factors important for multicellular development. These results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This is the first time to our knowledge that a taxonomic sampling that represents the breadth of myxozoan diversity has been used to infer the evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa. This study provides a unique perspective on the evolution of the Myxozoa and the origin of parasitism. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that the SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein Orf6 is able to block nuclear translocation of the transcription factors STAT1 and STAT2, which are key players in the induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We found that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1, which is a key factor in the docking of the cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex. Our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a deeper understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the host immune response and provides a potential target for the development of new antiviral strategies.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels. This study is of interest to the general public because it describes a mechanism of action for a drug target that is used in the treatment of cancer."

We use a statistical model to predict the impact of climate change on maize yields in the major maize-producing and -exporting countries. We find that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields will increase to values much larger than present-day values, and the probability that they have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year will increase. These results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. They also underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance."

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species of wild and domestic large mammals in semiarid African savanna. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers. Grass consumption was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of % grass consumption, indicating that RRA conveys reliable quantitative information about consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammal assemblages, and that large mammal diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This may have important implications for the management of large mammal populations and the conservation of biodiversity."

However, the magnitude of the problem is still unclear. We show that the global load of floating plastic debris is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This is due to the selective removal of small plastic fragments by the ocean interior. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

The synthesized structures are manufactured via multimaterial fabrication, and their highly nonlinear responses are physically and accurately realized in experiments. The proposed synthesis, multimaterial fabrication, and heteroassembly strategy can be utilized to design function-oriented and situation-specific mechanical devices for a wide range of applications.

In this study, we found that the activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis protects cancer cells from ferroptosis, a form of regulated necrosis driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. This resistance is mediated by the induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. In addition, we found that SREBP1-mediated lipogenesis is required for the ferroptosis-suppressing activity of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling in cancer cells.

The treatment of hypertension is the cornerstone of the treatment of heart failure. The most common drugs for treating hypertension are calcium channel blockers. These drugs are used in the majority of patients with hypertension. However, the long-term use of these drugs is associated with a higher risk of adverse effects. Our study shows that the most common drugs in this class activate the Ca2+ signaling pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells, which leads to the up-regulation of the Ca2+ channel ORAI and the activation of the Ca2+ channel ORAI. This study provides a mechanism for the adverse effects of these drugs and suggests that the use of these drugs should be limited in patients with advanced hypertension and/or cardiovascular remodeling."

Phylogenomic analyses of these uniquely comprehensive datasets resolved previously controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, both major independent origins of specialized herbivory in beetles coincide with the first appearances of an arsenal of PCWDEs encoded in their genomes. Beetle diversity thus appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding PCW"

It is also the most plastic, allowing us to learn and adapt to our environment. The evolution of the brain is therefore a key factor in the evolution of intelligence. The brain is a highly complex organ, and it is difficult to compare the brains of different species. This study uses a new method to compare the brains of different species by counting the number of neurons in each brain. The results show that the brains of reptiles are much smaller than those of birds and mammals, but the number of neurons in reptiles is much lower than in birds and mammals. This suggests that the evolution of the brain is not a simple process of increasing brain size."

We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This study provides a molecular explanation for the role of TRAP1 in cancer and suggests that TRAP1 may be a promising target for cancer therapy. (Show more)"

One of these proteins is cofilin, which is responsible for the disassembly of actin filaments. However, cofilin is also able to sever actin filaments. We show that the action of cofilin is enhanced in the presence of mechanical stress. We also show that the mechanical stress can be used to enhance the severing of actin filaments. This is important for cells, because the severing of filaments is a key process for the regulation of many cellular processes. Our results have implications for our understanding of the action of cofilin in cells and for the design of new tools for controlling the action of cofilin in vitro and in vivo."

In bacteria, the predominant decapping enzyme, ApaH, is inactivated by the very conditions of disulfide stress that enable Np4 to accumulate to high levels. Here, we show that, in Escherichia coli cells experiencing such stress, the RNA pyrophosphohydrolase RppH assumes a leading role in decapping those transcripts, preferring them as substrates over their triphosphorylated and diphosphorylated counterparts. Unexpectedly, this enzyme recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5′ termini, resulting in a one-nucleotide shift in substrate specificity. The unconventional manner in which RppH recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress. This work also provides a model for the evolution of decapping enzymes that recognize and process RNA termini in a manner distinct from the one used to process DNA. (Show more"

The study of the antifungal activity of peptides is even more so, as there are no known antifungal drugs. Here, we report the structure of a unique antifungal peptide, and its antifungal activity against multiple plant fungal pathogens. The antifungal activity of the peptide is shown to be due to its ability to bind to fungal cell walls and to induce reactive oxygen species. The antifungal activity of the peptide is shown to be effective against plant fungal pathogens, and the mode of action is shown to be effective against multiple fungal pathogens. The results of this study provide a foundation for the development of this class of peptides as a spray-on fungistat/fungicide."

In the temperate regions, seasonal influenza virus outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in humidity. While low ambient humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

This pattern of activity is consistent with a model of the brain’s processing of language in which the words are first combined into phrases and then into sentences.

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, HM predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. In addition, as conceptualized, HM was associated with less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors.

This has resulted in a massive release of carbon (C) to the atmosphere, which is a major contributor to climate change. The management of agricultural lands can mitigate this C loss, but the most effective practices remain uncertain. We show that the management of grasslands with rotational grazing can increase soil C storage on Mollisols, a soil type that is widespread in the United States and globally. This highlights the potential of well-managed grasslands to sequester carbon and provides a promising strategy for climate-smart agriculture."

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results suggest that MERS-CoV, but not HKU4, has adapted to use human cells for cross-species transmission. These findings also suggest that bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmission. Thus, the use of bat coronaviruses as a model system for studying the evolution of coronavirus pathogenesis should be reconsidered.

RORα/HDAC3-mediated attenuation of NF-κB signaling controls the balance of inflammatory responses, and therapeutic strategies targeting this epigenetic regulation could be beneficial to the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, including IBD.

These changes may facilitate binding to the receptor and the subsequent structural rearrangements required for membrane fusion. Our results suggest that the D614G mutation may increase the infectivity of the virus.

We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This study provides a proof of principle for the use of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML."

However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population.

We present a model of the trajectory of plastid genome evolution during the transition from autotrophy to a parasitic lifestyle. We show that the relaxation of functional constraints is linked to the establishment of the obligate parasitic lifestyle, characterized by the parasite’s dependence on a host to fulfill its life cycle, rather than the loss of photosynthesis. Our findings suggest that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on the plastid genome in a stepwise manner. During the functional reduction process, the elevation of evolutionary rates reaches several new rate equilibria, possibly relating to the modified protein turnover rates in heterotrophic plastids. This process may have contributed to the origin of the plastid genome."

Neuroinflammation is also known to be associated with autoimmune diseases, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Neuroinflammation is a complex process that involves multiple cell types, including microglia, astrocytes, and immune cells. In this study, we found that neuroinflammation was reduced in both the early and later stages of EAE in microglia/macrophage-specific ASK1 knockout mice, whereas only the later-stage neuroinflammation was ameliorated in astrocyte-specific ASK1 knockout mice. ASK1 signaling in microglia played a major role in generating and maintaining disease. Activated astrocytes produce key inflammatory mediators, including CCL2, that further activated and recruited microglia/macrophages, in an astrocytic ASK1-dependent manner. Our findings demonstrate cell-type–specific roles of ASK1 and suggest phase-specific ASK1-dependent glial cell interactions in EAE pathophysiology. We propose glial ASK1 as a promising therapeutic target for reducing neuroinflammation. This study provides a better understanding of the roles of ASK1 in neuroinflammation and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies"

Therefore, it is difficult to identify the causal pathways that lead to the core symptoms of autism. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a molecular mechanism for autism and suggests that the forgetting process is a common target for autism-risk genes. This study also provides a new approach to identify the causal pathways that lead to the core symptoms of autism. This approach can be extended to other complex neurodevelopmental disorders.

To explain the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in the brain and spinal cord, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

As a result, many scholars and policy makers are urging the United States to expand vote-by-mail programs to safeguard the electoral process. What are the effects of vote-by-mail? In this paper, we provide a comprehensive design-based analysis of the effect of universal vote-by-mail—a policy under which every voter is mailed a ballot in advance of the election—on electoral outcomes. We find that universal vote-by-mail does not appear to affect either party’s share of turnout, does not appear to increase either party’s vote share, and modestly increases overall average turnout rates, in line with previous estimates. All three conclusions support the conventional wisdom of election administration experts and contradict many popular claims in the media. Our results suggest that vote-by-mail is a safe and effective way to conduct elections during the COVID-19 pandemic."

However, the mechanisms underlying this process are not fully understood. Here we show that hypoxia induces cerebral edema in rats and that this process is mediated by the hypoxic induction of the expression of the corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) and its receptor type 1 (CRFR1), the aquaporin-4 water channel, and the endothelin-1 vasoconstrictor. These effects could be blocked by pretreatment with an antagonist of the CRFR1. Furthermore, we show that, in cultured astrocytes, hypoxia induces the expression of CRFR1 and AQP4, and that exogenous CRF, acting through CRFR1, triggers signaling of cAMP/PKA, intracellular Ca2+, and PKCε, leading to an up-regulation of AQP4 and cerebral edema. Finally, we show that transfected CRFR1+ contributes to edema via transfected AQP4+. These results provide a molecular explanation for the mechanism of hypoxic cerebral edema and suggest that CRFR1+AQP4+ may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of this condition.

We demonstrate that the zebrafish genome contains three genes that encode for ligands for the RTKs anaplastic lymphoma kinase (Alk) and leucocyte tyrosine kinase (Ltk). We show that these ligands are essential for the development of the zebrafish eye and the zebrafish skin. These experiments establish a physiological link between augmentor ligands and Ltk and demonstrate that particular augmentors activate Ltk in a tissue-specific context to induce iridophore differentiation from neural crest-derived cells and pigment progenitor cells.

We demonstrate that the catabolism of amino acids during heat stress promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates, which in turn promotes the growth of the coral host. These processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host.

We show that this modification is found on a subset of mRNAs and is not present on other transcripts. We also show that the 5′ modification is not a tRNA or rRNA. This 5′ modification is a nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) modification.

Fibrous sheath interacting protein 1 (FSIP1) is a cancer antigen expressed in the majority of TNBCs and is associated with poor prognosis. However, the role of FSIP1 in the progression and drug sensitivity of TNBC has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. (Show more)"

In addition, there is evidence that the composition of the gut microbiota is altered in psychiatric disorders. In the present study, we found that some, but not all, alcohol-dependent subjects developed gut leakiness, which was associated with higher scores of depression, anxiety, and alcohol craving after 3 wk of abstinence. Moreover, subjects with increased gut permeability also had altered composition and activity of the gut microbiota. These results suggest the existence of a gut–brain axis in alcohol dependence, which implicates the gut microbiota as an actor in the gut barrier and in behavioral disorders. Thus, the gut microbiota seems to be a previously unidentified target in the management of alcohol dependence. This study also provides a possible explanation for the relapsing nature of the disease."

We show that the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is sensitive to changes in temperature, and that this sensitivity is driven by changes in the thermal tolerance curves of species. As temperatures shift from ambient conditions, the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning becomes more complex, with the number of species required to maintain ecosystem functioning increasing. This increase in the number of species required to maintain ecosystem functioning is driven by two processes: an increase in the contribution of complementarity to the net biodiversity effect, and an increase in the number of species with thermal traits that are able to maintain productivity as temperatures shift from ambient conditions. Our results highlight the importance of considering the combined effects of biodiversity loss and global warming on ecosystem functioning."

This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

The retina is also challenged by the accumulation of bisretinoids, which are oxidized and degraded by ROS and RCS. We show that the levels of iron (Fe) in the retina impact the levels of bisretinoids and the viability of photoreceptor cells. We also show that the levels of Fe impact the oxidation and degradation of bisretinoids. These findings have implications for the pathogenesis of retinal diseases and for the development of therapeutic strategies. (Read more)"

In this study, we show that the evolution of the feeding strategies of siphonophores, a group of pelagic cnidarians, is linked to the evolution of their tentacles. We show that the evolution of the morphology of the tentacles is linked to the evolution of the prey that they capture. This study contributes to understanding the evolution of specialization in predators, and the mechanisms that drive the diversification of feeding strategies in the world’s food webs."

The evolution of the human hand has been a focus of intense study for many decades, and the fossil record has provided a wealth of information about the development of the hand through time. However, the evolution of the hand between 800,000 and 1.8 My old, a time interval well documented for the emergence and subsequent proliferation of Acheulian technology, has been difficult to study. Here we show that the third metacarpal styloid process, a key derived feature of the human hand, was present ∼1.42 Mya in an East African hominin from Kaitio, West Turkana, Kenya. This fossil thus provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key shared derived characteristic of modern human and Neandertal hand morphology and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato. This study provides a new perspective on the evolution of the human hand and the origins of modern human form. It also provides a new window into the evolution of the human fossil record."

The enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) converts serine into glycine and a folate-bound one-carbon unit. Cancer cells have high levels of the mitochondrial isozyme, which is up-regulated in cancer. Here we show that dual knockout of SHMT1 and SHMT2 blocks tumor growth in a colon cancer xenograft model. We also identify small-molecule dual inhibitors of SHMT1 and SHMT2, and show that they block tumor growth in a cell-line screen. However, one-carbon donor formate is a potent inhibitor of SHMT, and paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in a lymphoma cell-line screen. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of lymphoma. These results provide a foundation for the development of SHMT inhibitors as a cancer therapeutic. They also provide a metabolic rationale for the sensitivity of B-cell lines to SHMT inhibition. Finally, they provide a metabolic rationale for the sensitivity of lymphoma to formate."

In this study, we show that deforestation can have a negative impact on people’s diets, and that this can be mitigated by the presence of forests. This study has important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. This study also highlights the need for a more holistic approach to food and nutrition security that considers the role of natural landscapes such as forests."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the discovery of a "
