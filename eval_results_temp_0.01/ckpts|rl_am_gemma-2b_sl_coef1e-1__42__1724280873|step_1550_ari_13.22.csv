The structure of ice II is also of great interest in the field of materials science because it is a hydrate with a high density. In this work, we report the synthesis and structure of a hydrate with ice II structure. The guest atoms are enclathrated in the host lattices, and the guest atoms have substantial freedom of movement. The resolved structure is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. The density distributions indicate that the vibration of guest atoms is mainly in planes perpendicular to the channels, whereas their distributions along the channels are further constrained by interactions between adjacent guest atoms. This work provides a new route to synthesize hydrates with ice II structure. The results are expected to be of interest to the fields of geophysics, geochemistry, and materials science.

Although the evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we present the first comparative genomic analysis of two distantly related myxozoan species, Kudoa iwatai and Myxobolus cerebralis, and a less reduced cnidarian, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results show that the myxozoan body plan is reduced to a minimal structure, and that the genome is one of the smallest reported in animals. These results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insight into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes. Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a new insight into the mechanisms of viral antagonism in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings may help in the development of new antiviral strategies.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species of wild and domestic large mammals in semiarid African savanna. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers. Grass consumption was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of grass consumption, indicating that RRA conveys reliable quantitative information about consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This study highlights the importance of diet data at the species level and the need for more comprehensive sampling of herbivore diets.

However, the global load of plastic debris on the open ocean surface is still unknown. We show that the global load of plastic debris on the open ocean surface is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This discrepancy is explained by the selective removal of plastic debris on the open ocean surface by nano-fragmentation, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. This study provides a new perspective on the fate of plastic debris in the ocean and its potential impacts on the marine ecosystem.

The effective CPUE of most countries in 2015 was a fifth of its 1950s value, which was compared with a global decline in abundance. There are signs, however, of stabilization and more effective management in recent years, with a reduction in fleet sizes in developed countries. Based on historical patterns and allowing for the slowing rate of expansion, 1 million more motorized vessels could join the global fleet by midcentury as developing countries continue to transition away from subsistence fisheries. This will challenge sustainable use of fisheries' resources. The global fishing fleet will need to be reduced to ensure the long-term sustainability of fisheries.

Interestingly, all of the mutant channels exhibited lack of C-type inactivation gating and an inversion of their allosteric coupling (i.e., closing of the activation gate collapses the channel’s selectivity filter). A state-dependent crystallographic study of KcsA-T75A proves that, on activation, the selectivity filter transitions from a nonconductive and deep C-type inactivated conformation to a conductive one.

One promising approach is to target the metabolic vulnerabilities of cancer cells. In this study, we identified a mechanism of resistance to ferroptosis, a form of regulated necrosis driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, in cancer cells with mutations in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. This resistance is mediated by the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and the fatty acid desaturase SCD1, which promote lipogenesis and ferroptosis resistance. We show that inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis, and that combination of mTOR inhibition with ferroptosis induction shows therapeutic promise in preclinical models. These findings provide insights into the metabolic vulnerabilities of cancer cells and suggest a strategy for the development of new cancer therapies. (Show more)"

We also show that the early-seral ecosystem area has been stable, but declined in two ecoregions, and early-seral bird populations have declined. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure.

We tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

Our analyses resolved the evolutionary history of beetles and revealed that the origin of beetles and their plant-feeding habits coincide with the first appearance of genes encoding microbial enzymes that digest plant cell walls. These genes appear to have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of beetles, which resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivores following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes. Our results suggest that the evolution of beetle diversity was driven by multiple factors, including the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms.

Today, most human plague cases are caused by inhalation of infectious droplets or by the bite of infected fleas. However, the Second Pandemic (14–19th centuries) is characterized by recurrent outbreaks, which are difficult to explain with the current understanding of plague transmission. Here, we present a model for plague transmission by human ectoparasites, which is supported by the historical mortality curves of nine outbreaks in Europe. Our results suggest that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death. This study challenges the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal cells is not well understood. We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal cells and suggests that TRAP1 may be a potential therapeutic target in cancer. (truncated)"

Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to study the action of ADF/cofilin in different mechanical situations. We find that ADF/cofilin binds to filaments more efficiently in regions of high curvature, but severing is favored in regions of low curvature. We also find that filament segments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist, experience a mechanical torque upon ADF/cofilin binding. We propose that this torque dramatically enhances severing. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for how ADF/cofilin can sever highly connected filament networks. This mechanism is critical to boost ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells.

However, the role of immune peptides in the defense of plants against pests is less clear. Here, we show that a structurally unique immune peptide from a model legume, Medicago truncatula, exhibits potent fungicidal activity against multiple plant fungal pathogens. The peptide binds to multiple bioactive phosphoinositides in vitro and induces reactive oxygen species in germlings of the fungal pathogen. The peptide also exhibits potent fungicidal activity against plant fungal pathogens when applied as a spray. Our work illustrates the antifungal activity of a structurally unique immune peptide against plant fungal pathogens and paves the way for future development of this class of peptides as a spray-on fungistat/fungicide.

We here present a method for determining the temperature of the Earth’s surface based on the thermostability of ancestral enzymes.

The BK channel is unique in that it does not have an intracellular activation gate and does not show C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. We propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation.

We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden.

This response is consistent with a neural implementation of a merge operation that applies equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases. This merge operation may be a fundamental step in the brain’s construction of syntactic structures. Understanding this operation is critical for developing models of language processing that can account for the complexity of the underlying structures. (Show more)"

However, the management of agricultural lands is often at odds with SOC storage, as intensive crop production on grassland-derived Mollisols has liberated massive amounts of carbon to the atmosphere. We show that soil health management practices can increase SOC storage and mineral-associated carbon on these soils. However, the most effective practices are labor intensive and may not be compatible with the needs of the modern agricultural system. Our results highlight the importance of integrating livestock and perennial grasslands into intensive crop production systems to mitigate climate change. This article is protected by copyright.

We show that the color of the red nectar of Nesocodon mauritianus is derived from a previously undescribed alkaloid, nesocodin. We also identify a second alkaloid in the red nectar of Jaltomata herrerae, a hummingbird-visited species, and provide molecular evidence for convergent evolution of this trait. Our findings suggest that the red color of nectar is a convergently evolved trait that is likely to be important for attracting pollinators.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions.

The stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. In S. cerevisiae, the extreme stability of the pol δ holoenzyme ensures that every nucleobase within an Okazaki fragment is faithfully duplicated before dissociation. However, the stability of the human pol δ holoenzyme is unknown. We designed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. Surprisingly, the results indicate that human pol δ maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This study provides a unique insight into the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme and its implications for lagging strand synthesis in humans. This article is protected by copyright.

In the laboratory, RNA polymerases have been used to synthesize RNA molecules, but the ability to replicate nucleic acids has not been demonstrated. Here, we show that an RNA polymerase ribozyme can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins.

Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells.

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR).

Here we describe the evolution of the reaction, and the discovery of three classes of the enzyme that catalyzes this reaction. These results provide a framework for understanding the evolution of this important reaction in photosynthesis. (Show more)"

Neuroinflammation is also known to be associated with autoimmune diseases, such as EAE. Neuroinflammation is known to be regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) signaling, and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is one of the MAP3Ks. Here, we show that ASK1 is involved in neuroinflammation in EAE. We also show that ASK1 is involved in the progression of EAE. Our findings suggest that ASK1 may be a promising therapeutic target for reducing neuroinflammation. This study also provides a rationale for the use of a CX3CR1CreER system to generate microglia-specific ASK1 knockout mice. This system allows for the generation of conditional knockout mice that lack ASK1 in microglia, which is the main cell type involved in EAE progression.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility in autism and may help in the development of new therapeutic strategies. (Show more)"

To better understand how sequential proteolysis contributes to MERS-CoV infection, we introduced mutations that blocked the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into endosomes. Uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases.

Here we use quantitative proteomics to show that the surfaceome is dramatically remodeled in a panel of breast cancer cell lines expressing six of the most prominent oncogenes. We find that each oncogene has somewhat different surfaceomes, but the functions of these proteins are harmonized by common biological themes including up-regulation of nutrient transporters, down-regulation of adhesion molecules and tumor suppressing phosphatases, and alteration in immune modulators. These studies provide a broad systems-level view of how specific driver oncogenes remodel the surfaceome and the glycoproteome in a cell autologous fashion, and suggest possible surface targets, and combinations thereof, for drug and biomarker discovery. This work is a step toward understanding the role of the cell surface in cancer progression and as a potential therapeutic target.

In coordination with endogenous FOXC2 in fibroblasts, transduced ETV2 elicits expression of multiple key endothelial development factors, including FLI1, ERG, and TAL1, and induces expression of endothelial functional molecules, including EGFL7 and von Willebrand factor. Consequently, ETVECs exhibits EC characteristics in vitro and forms mature functional vasculature in Matrigel plugs transplanted in NOD SCID mice.

Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change.

The analysis of these fluctuations has led to the identification of networks of brain regions that are functionally and anatomically connected. However, the number of networks is large, and it is not clear whether they are stable or change over time. Here, we show that the dominant network in healthy subjects is topologically similar to the default mode network. In Parkinson’s disease, this dominant network is subordinated to a disease-related pattern. Network functionality was assessed by quantifying the expression of the networks in the brain during task performance. The dominant network was deactivated during task performance, and this abnormality was partially corrected by dopaminergic therapy. This work provides a new perspective on the resting brain and its functional organization. It also provides a new approach to the study of the brain in health and disease."

However, the role of FSIP1 in the progression and drug sensitivity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. This article is protected by copyright.

However, these threats are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function.

In vertebrates, sex is determined by a single locus, which can be male- or female-determining. In some species, multiple alleles at a single locus determine sex, and in others, the sex of an individual is determined by multiple loci. In this paper, we investigate the effects of multiple alleles on the secondary sexual characteristics of a species. We find that the modularity of secondary sexual characteristics produced by multiple alleles provides context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of the maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations. Our results suggest that the maintenance of multiple alleles at a sex determination locus is a key factor in the evolution of sexual polymorphism. (Show more)"

We sought to understand how Fe levels impact the retina, given that retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are also challenged by accumulations of bisretinoids that photogenerate reactive oxygen species and photodecompose into damaging aldehyde- and dicarbonyl-bearing species. In albino mice treated with the Fe chelator deferiprone (DFP), intracellular Fe levels were reduced, and bisretinoid levels were reduced. These findings indicate that intracellular Fe promotes bisretinoid oxidation and degradation. This interpretation was supported by experiments showing that DFP decreased the oxidative/degradation of the bisretinoid A2E in the presence of light and reduced cell death in cell-based experiments. Moreover, light-independent oxidation and degradation of A2E by Fenton chemistry products were evidenced by the consumption of A2E, release of dicarbonyls, and generation of oxidized A2E species in cell-free assays. These findings provide insight into the role of Fe in the retina and may lead to the development of strategies to reduce the burden of bisretinoids in"

However, the evolution of predator specialization has been considered an evolutionary dead end. Here we show that the evolution of siphonophores, a group of pelagic cnidarians, is a case study in morphological innovation and evolution. Our results show that siphonophore specialization is not a dead end, but rather a case of morphological evolution that has allowed for the diversification of predatory niches. These findings contribute to understanding how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs. This work also highlights the importance of studying the evolutionary history of predators to understand the diversity of their current ecological roles."

The fossil record of the hominin hand between 800,000 and 1.8 My old is sparse, and the origin of the derived features of the modern human hand is poorly understood. Here we report the discovery of a hominin hand from the Middle Pleistocene of East Africa that preserves the third metacarpal styloid process, a key derived feature of the modern human hand. This fossil provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of this key derived feature of the human hand and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo. This study also highlights the importance of the fossil record in understanding the evolution of the human hand. (Show more)"

One of the key metabolic pathways supporting cell growth is the one-carbon unit pathway, which supports the synthesis of purine and thymidine. The enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) is a key player in this pathway, and its inhibition is a promising strategy for cancer treatment. Here we report the discovery of small-molecule dual inhibitors of SHMT1 and SHMT2, and show that these compounds are effective in cancer cell lines. However, one-carbon donor formate is required for cellular SHMT inhibition, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in a DLBCL cell line. This finding suggests that SHMT inhibition may be a promising strategy for DLBCL treatment. This work provides a proof-of-concept for the use of SHMT inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for DLBCL, and may lead to the development of a new class of targeted therapeutics for cancer and other diseases.

This study shows that deforestation can have a negative impact on people’s diets, and that this impact can be mitigated by having access to natural landscapes such as forests. The results have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. This study also highlights the importance of using causal inference methods to understand the impact of deforestation on people’s diets. This is a relatively new area of research, and we hope that this study will encourage others to use this approach to understand the impact of deforestation on people’s diets and other aspects of their lives."

This has led to the compaction of the soil, which is a key factor limiting the productivity of agricultural land. We show that the compaction of the subsoil has become a more widespread problem over the last century, and that it now threatens the productivity of 20% of arable land. This calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery, considering intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest land animals, the sauropods, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This study highlights the need for a better understanding of the ecological history of animals to inform the design of modern agricultural machinery. It also highlights the need for a better understanding of the ecological history of animals to inform the design of modern agricultural machinery.
