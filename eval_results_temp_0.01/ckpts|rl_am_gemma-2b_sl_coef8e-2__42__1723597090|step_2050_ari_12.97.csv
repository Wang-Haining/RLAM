The structure of neon hydrate is similar to that of ice II, and the guest atoms have substantial freedom of movement. This work provides a new perspective on the structure of ice II and the formation of hydrates. It also provides a new way to study the structure of ice II.

In this study, we show that the SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein Orf6 is able to block nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are essential for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We found that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and interacts with Nup98-Rae1, a protein complex that mediates nuclear import of cargo proteins. We show that Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex is required for its ability to block nuclear import of cargo proteins and impair the antiviral action of IFN. Our findings provide a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

We find that the probability of simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year increases from 0% to 7% under 2 °C warming and to 86% under 4 °C warming. This increase in instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the 800 million people living in extreme poverty, underscores the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant African LMH species. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers. Grass consumption inferred from DNA was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of % grass consumption, indicating that DNA metabarcoding can be used to quantify diet breadth and composition. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of size-matched grazers—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. These findings have implications for understanding the role of LMH in ecosystem functioning and biodiversity. (Abridged)"

We show that the plastic debris is mostly concentrated in the convergence zones of the five subtropical gyres, but the total load is far less than expected. This is due to the fast fragmentation of the plastic debris into smaller particles, which are transported to the ocean interior and sink. This sink is size selective, and the removal of the millimeter-sized fragments is of the same order of magnitude as the accumulation of the plastic debris on the ocean surface. This study provides a better understanding of the fate of the missing plastic debris, and it is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean.

Despite the development of effective drugs, the disease remains a major public health problem. The malaria parasite, Plasmodium, is able to invade the human red blood cell (RBC) and establish a blood stage infection. The invasion process is a complex event that involves a number of parasite proteins. Here, we show that one of these proteins, erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 (EBA175), alters the physical properties of the RBC membrane, reducing the energy barrier to invasion. This finding suggests that invasion is a complex process, in which the parasite and host cell are working together to facilitate entry. This is a major change in our understanding of malaria invasion. (Show more)"

In the temperate regions, seasonal influenza virus outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in humidity. While low ambient humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide insights into the impact of dry air on host defense and disease outcome, and may help to develop strategies to reduce the impact of influenza virus infection.

Here, we demonstrate a method to control the activity of the nitrogenase enzyme complex in the soil, by engineering a plant to produce a signaling molecule that controls the activity of the nitrogenase enzyme complex in the soil.

The stability of this complex is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. In this study, we developed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. We found that the pol δ holoenzyme is stable and maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. These results provide a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanism of lagging strand synthesis and provide a foundation for future studies on the role of pol δ in human diseases. (Show more)"

In the RNA world, before the evolution of proteins, genetic information was stored in RNA molecules. In this paper, we describe the first in vitro evolution of an RNA polymerase ribozyme, which can synthesize a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and, in low yield, even tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins. This work represents a major step toward the reconstruction of the RNA world. (Show more)"

Specifically, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements, and neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. These results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

We show here that monoclonal antibodies targeting the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. This metastable state may be a common feature of other neurodegenerative diseases. (Show more)"

Assessment for the impact of the EtdT lesions on individual fidelity checkpoints provided further mechanistic insights, where the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. We found that sequential proteolysis of MERS-CoV S proteins is required for virus infection into human lung-derived cells, but not into other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence. These findings may help to explain the severe disease caused by MERS-CoV infection. (Show more)"

We connect changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods with economic and demographic data and find that three factors predict neighborhood improvement: (i) the density of college-educated adults, (ii) the initial appearance of the neighborhood, and (iii) the proximity of the neighborhood to other physically attractive neighborhoods. These results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities. Our results also suggest that the physical appearance of neighborhoods may be a useful indicator of the economic and social health of cities.

This form of regeneration is reminiscent of a well-studied form of endogenous activity-dependent ectopic axon outgrowth in the same neuron type. These connections suggest that the regeneration we describe may be a powerful platform for gene discovery in neuronal regeneration. Moreover, we note numerous similarities between this form of regeneration and conditioning, a phenomenon producing robust regeneration in the mammalian CNS.

However, the function of Si in plant defense against insect herbivores has not been well characterized. In this study, we show that Si pretreatment of rice plants increases resistance against the rice leaffolder, a major insect pest of rice, and that this effect is mediated by the jasmonate (JA) signaling pathway. These results suggest that Si may be used as a biopesticide to protect rice from insect attack. This study also provides evidence that Si and JA interact in plant defense against insect herbivores.

We demonstrate that tetrahydrobiopterin is essential for the cellular lipidome of murine macrophages and that modulation of alkylglycerol monooxygenase activity has a profound impact on the lipidome also beyond the class of ether lipids. Our results reveal a central role of tetrahydrobiopterin and alkylglycerol monooxygenase in ether lipid metabolism of murine macrophages. Furthermore, we show that alkylglycerol monooxygenase activity affects the signaling of murine macrophages.

We find that the long-time dynamics of such systems are biased toward states that exhibit a fine-tuned extremization of environmental forcing. This behavior is reminiscent of the behavior of a mechanical system that is driven by a random force. We argue that the observed behavior is a consequence of the interplay between the intrinsic dynamics of the network and the external forcing. Our results suggest that the presence of a thermodynamic forcing that is available only to rare combinations of chemical concentrations may be a general feature of chemical networks. This may have important implications for the understanding of the origin and evolution of life.

We show that the use of farm machinery has led to the development of a global map of subsoil compaction susceptibility, which is now widespread over arable land. This alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This study highlights the need for a better understanding of the ecological history of the largest animals that walked Earth. (Show more)"
