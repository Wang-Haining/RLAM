One of the most prominent proposals is to base quantum theory on a suitable category of “quantum objects.” The aim of this paper is to provide a categorical foundation for quantum theory that is purely categorical and does not presuppose any analytical structure. We show that the category of Hilbert spaces and bounded operators is equivalent to the category of continuous linear functions between Hilbert spaces. This resolves a question raised in the literature on the foundations of quantum theory. It also provides a new perspective on the nature of the mathematical structure underlying quantum theory.

Here, we present a genomic and transcriptomic analysis of two distantly related myxozoans and a cnidarian parasite. Our results show that the myxozoan body plan is reduced to the essential elements required for parasitism. In addition, we show that myxozoans have one of the smallest genomes among animals. This suggests that the transition from a free-living to parasitic lifestyle was accompanied by a reduction in genome size and gene content. This may have been a key step in the evolution of parasitism. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The virus has been shown to evade the antiviral action of interferon (IFN) by blocking nuclear import of STAT1 and STAT2. In this study, we show that the viral accessory protein ORF6 is responsible for this evasion mechanism. We demonstrate that ORF6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1. We show that this interaction is required for the antiviral activity of ORF6. Our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 and may lead to the development of new antiviral strategies. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of proton channels, but the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels is not completely understood. Here, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

However, the extent to which different species of herbivores partition resources is largely unknown. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammalian herbivores in semiarid African savanna. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers. Grass consumption was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of grass consumption, indicating that RRA conveys reliable quantitative information about consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption, but dietary composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages. The implications of our findings for understanding the role of herbivores in ecosystems are discussed. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

However, the global load of floating plastic debris is still unknown. We show that the plastic debris load in the open ocean is far less than expected. This is due to the size-selective sinks of floating plastic debris in the ocean interior. The plastic debris is first fragmented into smaller pieces, which are then transported to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes. This process may explain the missing plastic debris in the open ocean. This study provides a better understanding of the fate of the plastic debris in the ocean and its impacts on the ecosystem. It also provides a better basis for the development of effective solutions to reduce the plastic pollution in the ocean. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The underlying molecular mechanisms of hypertension-induced heart failure are complex and not fully understood. Here, we show that the three major classes of L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs) activate STIM/ORAI-mediated Ca2+ entry in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. Our findings unravel a mechanism of LCCBs action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. This study provides a rationale for the use of LCCBs in the treatment of hypertension. Our data also provide a potential target for the development of new drugs for the treatment of heart failure.

The vector of plague is the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which can be transmitted by multiple transmission pathways. Here, we propose a model for plague transmission by a human ectoparasite vector. We show that this model fits mortality curves from nine outbreaks in Europe better than models for pneumonic or rodent transmission. Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346–1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats. This study provides a better understanding of the history of plague in Europe and may help to prevent future outbreaks. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

However, this approach is biased because brain size is not the fundamental unit of computation. This study shows that the evolution of brain size in amniotes is characterized by four major shifts in the number of neurons. The most dramatic increases in neuron numbers occurred with the evolution of birds and mammals, resulting in convergent scaling of brain neurons in these two endothermic lineages. The other two major increases in neuron numbers happened in core land birds and anthropoid primates, which are two groups known for their cognitive prowess. These results have important implications for studies using relative brain size as a proxy when looking for evolutionary drivers of animal cognition."

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal and transformed cells is more complex than previously appreciated. We have shown that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1 may act as a tumor suppressor in some settings. These data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This may be particularly true in the context of cancers with a low level of TRAP1 expression. (PsycINFO Database Record"

We also find that the settlement of Madagascar happened recently, with a limited paternal contribution from Europe and the Middle East. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the settlement was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population.

Here we demonstrate that the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa detects contact with surfaces on short timescales using the mechanical activity of its type IV pili, a major surface adhesin. This signal transduction mechanism requires attachment of type IV pili to a solid surface, followed by pilus retraction and signal transduction through the Chp chemosensory system, a chemotaxis-like sensory system that regulates cAMP production and transcription of hundreds of genes, including key virulence factors. Like other chemotaxis pathways, pili-mediated surface sensing results in a transient response amplified by a positive feedback that increases type IV pili activity, thereby promoting long-term surface attachment that can stimulate additional virulence and biofilm-inducing pathways. The methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein-like chemosensor PilJ directly interacts with the major pilin subunit PilA. These findings demonstrate that P. aeruginosa not only uses type IV pili for surface-specific twitching motility, but also as a sensor regulating surface-induced gene expression and pathogenicity.

However, the structural basis for their antifungal activity is not well understood. Here, we report the structure of a 36-residue NCR peptide from Medicago truncatula, which exhibits potent antifungal activity against multiple plant fungal pathogens. The structure of the peptide is largely disordered and dynamic, with one four-residue α-helix and one three-residue antiparallel β-sheet stabilized by two disulfide bonds. The peptide binds to multiple bioactive phosphoinositides in vitro. In germlings, it breaches the fungal cell wall, penetrates the cell membrane at discrete foci, and accumulates in the cytoplasm and nucleoli. The antifungal activity of the peptide is due to its ability to bind to the fungal cell wall and its ability to induce reactive oxygen species. The structural and functional data presented here provide a structural basis for the antifungal activity of the NCR peptides and pave the way for future development of this class of peptides as a spray-on fungistat/fungicide.

K+ channels commonly possess two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We induced C-type inactivation in BK channels and studied the relationship between activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery. We observed prominent slow C-type inactivation/recovery in BK channels by an extreme low concentration of extracellular K+ together with a Y294E/K/Q/S or Y279F mutation whose equivalent in Shaker channels (T449E/K/D/Q/S or W434F) caused a greatly accelerated rate of C-type inactivation or constitutive C-inactivation.

Here, we show that the parasite erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 (EBA175) binding to glycophorin A (GPA) on the RBC surface leads to an increase in the cytoskeletal tension of the RBC and a reduction in the bending modulus of the cell’s membrane. These changes in the biophysical properties of the RBC are correlated with parasite invasion efficiency. This finding suggests that the malaria parasite primes the RBC surface through its binding antigens, altering the biophysical nature of the target cell and thus reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion. This would constitute a major change in our concept of malaria parasite invasion, suggesting it is, in fact, a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces working together to facilitate entry.

In the temperate regions, seasonal outbreaks of influenza virus correlate with decreases in ambient humidity. While low humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes them more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

This merge operation was consistent across multiple brain areas and was best explained by a model of phrase construction. Our results provide initial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases.

The auditory organs of these animals are extremely diverse in anatomy after hundreds of millions of years of evolution, yet all are made up of cellular tissue and are morphologically part of the bodies of animals. Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. We find that the wispy, wheel-shaped orb web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to capture the sound-induced air particle movements that approach the maximum physical efficiency better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By sensing the motion of web threads, the spider remotely detects and localizes the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave, such as those emitted by approaching prey or predators. By outsourcing and supersizing of auditory function in spiders provides unique features for studying extended and regenerative sensing and designing novel acoustic flow detectors for precise fluid dynamic measurement and manipulation.

We show that Y. pestis underwent a series of evolutionary steps during this period, and that the pathogen diversified rapidly across Eurasia. This rapid diversification was accompanied by a shift in the vector, from fleas to rodents, and may have been facilitated by the spread of humans across continents. These data provide a unique perspective on the formative years of plague, and its potential role in the dispersal of humans across Eurasia. This article is protected by copyright.

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, HM predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. HM was associated with less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia, but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors. The findings highlight the importance of psychological examinations of masculinity as a cultural ideology to understand how men’s and women’s endorsement of HM legitimizes patriarchal dominance and reinforces gender, race, and class-based hierarchies via candidate support.

However, the management of annual cropping systems on grassland-derived Mollisols has resulted in massive SOC losses. Here, we show that soil health management practices that increase soil microbial biomass and diversity, such as incorporating legumes and manure, can increase SOC storage in annual cropping systems. However, these practices did not increase mineral-associated organic carbon, which is the most recalcitrant form of SOC. In contrast, rotational grazing of pastures on grassland-derived Mollisols increased mineral-associated organic carbon and total SOC storage. These results highlight the potential of well-managed grasslands to sequester SOC on agricultural lands. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

We also identify the enzymes responsible for the production of this pigment and show that the same enzymes are involved in the production of a red pigment in the hummingbird-visited Jaltomata herrerae. These findings suggest that the red color of nectar is a convergent trait that is likely to be favored by natural selection.

This is particularly striking in women with artificial skull deformations, who also differed in visible characteristics. In addition, we show that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions. Our findings are important for understanding the origins of MERS-CoV and for developing countermeasures against future bat coronavirus-caused epidemics. This article is protected by"

The lagging strand of the DNA template is replicated by the DNA polymerase δ (pol δ) holoenzyme, which is anchored to the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) sliding clamp. The stability of this complex is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. We designed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. The results indicate that human pol δ maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This study provides a unique insight into the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme and its implications for the replication of the lagging strand. It also provides a unique model for studying the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme in other organisms. This study will be of interest to the broader community of DNA replication researchers.

However, the mechanisms by which hypoxia promotes the growth of breast cancer are not fully understood. Here, we show that hypoxia induces expression of AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), which demethylates N6-methyladenosine (m6A) on the NANOG mRNA, which encodes a breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) marker. ALKBH5 expression is induced by hypoxia through the hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1α and HIF-2α. NANOG mRNA demethylation and NANOG protein expression are increased in hypoxia-treated breast cancer cells, and ALKBH5 overexpression increases the percentage of BCSCs. Thus, ALKBH5 expression in response to hypoxia may contribute to the growth of breast cancer. These findings may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for breast cancer.

The first pocket Bibles were made in the 13th century. The source of this parchment, often called “uterine vellum,” has been a long-standing controversy in codicology. Here, we report a simple and objective method to identify the animal origin of parchment. The method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals; however, we did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides. These results suggest that ultrafine vellum does not necessarily derive from the use of abortive or newborn animals with ultrathin hides, but could equally well reflect a production process that allowed the skins of maturing animals of several species to be rendered into vellum of equal quality and fineness."

The age of the extinction is a key parameter for understanding the causes and consequences of the event. Here we present a precise age model for the extinction and its aftermath, based on U-Pb dating of volcanic ash beds. The age of the extinction is 251.941 ± 0.037 and 251.880 ± 0.031 My, an interval of 60 ± 48 ka. The carbon cycle reorganization precedes the extinction and is punctuated by a sharp negative spike in the isotopic composition of carbonate carbon. The carbon cycle volatility persists for ∼500 ka before a return to near preextinction values. This age model will allow a refined evaluation of the relative roles of rate-dependent processes contributing to the extinction, providing insight into the postextinction ecosystem expansion. The age model will also allow a more accurate evaluation of the plausibility of trigger and kill mechanisms.

RORαΔIEC mice exhibit excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs.

We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA.

We use a high-resolution climate model to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the probability of occurrence of multiyear rainfall deficits in southwestern South Africa. We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% by the year 2100 under an intermediate-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5) and to 80% under a high-emission scenario (SSP5-8.5). These results highlight the strong sensitivity of the drought risk in SSA to future anthropogenic emissions. This work is a first step towards a better understanding of the role of anthropogenic climate change in the occurrence of extreme droughts in SSA. However, the model used here has a coarse horizontal resolution, which limits the ability to precisely quantify the changing likelihood of extreme droughts.</i>"

The formation of the isocyclic fifth ring, the key reaction in the biosynthesis of these pigments, has remained enigmatic for more than 60 y. This reaction is catalyzed by two unrelated enzymes using different chemistries. The majority of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria use a [4Fe-4S] cluster protein, whereas plants, cyanobacteria, and some phototrophic bacteria possess a diiron protein. Plant and cyanobacterial mutants in ycf54 display impaired function of the diiron enzyme, accumulating the reaction substrate. Swapping cyclases between cyanobacteria and purple phototrophic bacteria reveals three classes of the diiron enzyme. These data delineate three classes of the diiron cyclase in chlorophototrophic organisms from higher plants to bacteria, and their evolution is discussed herein. (PsycINFO Database Record"

Neuroinflammation is associated with the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) ASK1. In this study, we found that ASK1 in microglia/macrophages plays a major role in the early and later stages of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). ASK1 deficiency in T cells and dendritic cells had no significant effects on EAE severity. Activated astrocytes produce key inflammatory mediators, including CCL2, which further activated and recruited microglia/macrophages, in an astrocytic ASK1-dependent manner. Astrocyte-specific analysis revealed CCL2 expression was higher in the later stage compared with the early stage, suggesting a greater proinflammatory role of astrocytes in the later stage. Our findings demonstrate cell-type–specific roles of ASK1 and suggest phase-specific ASK1-dependent glial cell interactions in EAE pathophysiology. We propose glial ASK1 as a promising therapeutic target for reducing neuroinflammation. These findings may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases.

The drought began in 2012 and now includes the lowest calendar-year and 12-mo precipitation, the highest annual temperature, and the most extreme drought indicators on record. The extremely warm and dry conditions have led to acute water shortages, groundwater overdraft, critically low streamflow, and enhanced wildfire risk. We find that precipitation deficits in California were more than twice as likely to yield drought years if they occurred when conditions were warm. We also find that although there has not been a substantial change in the probability of either negative or moderately negative precipitation anomalies in recent decades, the occurrence of drought years has been greater in the past two decades than in the preceding century. Finally, we conclude that anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of co-occurring warm–dry conditions like those that have created the acute human and ecosystem impacts associated with the “exceptional” 2012–2014 drought in California. This finding has important implications for the future of California and other regions of the world experiencing or projected to experience continued warming."

The etiology of autism is so complicated because it involves the effects of variants of several hundred risk genes along with the contribution of environmental factors. Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. As an alternative approach, extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying the convergence of the targets and functions of the autism-risk genes to facilitate mapping out causal paths. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. Mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility"

This study shows that teachers’ mindsets about discipline can be changed through scalable intervention. The intervention was simple: teachers were asked to reflect on the perspectives of students in their classroom. This intervention halved suspension rates in the field and bolstered the respect of suspended students for their teachers. These findings have implications for the design of scalable interventions to reduce suspension rates. They also have implications for the design of school discipline policies.

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis remain unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We found that the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion. For the N3-EtdT lesion that disrupts base pairing, multiple transcriptional lesion bypass routes were found. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop). The Pro-Gate loop faces toward the minor groove of RNA:DNA hybrid and is involved in modulating the translocation of minor-groove alkylated DNA template after"

Virions require spike (S) proteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Virions must first be cleaved sequentially by cell-surface proteases, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. Here, we show that the first cleavages are required for infection into human lung-derived cells, but have little effect on infection into other cell types. These findings suggest that the first cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence. This study also provides a model for understanding how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection. This model may be useful for understanding how other CoVs, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), may be adapted to cause infection in new hosts.

This paper provides a comprehensive design-based analysis of the effect of universal vote-by-mail on electoral outcomes. We find that universal vote-by-mail does not appear to affect either party’s share of turnout, does not appear to increase either party’s vote share, and modestly increases overall average turnout rates. All three conclusions support the conventional wisdom of election administration experts and contradict many popular claims in the media. Our findings suggest that vote-by-mail is a safe and effective way to conduct elections during the pandemic. They also suggest that the benefits of vote-by-mail are likely to be modest and that the costs of implementing such a program are likely to be high."

However, the mechanisms underlying this process are not fully understood. Here we show that hypobaric hypoxia induces cerebral edema in rats and that this process is mediated by the hypoxic-induced release of corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) from the hypothalamus. CRF acts on the cerebral cortex via its receptor CRFR1 to trigger signaling of cAMP/PKA in astrocytes, leading to activation of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and cerebral edema. These findings provide a molecular basis for the development of cerebral edema in hypoxia. They also suggest that CRFR1 antagonists may be useful in the treatment of cerebral edema in hypoxia.

ETV2-mediated conversion of fibroblasts into ETVECs is independent of the differentiation of fibroblasts into ECs. ETVECs exhibit EC characteristics in vitro and form mature functional vasculature in Matrigel plugs transplanted in NOD SCID mice. Furthermore, ETVECs significantly improve blood flow recovery in a hind limb ischemic model using BALB/c-nu mice.

Furthermore, treatment of mice bearing breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) with the humanized anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab repressed expression of genes associated with breast cancer stemness, reduced activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or BMI1, and impaired the capacity of breast cancer PDXs to metastasize or reengraft Rag2−/−γc−/− mice. Finally, treatment of PDX-bearing mice with cirmtuzumab and paclitaxel was more effective than treatment with either alone in eradicating breast cancer PDXs. These results indicate"

We show that the start of accelerated deglaciation was preceded by a volcanic eruption of Mount Takahe, which led to stratospheric ozone depletion and marked climate changes. These changes are consistent with a poleward shift of the Southern Hemisphere westerlies, similar to those associated with modern ozone depletion over Antarctica. This finding provides a unique link between the start of accelerated deglaciation and the Mount Takahe eruption, and it challenges the widely held view that the start of accelerated deglaciation was caused by a sudden poleward shift in the Southern Hemisphere westerlies. This finding also suggests that the start of accelerated deglaciation may have been caused by a natural event, and it provides a link between the start of deglaciation and the recovery of the Southern Hemisphere climate.

However, they are often overlooked in global assessments of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Here, we provide a global map of riverine fisheries, which reveals that 90% of global catch comes from river basins with above-average stress levels. We also find that inland fisheries provide the equivalent of all dietary animal protein for 158 million people, highlighting the critical role of rivers in providing locally sourced, low-cost protein. At the same time, intensive fishing in regions where rivers are already degraded by other stressors may undermine efforts to conserve biodiversity. This syndrome of poverty, nutritional deficiency, fishery dependence, and extrinsic threats to biodiverse river ecosystems underscores the high stakes for improving fishery management. Our enhanced spatial data on estimated catches can facilitate the inclusion of inland fisheries in environmental planning to protect both food security and species diversity."

Here, we show that the dominant component of metabolic fluctuations in the resting brain is topographically similar to the default mode network (DMN), a network of regions that is thought to be inactive during conscious awareness. In Parkinson’s disease, the DMN-like dominant component of metabolic fluctuations is subordinated to a disease-related pattern. Network functionality was assessed by quantifying metabolic fluctuations in the dominant component of the resting brain. Network deactivation was reduced in early Parkinson’s disease, and this abnormality was partially corrected by dopaminergic therapy. Time-course comparisons of DMN loss in longitudinal resting metabolic scans from Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease subjects illustrated that significant reductions appeared later for Parkinson’s disease, in parallel with the development of cognitive dysfunction. In contrast, in Alzheimer’s disease, significant reductions in network expression were already present at diagnosis, progressing over time.

However, the role of FSIP1 in the progression and drug sensitivity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

However, these factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. First, more diverse communities have a greater chance of including species with thermal traits that enable them to maintain productivity as temperatures shift from ambient conditions. Second, we found a pronounced increase in the contribution of complementarity to the net biodiversity effect at high and low temperatures, indicating that changes in species interactions played a critical role in mediating the impacts of temperature change on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function.

One of the major challenges in plant biology is the delivery of biomolecules to plants. This is a major hurdle in the development of plant-based therapeutics. Here, we demonstrate the delivery of siRNA to plants using DNA nanostructures. We show that the size, shape, compactness, stiffness, and location of the siRNA attachment locus on the DNA nanostructure are important design parameters for the delivery and gene silencing efficiency. This work establishes the feasibility of DNA nanostructures for the delivery of biomolecules to plants and also details the design parameters for the development of DNA nanostructures for plant cell internalization and gene silencing. This work will be useful for the development of plant-based therapeutics. This work also provides a platform for the development of DNA nanostructures for the delivery of biomolecules to other organisms."

However, most monitoring and regulatory efforts have focused on large rivers and lakes, leaving small streams largely unaddressed. We show that small streams can be important sources of nutrients to coastal ecosystems, especially in large lakes. We also show that small streams can be important sources of nutrients to coastal ecosystems, especially in large lakes. Although they represent only a modest proportion of lake-wide loads, expanding nutrient management efforts to address smaller watersheds could reduce the ecological impacts of nutrient loading on valuable nearshore ecosystems.

Here, we study a simple model of a chemical network in a thermodynamic environment that is biased toward rare combinations of chemical concentrations. We find that the long-time dynamics of such systems are biased toward states that exhibit a fine-tuned extremization of environmental forcing. This finding has implications for the design of catalytic networks in the far-from-equilibrium regime. It also suggests that the design of catalytic networks may be more difficult than previously thought. Finally, it may have implications for the design of catalytic processes in the real world."

Here we show that NMDAR-Abs can alter the dynamics of cortical microcircuits, leading to changes in the spectral composition of spontaneous EEG activity. We also show that these changes can be predicted by a dynamic causal model of the microcircuitry. These findings offer mechanistic insights into the circuit-level dysfunction induced by NMDAR-Abs. They also provide a framework for understanding the effects of other types of encephalitis on the EEG. This may lead to the development of biomarkers and treatments for this devastating disease.

However, the history of abrupt warming events is poorly understood because of the lack of proxy records that span the entire geological time. Here, we present a case study of an abrupt warming event that occurred during a glacial period. We show that the event was linked to a global-scale organic matter–derived carbon (C) perturbation and anoxia of the deep ocean. The event was also linked to a doubling of atmospheric CO2, which is a key factor in the evolution of the Earth system. Our results highlight the importance of organic matter in the Earth system and the potential for organic matter-derived carbon to trigger abrupt warming events.

Despite its popularity, the impact of RSPO certification on tropical deforestation remains unclear. We use a unique dataset of oil palm plantations in Indonesia to evaluate the impact of RSPO certification on deforestation and fire. We find that RSPO certification reduced deforestation by 33% from 9.8 to 6.6% y−1. However, certification had no causal impact on deforestation in peatlands or active fire detection. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results highlight the importance of certification in forested regions and the need for certification to be tightly linked to the protection of remaining forests. These findings have implications for the future of sustainability certification in the palm oil sector."

It is essential to organisms across kingdoms. In humans, its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. The exocyst complex is difficult to study in humans because of its essential role in cell physiology. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and offers a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

In vertebrates, sex is determined by a single locus, resulting in two sexes. In species with multiple sex determination alleles, however, the sex of an individual can be determined by multiple alleles. Here we investigate the effects of multiple sex determination alleles on the secondary sexual characteristics of a fish species. We find that multiple sex determination alleles can produce modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics, and that the introgression of a new sex determination allele can produce even more variation. These results have implications for understanding the evolution and maintenance of sex determination alleles. They also have implications for understanding the evolution of sex-linked traits, which are common in humans and other mammals."

However, the evolution of new prey niches is often associated with morphological changes throughout the body of the predator. This is particularly true for predators that capture prey with specialized structures, such as the tentacles of siphonophores. Here we show that siphonophore tentacles have strong evolutionary associations with prey type, and that these associations are linked to the evolution of the tentacles. Our findings help to understand how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs. They also provide a new perspective on the evolution of predator specialization and diversification."

This provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key shared derived characteristic of modern human and Neandertal hand morphology and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo.

The increase in the weight of farm machinery has led to the propagation of subsoil compaction into deeper soil layers, with potential loss of soil productivity. We show that the total area of the world with subsoil compaction susceptibility is now 20% of arable land, and that this trend is likely to continue. We hypothesize that the large size of sauropods, the largest terrestrial animals that walked Earth, may have been a response to the need to minimize the adverse effects of subsoil compaction on food production. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the largest sauropods, the brachiosaurs, had the largest body size, and that the largest body size was correlated with the largest foraging range. Our results suggest that the evolution of sauropods may have been driven by the need to minimize the adverse effects of subsoil compaction on food production.
