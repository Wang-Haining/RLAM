In this paper, we provide a purely categorical approach to the foundations of quantum theory. Our approach is based on the observation that the category of Hilbert spaces and bounded operators has a monoidal structure, and that the category of Hilbert spaces and adjointable operators has a dual monoidal structure. We use these structures to define a notion of functor between categories of states, and to prove that the category of Hilbert spaces and adjointable operators has a full and faithful subcategory of continuous states, which is closed under retracts and has a dual. This subcategory is equivalent to the category of continuous states, and hence the category of Hilbert spaces and bounded operators, and thus quantum theory, is categorical."

Here, we present the first genomic and transcriptomic analyses of two species of myxozoans, which represent the most distant members of the group. Our results show that myxozoans are cnidarians and are a sister group to the more complex group of animals that includes the parasitic group, the Ctenophora, and the free-living group, the Cnidaria. Our analyses also reveal that myxozoans are one of the most reduced animal groups, with a small genome and a reduced gene content. This extreme reduction in gene content is likely to have occurred during the evolution of the parasitic lifestyle."

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are critical for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We found that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a mechanism of viral antagonism that could be used for the development of antiviral strategies. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

This study shows that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the variability of maize yields will increase substantially under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. This higher variability will increase the probability of simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year in the world’s major maize-exporting countries, which account for 87% of global maize exports. This will increase the instability of global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. Our results underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance. This is an urgent and important message for the global community."

The effective CPUE of most countries in 2015 was a fifth of its 1950s value, which was compared with a global decline in abundance. There are signs, however, of stabilization and more effective management in recent years, with a reduction in fleet sizes in developed countries. Based on historical patterns and allowing for the slowing rate of expansion, 1 million more motorized vessels could join the global fleet by midcentury as developing countries continue to transition away from subsistence fisheries, challenging sustainable use of fisheries' resources.

This is a major finding because it suggests that the increase in reproductive output in domestic animals is not due to an increase in resource availability, but rather an increase in the mother’s metabolic power.

We show that the NWFP has not yet succeeded in reversing the decline of older forest-associated bird species. The NWFP has halted clearcutting on federal land, but this has not yet been sufficient to reverse declines in older-forest–associated bird populations. We also show that the early-seral ecosystem area has stabilized, but declined in two ecoregions, and early-seral bird populations declined. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure. The NWFP is a model for how science can inform policy, and we hope that this study will contribute to the ongoing efforts to improve forest management in the Pacific Northwest."

This problem can be addressed by the development of new antibacterial agents to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. Computational approaches are essential tools to this end since their application enables fast and early strategical decisions in the drug development process. Here, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. This work is a step forward in the development of new antibiotics. (Abridged)"

We report a large-scale experiment (n = 543) that investigates the CCE of technology (paper planes and their flight distances) using a transmission-chain design. Population size was manipulated such that participants could learn from the paper planes constructed by one, two, or four models from the prior generation. These social-learning conditions were compared with an asocial individual-learning condition in which individual participants made repeated attempts at constructing a paper plane, without having access to any planes produced by other participants. Larger populations generated greater variation in plane performance and gave participants access to better-adapted planes, but this did not enhance cumulative cultural evolution. In fact, there was an inverse relationship between population size and cumulative cultural evolution.

The HSRL is able to simultaneously measure aerosol and cloud properties, especially cloud microphysical properties. We demonstrate the scientific potential of the HSRL to investigate ACI processes. The observations obtained from the HSRL constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI process. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI. This paper is expected to be a significant contribution to the ACI community."

The temperature inferred from isotopic evidence is lower than the average surface temperature of the present, but the reliability of this estimate has been questioned. Here, we use the thermostability of reconstructed ancestral enzymes to estimate the paleotemperature of ancient organisms. Our results suggest that the surface temperature of the early Earth decreased over time, consistent with previous estimates. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that the origin of life was preceded by the evolution of the necessary biochemical machinery, and it provides a new approach for estimating the temperature history of the early Earth."

K+ channels commonly possess two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We hypothesized that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We induced C-type inactivation in BK channels and studied the relationship between activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery. We observed prominent slow C-type inactivation/recovery in BK channels by an extreme low concentration of extracellular K+ together with a Y294E/K/Q/S or Y279F mutation whose equivalent in Shaker channels (T449E/K/D/Q/S or W434F) caused a greatly accelerated rate of C-type inactivation or constitutive C-inactivation.

We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions.

Pathogen-agnostic NGS investigation of febrile persons in resource-scarce settings is feasible and revealing of a diverse pathogen landscape. Coordinated and ongoing pathogen surveillance can better identify the breadth of endemic, zoonotic, or emerging pathogens and deployment of rapid public health response. This approach can be used to rapidly identify pathogens responsible for undifferentiated febrile illness in resource-scarce settings."

However, the mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. Here, we show that the squid Euprymna scolopes regulates the provision of a single glycan to its symbiotic bacterium, Vibrio fischeri, at a specific time of day. This glycan is catabolized by the symbiont, which uses the resulting metabolites to maintain a stable symbiosis. This glycan-provisioning rhythm is established only after the squid has reached sexual maturity, suggesting that it is a critical factor in the establishment of the symbiosis. This study provides a new perspective on the regulation of symbiosis, in which the host provides a single nutrient at a specific time of day, and the symbiont uses this nutrient to maintain a stable symbiosis. This strategy may be used by other animal hosts to regulate the activities of their associated microbes."

Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation. These results demonstrate that the translation and base-pairing functions compete. This is an example of a dual-function RNA that is both “noncoding” and regulatory."

We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

We also show that this strategy is effective in B-cell lines, but uniquely effective in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a disease of the same type. Thus, we have identified a metabolic vulnerability of cancer cells, and a strategy to exploit it. This work has implications for the treatment of cancer, and for the study of one-carbon metabolism."

The disease is heterogeneous, with different genetic mutations leading to different clinical phenotypes. Here, we show that the proteins that are colocalized with mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), TDP-43, and FUS in motor neurons are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. Rather, the inclusion bodies that contain these proteins are supersaturated even more than the native interaction partners, suggesting that the presence of coaggregating proteins in ALS is a general phenomenon. This metastable state of the inclusion bodies may be a consequence of a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in motor neurons, leading to the formation of inclusions. Our results suggest that the pathogenesis of ALS is more complex than previously thought. (Show more)"

The device configuration also enables application of optical tweezers for controlled placement of atoms. The photonic crystal devices can be fabricated reliably from a 200-nm silicon nitride device layer using a lithography-based process, producing predicted optical properties in transmission and reflection measurements. These 2D photonic crystal devices can be readily deployed to experiments for many-body physics with neutral atoms and engineering of exotic quantum matter.

In the United States, the economic and ecological costs of wildfire have risen substantially in recent decades. Although climate change has likely enabled a portion of the increase in wildfire activity, the direct role of people in increasing wildfire activity has been largely overlooked. We show that humans have vastly expanded the spatial and seasonal “fire niche” in the United States, accounting for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. Human-caused wildfires disproportionally occurred where fuel moisture was higher than lightning-caused fires, thereby helping expand the geographic and seasonal niche of wildfire. Actions to raise awareness and increase management in regions prone to human-started wildfires should be a focus of United States policy to reduce fire risk and associated hazards. This work highlights the importance of understanding the role of human activities in driving changes in fire regimes."

Within this system, we identify a unique formation of striosomal neurons that project to dopamine-containing dendrites and clusters of their parent nigral cell bodies. These clusters of cells likely represent specialized integrative units within the system. Given the role of striosomes in mood and motivation, the striosome–dendron bouquets could be critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease. This work provides a detailed view of the dopamine system in the brain and its relationship to nigral cell bodies. It also provides a model for the study of the organization of the brain."

We asked pairs of friends and strangers to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

The SAN is a highly coordinated system that is able to adjust heart rate to meet hemodynamic demand. Here, we report that stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is a key regulator of the SAN. We show that STIM1 is expressed in the specialized cardiomyocytes of the SAN, and that its deletion in mice results in a reduction in the content of Ca2+ stores in these cells. This, in turn, leads to a reduction in the number of Ca2+ sparks, which are the events that occur in the plasma membrane of the cardiomyocyte and are essential for the generation of the electrical impulse. These results reveal a previously unknown role for STIM1 in the SAN. (Show more)"

However, the effect of certification on deforestation in oil palm plantations remains unclear. Here, we show that certification is associated with reduced deforestation in Indonesia, the leading producer of palm oil. Certification appears to be most effective in reducing deforestation in oil palm plantations that are already degraded and contain little residual forest. Nevertheless, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation."

Here we show that the third metacarpal styloid process, a key derived feature of the human hand, was present ∼1.42 Mya in an East African hominin from Kaitio, West Turkana, Kenya. This fossil thus provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key shared derived characteristic of modern human and Neandertal hand morphology and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato.

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show here that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the largest sauropods, the brachiosaurids, had the longest foraging trails. Our findings have implications for the design of farm machinery and the evolution of sauropod locomotion. (Abridged)"
