In this work, we report the structure of ice II-structured hydrate, which is a new phase of water. The structure of the hydrate is determined by in situ neutron diffraction at 480 MPa and temperatures ranging from 260 to 70 K. The guest atoms are enclathrated in the water molecules to form ice II-structured hydrates. The guest atoms have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The resolved structure is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. The structure of the hydrate is expected to be useful for understanding the structure of ice II. The enclathration of guest atoms in the host molecules is a common phenomenon in nature, and the structure of the hydrate may be useful for understanding the structure of ice II. This work also demonstrates that the structure of ice II-structured hydrates can be determined by in situ neutron diffraction. This technique is expected to be useful for studying the structure of ice II in the future"

The evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been enigmatic, and a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species and a cnidarian parasite. Our results show that the myxozoan body plan is reduced to the essential elements required for parasitism. We also show that the myxozoan genome is one of the smallest reported in animals. These results provide insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic cnidarian. (Read more)"

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2 in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes. We found that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the host immune response and may help in the development of new antiviral strategies. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of proton channels, but the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels is not completely understood. Here, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

We use global datasets of maize production and climate variability combined with future temperature projections to quantify how yield variability will change in the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. We find that as the global mean temperature increases, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation (CV) of maize yields increases almost everywhere to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields. For the top four maize-exporting countries, which account for 87% of global maize exports, the probability that they have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because species-level identification of food plants is prohibitively difficult with traditional methods. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large herbivores in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results highlight the importance of diet composition in determining the extent to which species partition food resources. This is especially important in the context of climate change, which is expected to alter the abundance and distribution of plant resources. Our results suggest that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized."

However, the global load of floating plastic debris is still unknown. We show that the global load of floating plastic debris is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This discrepancy is explained by the selective removal of small plastic fragments by the ocean interior. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

IGF2BP1 is expressed in adult bone marrow and fetal liver, but not in erythroid tissues. In erythroid cells, IGF2BP1 expression causes a reversal of the adult hemoglobin expression pattern toward a more fetal-like phenotype. This is achieved by increased gamma-globin combined with decreased beta-globin transcripts resulting in gamma-globin rising to 90% of total beta-like mRNA. Delta-globin mRNA is reduced to barely detectable levels. Fetal hemoglobin achieved levels of 68.6 ± 3.9% in the IGF2BP1 overexpression samples compared with 5.0 ± 1.8% in donor matched transduction controls.

This resistance is mediated by the activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. In addition, we show that the combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction shows therapeutic promise in preclinical models. These findings suggest that ferroptosis may be a promising treatment for cancer with PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway mutation. (truncated)"

We present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best candidate is synthetically more accessible, exhibits higher solubility and binding affinity to the ribosome, and is up to 56 times more active against resistant pathogens than telithromycin. Notably, the best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

Using Bayesian inference, we found that this model fits mortality curves from nine outbreaks in Europe better than models for pneumonic or rodent transmission. Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death. This has implications for our understanding of the history of plague in Europe and the evolution of plague control measures. Our model can be used to study the historical spread of plague in Europe and to explore the impact of vector control measures. This is relevant for the current COVID-19 pandemic, as the spread of the disease depends on the interaction between humans and vectors."

However, the utility of current TRAP1 inhibitors as probes of TRAP1 function is questionable because they cannot distinguish between TRAP1 and HSP90, the primary target of these inhibitors. We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. These findings also suggest that TRAP1-specific inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of cancer. This"

However, how it does so in a physiological context, where filaments are interconnected and under mechanical stress, remains unclear. Here, we monitor and quantify the action of ADF in different mechanical situations by using single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques, coupled to microfluidics. We find that local curvature favors severing, while tension surprisingly has no effect on ADF binding and weakly enhances severing. Remarkably, we observe that filament segments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist, experience a mechanical torque upon ADF binding. We find that this ADF-induced torque increases the severing rate constant 100-fold. A consequence of this mechanism is that cross-linked filament networks are severed by ADF far more efficiently than nonconnected filaments. We propose that this mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. This work provides a mechanistic explanation for how ADF, a protein that is involved in severing actin filaments, is able to do so in a physiological context.

We find that the presence of Ψ in the mRNA can slow translation, increase the rate of near-cognate amino acid incorporation, and increase the rate of peptide synthesis.

We use a combination of comparative phylogenetic analysis and the fossil record to examine the evolution of body size in aquatic mammals. We find that the evolution of an aquatic lifestyle is driving three of the four extant aquatic mammal clades toward a size attractor. The existence of this body size attractor and the relatively rapid selection toward, and limited deviation from, this attractor rule out most hypothesized drivers of size increase. These three independent body size increases and a shared aquatic optimum size are consistent with control by differences in the scaling of energetic intake and cost functions with body size between the terrestrial and aquatic realms. Water-dwelling mammals are driven and confined to larger body sizes by the strict energetic demands of the aquatic medium. Our results suggest that the evolution of aquatic lifestyles is a powerful driver of the evolution of body size in mammals."

Unexpectedly, this enzyme recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5′ termini, resulting in a one-nucleotide shift in substrate specificity. The unconventional manner in which RppH recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress.

Here, we show that housing mice in low humidity makes them more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that low humidity impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

In addition, as conceptualized, HM was associated with less trust in the government (Study 3), more sexism (Study 4), more racism (Study 5), and more xenophobia (Study 6) but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors.

One of the main rewards plants offer to pollinators for visitation is nectar. Nesocodon mauritianus (Campanulaceae) produces a blood-red nectar that has been proposed to serve as a visual attractant for pollinator visitation. Here, we show that the nectar’s red color is derived from a previously undescribed alkaloid termed nesocodin. The first nectar produced is acidic and pale yellow in color, but slowly becomes alkaline before taking on its characteristic red color. Three enzymes secreted into the nectar are either necessary or sufficient for pigment production, including a carbonic anhydrase that increases nectar pH, an aryl-alcohol oxidase that produces a pigment precursor, and a ferritin-like catalase that protects the pigment from degradation by hydrogen peroxide. Our findings identify a convergently evolved trait in two vertebrate-pollinated species, suggesting that the red pigment is selectively favored and that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation. This work also provides evidence for the presence of nesocodin in the red nectar of the distantly related and hummingbird-visited Jaltomata herrerae."

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. First, whereas MERS-CoV prefers human DPP4 over bat DPP4 as its receptor, HKU4 shows the opposite trend. Second, in the absence of exogenous proteases, both MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes mediate pseudovirus entry into bat cells, whereas only MERS-CoV spike, but not HKU4 spike, mediates pseudovirus entry into human cells.

The stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. Most of our understanding comes from Saccharomyces cerevisae where the extreme stability of the pol δ holoenzyme ensures that every nucleobase within an Okazaki fragment is faithfully duplicated before dissociation but also necessitates an active displacement mechanism for polymerase recycling and exchange. However, the human pol δ holoenzyme is unstable and dissociates rapidly from PCNA. Here, we show that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. Our results suggest that the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is a key determinant of lagging strand synthesis in humans.

The improved polymerase ribozyme is able to synthesize a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and, in low yield, even tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins.

Our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities. Our method can be used to measure the physical dynamics of cities in the future. This method can also be extended to measure the physical dynamics of other systems, such as the dynamics of social media.

We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals, but we did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides. These results suggest that ultrafine vellum does not necessarily derive from the use of abortive or newborn animals with ultrathin hides, but could equally well reflect a production process that allowed the skins of maturing animals of several species to be rendered into vellum of equal quality and fineness. This method could be used to identify the source of parchment used in other books and manuscripts. (Show more)"

The age model for the extinction is critical to understanding the causes and consequences of the event. We present a new age model for the extinction based on U-Pb dates from volcanic ash beds. The extinction occurred between 251.941 ± 0.037 and 251.880 ± 0.031 Mya, an interval of 60 ± 48 ka. Onset of a major reorganization of the carbon cycle immediately precedes the initiation of extinction and is punctuated by a sharp (3‰), short-lived negative spike in the isotopic composition of carbonate carbon. Carbon cycle volatility persists for ∼500 ka before a return to near preextinction values. Decamillenial to millennial level resolution of the mass extinction and its aftermath will permit a refined evaluation of the relative roles of rate-dependent processes contributing to the extinction. This will allow insight into postextinction ecosystem expansion, and establish an accurate time point for evaluating the plausibility of trigger and kill mechanisms. (Contains figures and tables.)"

RORαΔIEC mice exhibit excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs.

The NVDRS summarizes violent death incidents with structured variables and unstructured narratives. We identify 225 latent topics in the narratives (e.g., preparation for death and physical aggression); many of these topics are not captured by existing structured variables.

We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. These results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This approach may be applicable to other cancers that are associated with high levels of IL1RAP expression. (truncated)"

Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR).

Photosynthesis relies on these modified tetrapyrroles for the capture of solar radiation and its conversion to chemical energy. The formation of the isocyclic fifth ring, the key reaction in the biosynthesis of (bacterio)chlorophyll, has remained enigmatic for more than 60 y. This reaction is catalyzed by two unrelated cyclase enzymes using different chemistries. The majority of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria use BchE, an O2-sensitive [4Fe-4S] cluster protein, whereas plants, cyanobacteria, and some phototrophic bacteria possess an O2-dependent enzyme, the major catalytic component of which is a diiron protein, AcsF. Plant and cyanobacterial mutants in ycf54 display impaired function of the O2-dependent enzyme, accumulating the reaction substrate. Swapping cyclases between cyanobacteria and purple phototrophic bacteria reveals three classes of the O2-dependent enzyme. AcsF is the cyclase in Rvi. gelatinosus, whereas alphaproteobacterial cyclases require a newly discovered protein that we term BciE"

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. Our study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility in autism and suggests that forgetting is a potential therapeutic target for autism. This study also provides a model system to study the role of forgetting in behavior.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas the more rigid uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into"

We find that each oncogene has somewhat different surfaceomes, but the functions of these proteins are harmonized by common biological themes including up-regulation of nutrient transporters, down-regulation of adhesion molecules and tumor suppressing phosphatases, and alteration in immune modulators. These studies provide a broad systems-level view of how specific driver oncogenes remodel the surfaceome and the glycoproteome in a cell autologous fashion, and suggest possible surface targets, and combinations thereof, for drug and biomarker discovery.

We also show that this form of regeneration is linked to a well-studied form of endogenous activity-dependent ectopic axon outgrowth in the same neuron type. These findings suggest that this form of regeneration may be a powerful platform for gene discovery in neuronal regeneration.

In contrast, in Parkinson’s disease (PD), the dominant RSN is subordinated to a disease-related pattern. Network functionality was assessed by quantifying the expression of the RSNs in the brain during task performance.

However, the role of FSIP1 in the progression and drug sensitivity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. This article is protected by copyright.

Here we show that the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is sensitive to changes in temperature. We found that the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning becomes steeper as temperatures change from ambient conditions, indicating that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This result is driven by two processes linked to the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. First, more diverse communities have a greater chance of including species with thermal traits that enable them to maintain productivity as temperatures shift from ambient conditions. Second, we found a pronounced increase in the contribution of complementarity to the net biodiversity effect at high and low temperatures, indicating that changes in species interactions played a critical role in mediating the impacts of temperature change on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function.

But how do we know when two people are connected? We asked pairs of friends and strangers to talk with each other and rated their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners.

We validate a model of the microcircuitry of the brain and show that it can explain the effects of the antibodies on the brain’s microcircuitry. We then show that the same changes in the microcircuitry can cause seizures in a mouse model of the disease. These findings offer mechanistic insights into circuit-level dysfunction induced by the antibodies. Our findings may help in the development of new therapies for the disease.

The cause of this warming is still under debate, but it is likely to be related to the injection of large amounts of organic matter into the ocean. The organic matter is likely to have come from the burial of large amounts of biomass, which would have led to anoxia in the ocean. Our study shows that such an event can lead to a global warming and an extinction event."

Certification is the tool most used to fulfill these procurement policies, and around 20% of global palm oil production is certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). However, the effect of certification on deforestation in oil palm plantations remains unclear. Here, we use a comprehensive dataset of RSPO-certified and noncertified oil palm plantations in Indonesia, the leading producer of palm oil, as well as annual remotely sensed metrics of tree cover loss and fire occurrence, to evaluate the impact of certification on deforestation and fire from 2001 to 2015. Our results suggest that certification reduced deforestation in Indonesia. Nevertheless, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation."

In humans, its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. The exocyst complex is evolutionarily conserved, and its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. Investigation of the dynamic regulation of the exocyst-related processes using mutants in genetically tractable organisms such as Arabidopsis thaliana is limited by the lethality or the severity of phenotypes. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 (exocyst component of 70 kDa) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and offers a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

In vertebrates, sex is determined by a single locus, which can be male- or female-determining. In species with a single sex-determining locus, the sex of an individual is determined by the sex of the parent it inherits from. In species with multiple sex-determining alleles, the sex of an individual is determined by the sex of the alleles it inherits. Here we investigate the effects of multiple alleles on secondary sexual characteristics in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii. We find that multiple alleles can produce a modular interplay of sex linkage and sex limitation, resulting in a variety of secondary sexual characteristics. These results provide context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of the maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations. (Show more)"

We sought to understand how the levels of iron (Fe) in the retina impact the tissue, given that retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are also challenged by accumulations of vitamin A aldehyde adducts (lipofuscin) that photogenerate reactive oxygen species and photodecompose into damaging aldehyde- and dicarbonyl-bearing species. We found that Fe levels in the retina impact the levels of lipofuscin and the susceptibility of the tissue to oxidative damage. These findings have implications for the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in the elderly. They also suggest that Fe chelation may be a useful strategy for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration. (Funded by the National Eye Institute)."

However, the evolution of predatory specialization is often considered a dead end, as morphological and functional optimizations are expected to be lost during the evolution of separate structures. Here we show that siphonophores, a group of pelagic cnidarians, are an exception to this rule. We show that siphonophore specialization is modular, and that the evolution of tentilla is linked to prey type. Our findings help to understand how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs. They also suggest that the evolution of specialization may be more common than previously thought."

These features include the presence of a third metacarpal styloid process, the radial carpometacarpal joint, and the radial styloid process. The presence of these features in the Middle Pleistocene to recent human hand suggests that the evolution of the human hand was a long and complex process. The discovery of the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of the third metacarpal styloid process in a hominin provides insight into the timing and rate of evolution of this key feature of the human hand."

One-carbon units are critical for cell growth, and SHMT is strongly up-regulated in cancer. Here we show that dual knockout of SHMT1 and SHMT2 in mice blocks the growth of colon cancer xenografts. We also identify small-molecule dual inhibitors of SHMT1 and SHMT2. These inhibitors are effective in cell-lines, but paradoxically increase cytotoxicity in a cancer cell-line screen. We show that this effect is rooted in defective glycine uptake in DLBCL cell lines, rendering them uniquely dependent upon SHMT enzymatic activity to meet glycine demand. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of DLBCL. These findings suggest that dual SHMT inhibition may be a promising strategy for cancer treatment. The pyrazolopyran scaffold that we identify as a dual inhibitor of SHMT1/2 is a promising lead for this purpose. The cancer cell-line screen that we perform is a promising strategy for identifying other promising SHMT inhibitors. These findings also suggest that the one-carbon donor formate may"

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the largest sauropods had the highest compaction susceptibility."
