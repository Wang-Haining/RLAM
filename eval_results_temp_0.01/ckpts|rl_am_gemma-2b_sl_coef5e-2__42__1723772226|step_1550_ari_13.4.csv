Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1, but the molecular mechanism of this inhibition is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide"

We show that DNA metabarcoding can be used to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species in semiarid African savanna. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers, and grass consumption was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of % grass consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption, but dietary composition differed between all species—even pairs of size-matched grazers. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized."

The development of new antibiotics is a major challenge, and computational approaches are essential tools to this end. In this study, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. The predicted best candidate is synthetically more accessible, exhibits higher solubility and binding affinity to the ribosome, and is up to 56 times more active against resistant pathogens than telithromycin.

We show that the nucleation of the body-centered cubic phase of iron is much easier than that of the hexagonal close-packed phase, which is the stable phase of iron at the inner core conditions. This mechanism reduces the required undercooling of iron nucleation, which provides a key factor in solving the inner core nucleation paradox. The two-step nucleation scenario of the inner core also opens an avenue for understanding the structure and anisotropy of the present inner core.

Data from monitoring records and community surveys provide evidence about how the program may affect forest outcomes. Community members perceived that the program’s monitors were new authorities with influence over forest management and that the monitors’ incentivized patrols were substitutes for traditional, unincentivized citizen patrols that suffer from free riding and inhibit timely community detection of and responses to deforestation.

Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. We find that the wispy, wheel-shaped orb web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to capture the sound-induced air particle movements that approach the maximum physical efficiency better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By sensing the motion of web threads, the spider remotely detects and localizes the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave, such as those emitted by approaching prey or predators. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself. The spider also enables the flexibility to functionally adjust and regularly regenerate its external ""eardrum"" according to its needs.

These autism-risk genes all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility, which resulted from the inability to forget. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

In particular, the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis, which is the result of heat stress, is considered to be the most severe threat to coral reefs worldwide. We show that the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis is preceded by a shift in the metabolic balance of the coral host, which is driven by altered nutrient cycling. This shift is a consequence of the heat stress-induced increase in the metabolic energy demand of the coral host, which is compensated by the degradation of amino acids. The resulting shift from net uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont subsequently promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates.

The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) is the leading certification body, and its certification of palm oil plantations is often used as a proxy for the reduction of tropical deforestation. We show that RSPO certification is associated with a reduction in deforestation, but that the benefits are small and come at the cost of peat degradation. We also show that certification has no causal impact on active fire detection rates. Our results suggest that certification is not a viable tool for reducing tropical deforestation, and that the RSPO should focus on improving its standards and monitoring."

In this study, we investigate the effects of multiple interacting sex determination alleles on the evolution of secondary sexual characteristics. We find that the multiple alleles of a polygenic sex determination system can produce a modular system of sexual polymorphism, where the same trait can vary in different individuals, and the same individual can vary in different traits. This modular system of sexual polymorphism is a result of the interplay of sex linkage and sex limitation, and the modular system of sexual polymorphism is a result of the polygenic nature of sex determination."

The retina is also challenged by the accumulation of bisretinoids, which are oxidized by reactive oxygen species and photodegraded into reactive intermediates. We show that the intracellular level of iron impacts the oxidation and degradation of bisretinoids. These findings have implications for the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in the elderly. They also suggest that the level of iron may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of this disease. (Read more)"

We show that the risk of subsoil compaction has increased over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity. This alarming trend calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the discovery of a 100-m-long, 10-m-wide, and 1.5-m-deep trail in the sediments of the Morrison Formation in the American Southwest. This trail is interpreted as the footprint of a sauropod, and it is the largest known footprint of its kind. The discovery of this trail provides evidence for the potential"
