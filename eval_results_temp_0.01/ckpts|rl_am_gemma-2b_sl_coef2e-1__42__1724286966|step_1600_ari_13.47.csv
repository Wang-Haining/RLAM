However, the structure of ice II has been controversial because of the difficulty in obtaining the structure by diffraction methods. Here, we report the structure of ice II hydrate, which is a hydrate of neon. The neon atoms are enclathrated in water molecules to form ice II-structured hydrates. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. Molecular dynamics simulation confirms that the resolved structure where Ne dissolved in ice II is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. The density distributions indicate that the vibration of Ne atoms is mainly in planes perpendicular to D2O channels, whereas their distributions along the channels are further constrained by interactions between adjacent Ne atoms. This study provides a new understanding of the structure of ice II hydrates. It also provides a new strategy for the synthesis of ice II hydrates. This article is protected by copyright.

The evolutionary origin of the myxozoan body plan, which includes a distinctive structure, the polar capsule, that is similar to the stinging structures in cnidarians, has been elusive. Here, we present the first comparative genomic analysis of two distantly related myxozoan species and a cnidarian parasite. Our results show that the myxozoan genome is one of the smallest reported in animals and that the transition from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic myxozoan was accompanied by extreme reduction in gene content. These results provide insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Show more)"

The virus responsible for this pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been shown to evade the antiviral action of interferon (IFN) by blocking nuclear import of transcription factors that are essential for induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 uses a viral accessory protein, Orf6, to block nuclear import of transcription factors. We show that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain. We also show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its ability to antagonize the antiviral action of IFN. Our findings unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2 and may lead to the development of new antiviral strategies. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. Sperm cells are quiescent in the male reproductive system due to Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1 channels, but become active once introduced into the low-Zn2+-concentration environment of the female reproductive tract. How Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide"

Earlier studies suggest that once the optimum growing temperature is exceeded, mean crop yields decline and the variability of yield increases even if interannual climate variability remains unchanged. Here, we use global datasets of maize production and climate variability combined with future temperature projections to quantify how yield variability will change in the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. We find that as the global mean temperature increases, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation (CV) of maize yields increases almost everywhere to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation (SD) of yields and a decrease in mean yields. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. They also underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance. ("

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa in dietary samples. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammal species in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results highlight the importance of diet composition in understanding the structure and functioning of LMH communities. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

We found that the majority of the grains have ages of &lt;300 Ma, which is shorter than theoretical estimates for large grains. A minority of the grains have ages of &gt;1 Ga, which is longer than expected for large grains. We estimate that the majority of the grains acquired the bulk of their cosmogenic nuclides in the interstellar medium and not by exposure to an enhanced particle flux of the early active sun.

The most common drugs for treating hypertension are L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs). LCCBs are major drugs for treating hypertension, the preeminent risk factor for heart failure. Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) remodeling is a pathological hallmark of chronic hypertension. VSMC remodeling is characterized by molecular rewiring of the cellular Ca2+ signaling machinery, including down-regulation of Ca2+ channels and up-regulation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stromal-interacting molecule (STIM) Ca2+ sensor proteins and the plasma membrane ORAI Ca2+ channels. STIM/ORAI proteins mediate store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) and drive fibro-proliferative gene programs during cardiovascular remodeling. Here, we show that the three major classes of LCCBs activate STIM/ORAI-mediated Ca2+ entry in VSMCs. LCCBs act on the STIM N terminus to cause STIM relocalization to junctions and subsequent ORAI activation in a Cav1.2-independent and store depletion-independent manner. LCCB-induced promotion of VSMC remodeling requires ST"

We also show that the NWFP failed to halt the decline of early-seral–associated bird populations. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure.

The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice, and automatically adapts to different problems.

This was not fatal, but led to the development of autoantibodies against organ-specific antigens. CTLA-4 deletion induced preferential expansion of CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells, but this was not sufficient to prevent the development of autoimmunity. Moreover, CTLA-4 deletion had opposing effects on different autoimmune models. Thus, although CTLA-4 deficiency affected both central and peripheral tolerance, it was essential for the development of autoimmunity.

Phylogenomic analyses of these uniquely comprehensive datasets resolved previously controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, corresponding (Jurassic) diversification rate increases suggest that these novel genes triggered adaptive radiations that resulted in nearly half of all living beetle species. We propose that beetle diversity resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding plant-digesting enzymes. This study thus provides a new perspective on the evolution of beetles and their symbionts. (Show more)"

However, the evolution of brain power, which is the ability to process information, has been neglected. This study shows that the evolution of brain power is not only different from that of brain size but also has a different evolutionary trajectory. The evolution of brain power is characterized by four major shifts in the number of neurons. The most dramatic increases in brain neurons occurred with the appearance of birds and mammals, resulting in convergent neuron scaling in the two endothermic lineages. The other two major increases happened in core land birds and anthropoid primates, which are two groups known for their cognitive prowess."

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal and transformed cells is more complex than previously appreciated. We have shown that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor.

They are dynamic structures that can be assembled and disassembled. The disassembly process is controlled by the actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin family of proteins. These proteins are the central regulators of actin filament disassembly. Here, we study the action of ADF/cofilin in different mechanical situations. We find that local curvature favors severing, while tension has no effect on cofilin binding and weakly enhances severing. Remarkably, we observe that filament segments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist, experience a mechanical torque upon cofilin binding. We propose that this ADF/cofilin-induced torque increases the severing rate constant 100-fold. A consequence of this mechanism is that cross-linked filament networks are severed by cofilin far more efficiently than nonconnected filaments. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. This work provides a mechanistic explanation for the role of ADF/cofilin in cells. It also provides a general framework for understanding the action of other proteins that are involved in the disassembly of dynamic"

In this work, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. We find that when positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks.

The existence of this body size attractor and the relatively rapid selection toward, and limited deviation from, this attractor rule out most hypothesized drivers of size increase.

This peptide is highly dynamic and has a unique structure with one four-residue α-helix and one three-residue antiparallel β-sheet stabilized by two disulfide bonds. The antifungal activity of this peptide was also demonstrated. This work provides a structural basis for the antifungal activity of plant immune peptides and opens up the possibility of developing this class of peptides as a spray-on fungistat/fungicide.

However, the extent of molecular continuity between males and females is largely unknown. Here, we show that the Drosophila sperm proteome undergoes substantial compositional changes after being transferred to the female reproductive tract. Multiple seminal fluid proteins initially associate with sperm, but most become undetectable after sperm are stored. Female-derived proteins also begin to associate with sperm immediately after mating, and they comprise nearly 20% of the postmating sperm proteome following 4 d of storage in the female reproductive tract. Female-derived proteins that associate with sperm are enriched for processes associated with energy metabolism, suggesting that female contributions support sperm viability during the prolonged period between copulation and fertilization. Our research provides a comprehensive characterization of sperm proteome dynamics and expands our understanding of the critical process of sperm–FRT interactions. (Show more)"

Mutations in VWF cause the common bleeding disorder, von Willebrand disease (VWD). We show that force application switches VWF to a second state with faster on-rate, providing a mechanism for activating VWF binding to platelets. Switching occurs near 10 pN, a force that also induces a state of the receptor−ligand complex with slower off-rate. Force greatly increases the effects of VWD mutations, explaining pathophysiology. Conversion of single molecule kon (s−1) to bulk phase kon (s−1M−1) and the kon and koff values extrapolated to zero force for the low-force pathways show remarkably good agreement with bulk-phase measurements. This suggests that the low-force pathways are in the bulk phase. This is the first demonstration of a mechanism for activating VWF binding to platelets. It is also the first demonstration of a mechanism for activating a protein that binds to platelets. This mechanism may be relevant to other proteins that bind to platelets.

However, it is difficult to be well represented in current climate models. Progress on understanding ACI processes is hampered by inadequate observational capability. High-resolution and simultaneous observations of diurnal aerosol loading and cloud microphysical properties are challenging for current remote-sensing techniques. To overcome this conundrum, we introduce the dual-field-of-view (FOV) high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) for simultaneously profiling aerosol and water cloud properties, especially water cloud microphysical properties. This instrument is verified by the Monte Carlo simulation and coincident observations of other techniques. A case study over Beijing highlights the scientific potential of dual-FOV HSRL to become a significant contributor to the ACI investigations. The observed water cloud profiles identify that due to air entrainment its vertical structure is not perfectly adiabatic, as assumed by many current retrieval methods. These observations obtained from the dual-FOV HSRL constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI process. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

We found that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. These findings may help us understand the BK channel’s normal function and may provide a basis for the development of BK channel blockers. (Read more)"

Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

Globally, fossil-fuel-related emissions account for about 65% of the excess mortality, and 70% of the climate cooling by anthropogenic aerosols. The chemical influence of air pollution on aeolian dust contributes to the aerosol cooling. Since aerosols mask the anthropogenic rise in global temperature, removing fossil-fuel-generated particles liberates 0.51 °C and all pollution particles 0.73 °C warming, reaching around 2 °C over North America and Northeast Asia. The steep temperature increase from removing aerosols can be moderated to about 0.36 °C globally by the simultaneous reduction of tropospheric ozone and methane.

However, the management practices that can increase SOC storage in grassland-derived Mollisols remain uncertain. We show that soil health management practices that increase soil microbial biomass and diversity, such as incorporating legumes and applying manure, can increase SOC storage in annual cropping systems. However, these practices did not increase SOC storage in perennial pastures. These results highlight the importance of integrating livestock and perennial grasslands into agricultural systems to increase SOC storage in the long term. Our findings also highlight the importance of soil health management practices that increase microbial biomass and diversity in annual cropping systems. This article is protected by copyright.

The color of nectar is an important trait that attracts pollinators. In this study, we show that the red color of the nectar of Nesocodon mauritianus is derived from a previously undescribed alkaloid, nesocodin. We also identify this compound in the red nectar of the hummingbird-visited Jaltomata herrerae. We demonstrate that nesocodin is attractive to the vertebrate pollinator, Phelsuma geckos. This work identifies a convergently evolved trait in two vertebrate-pollinated species, suggesting that the red pigment is selectively favored and that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation. This work also provides a molecular basis for the evolution of red nectar. (Show more)"

However, the population history of Europe during the period between the migrations and the fall of the Roman Empire is poorly understood. Here we present a genome-wide analysis of a group of women from Bavaria, Germany, who had skull deformations that were surgically corrected in the 6th century AD. Our results indicate that these women had a genetic ancestry that is not typical for northern and central Europeans. In addition, we show that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago. These findings suggest that complex demographic processes during the Early Medieval period may have contributed in an unexpected way to shape the modern European genetic landscape.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. First, whereas MERS-CoV prefers human DPP4 over bat DPP4 as its receptor, HKU4 shows the opposite trend. Second, in the absence of exogenous proteases, both MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes mediate pseudovirus entry into bat cells, whereas only MERS-CoV spike, but not HKU4 spike, mediates pseudovirus entry into human cells.

The lagging strand template is replicated by DNA polymerase δ (pol δ) in a complex with the sliding clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). The stability of this complex is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. In this study, we developed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. We found that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the observed kinetic behavior of pol δ in human cells. They also suggest that the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme may be a key factor in the evolution of the human genome. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

Here, we generate intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific RORα-deficient (RORαΔIEC) mice and find that RORα is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis by attenuating nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcriptional activity. RORαΔIEC mice exhibit excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis reveals corecruitment of RORα and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) on NF-κB target promoters and subsequent dismissal of CREB binding protein (CBP) and bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) for transcriptional repression. Together, we demonstrate that RORα/HDAC3-mediated attenuation of NF-κB signaling controls the balance of inflammatory responses, and therapeutic strategies targeting this epigenetic regulation could be beneficial to"

The NVDRS summarizes violent death incidents with structured variables and unstructured narratives. We identify 225 latent topics in the narratives (e.g., preparation for death and physical aggression); many of these topics are not captured by existing structured variables. Motivated by known patterns in suicide and homicide by gender and recent research on gender biases in semantic space, we identify the gender bias of our topics (e.g., a topic about pain medication is feminine). We then compare the gender bias of topics to their prevalence in narratives of female versus male victims. Results provide a detailed quantitative picture of reporting about lethal violence and its gendered nature. Our method offers a flexible and broadly applicable approach to model topics in text data.

Despite advances in therapy, the prognosis of AML patients is poor, and there is an urgent need for novel and more efficient therapies. We show here that monoclonal antibodies targeting the IL1RAP (IL1R3) receptor, which is expressed on candidate leukemic stem cells in the majority of AML patients, but not on normal hematopoietic stem cells, have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This study provides a proof"

We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR).

Neuroinflammation is also known to be associated with autoimmune diseases, such as EAE. Neuroinflammation is a complex process that involves multiple cell types, including microglia, astrocytes, and neurons. In this study, we found that neuroinflammation was reduced in both the early and later stages of EAE in microglia/macrophage-specific ASK1 knockout mice, whereas only the later-stage neuroinflammation was ameliorated in astrocyte-specific ASK1 knockout mice. ASK1 signaling in microglia played a major role in generating and maintaining disease. Activated astrocytes produce key inflammatory mediators, including CCL2, that further activated and recruited microglia/macrophages, in an astrocytic ASK1-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that ASK1 is a promising therapeutic target for reducing neuroinflammation. These findings also suggest that ASK1 may be a phase-specific mediator of glial cell interactions in EAE pathophysiology. We propose glial ASK1 as a promising therapeutic target for reducing neuroinflammation. (PsycInfo Database Record"

The drought began in 2012 and now includes the lowest calendar-year and 12-mo precipitation, the highest annual temperature, and the most extreme drought indicators on record. The extremely warm and dry conditions have led to acute water shortages, groundwater overdraft, critically low streamflow, and enhanced wildfire risk. We find that precipitation deficits in California were more than twice as likely to yield drought years if they occurred when conditions were warm. We also find that although there has not been a substantial change in the probability of either negative or moderately negative precipitation anomalies in recent decades, the occurrence of drought years has been greater in the past two decades than in the preceding century. Finally, we conclude that anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of co-occurring warm–dry conditions like those that have created the acute human and ecosystem impacts associated with the “exceptional” 2012–2014 drought in California. Thus, anthropogenic warming is increasing the likelihood of the most extreme droughts in California. This conclusion is consistent with the findings of other studies."

The etiology of autism is so complicated because it involves the effects of variants of several hundred risk genes along with the contribution of environmental factors. Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. As an alternative approach, extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying the convergence of the targets and functions of the autism-risk genes to facilitate mapping out causal paths. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. Mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral deficits in"

However, our understanding of the factors that contribute to virus spillover from bats is very limited. Here, we identified and characterized an immunosuppressant protein (MTX) that is highly concentrated in the submandibular salivary gland of the bat, Myotis pilosus. By selectively inhibiting the epoxide hydrolase function of leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) to inhibit LTA4 hydrolysis and the generation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a potent lipid chemoattractant for host defense against infection, MTX inhibited the antiviral responses of the host and facilitated viral infection. MTX had no effect on the aminopeptidase function of LTA4H and therefore did not impair the antiinflammatory function of LTA4H.

Rather, the inclusions are composed of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. Our results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons. Thus, the presence of metastable proteins in inclusions may be a general feature of neurodegenerative diseases. (Show more)"

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas the more rigid uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into"

Here we apply quantitative proteomics of N-linked glycoproteins to reveal how a collection of some 700 surface proteins is dramatically remodeled in an isogenic breast epithelial cell line stably expressing any of six of the most prominent proliferative oncogenes, including the receptor tyrosine kinases, EGFR and HER2, and downstream signaling partners such as KRAS, BRAF, MEK, and AKT. We find that each oncogene has somewhat different surfaceomes, but the functions of these proteins are harmonized by common biological themes including up-regulation of nutrient transporters, down-regulation of adhesion molecules and tumor suppressing phosphatases, and alteration in immune modulators. Addition of a potent MEK inhibitor that blocks MAPK signaling brings each oncogene-induced surfaceome back to a common state reflecting the strong dependence of the oncogene on the MAPK pathway to propagate signaling. These studies provide a broad systems-level view of how specific driver oncogenes remodel the surfaceome and the glycoproteome in a cell autologous fashion, and suggest possible surface targets, and combinations thereof"

Here, we identify a form of regeneration that is remarkably independent of the MAPK signaling pathway, which is the major pathway mediating regeneration in the adult mammalian CNS. This form of regeneration is triggered by physical lesion of the sensory dendrite and is enhanced by reducing neuronal activity and elevating cAMP. These findings suggest that this form of regeneration may be a powerful platform for discovery of factors that control the adult nervous system’s intrinsic regenerative capacity. Moreover, this form of regeneration may be a useful model for studying the control of regeneration in the adult mammalian CNS."

It is essential for the maintenance of genetic diversity in populations and for the generation of genetic variation in the offspring of sexually reproducing organisms. In this paper, we describe the distribution of recombination across the genome of a flowering plant, Mimulus guttatus. We find that recombination rates vary widely across the genome, with some regions exhibiting no detectable recombination. We also find that recombination rates tend to peak near the start of genes and fall off sharply, exhibiting polarity. These results are similar to those observed in yeast and in positive-regulatory domain zinc finger protein 9–knockout mice, suggesting that recombination initiation described here in Mimulus may reflect ancient and conserved eukaryotic mechanisms.

This hypothesis has been validated in a variety of experimental paradigms. However, the RSN hypothesis has been difficult to test in clinical populations because of the lack of a reliable method to identify and validate RSNs. Here, we used metabolic positron emission tomography to identify and validate reproducible RSN topographies in healthy and disease populations. We found that the dominant RSN was topographically similar to the default mode network (DMN), whereas the subordinate RSN was topographically similar to the task-negative network (TRN). Network functionality was assessed by quantifying metabolic RSN expression in cerebral blood flow PET scans acquired at rest and during task performance. We found that the DMN was deactivated during rest in healthy subjects and early Parkinson’s disease patients, whereas the TRN was activated. In contrast, in advanced Parkinson’s disease, the DMN was activated. These results provide a method to identify and validate RSNs in clinical populations. They also provide a method to assess the functional significance of RSNs in health and disease."

However, the role of FSIP1 in the progression and drug sensitivity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. (Show more)"

The present study shows that some, but not all, alcohol-dependent subjects develop gut leakiness, which is associated with higher scores of depression, anxiety, and alcohol craving after 3 wk of abstinence. Moreover, subjects with increased gut permeability also had altered composition and activity of the gut microbiota. These results suggest the existence of a gut–brain axis in alcohol dependence, which implicates the gut microbiota as an actor in the gut barrier and in behavioral disorders. Thus, the gut microbiota seems to be a previously unidentified target in the management of alcohol dependence. © 2015, The Author(s). All rights reserved."

The flavor of tomato fruit is largely determined by the composition of the volatile organic compounds present in the fruit. These compounds are synthesized in the fruit, and the composition of the volatile profile is largely determined by the biosynthetic pathways of the volatile precursors. Here we report the identification of a gene essential for the biosynthesis of a large number of the volatile organic compounds in tomato fruit. This gene encodes a flavin-dependent monooxygenase, which catalyzes the sequential hydroxylation of a single nitrogen atom in the precursor molecule. This work provides a major step forward in understanding the biosynthesis of tomato fruit flavor. It also provides a model for the study of the biosynthesis of other nitrogenous volatile compounds in plants. (Show more)"

We show that the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is sensitive to changes in temperature. We find that the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning becomes steeper as temperatures deviate from ambient conditions, indicating that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This result is driven by two processes linked to the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. First, more diverse communities have a greater chance of including species with thermal traits that enable them to maintain productivity as temperatures shift from ambient conditions. Second, we find a pronounced increase in the contribution of complementarity to the net biodiversity effect at high and low temperatures, indicating that changes in species interactions play a critical role in mediating the impacts of temperature change on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function.

These findings offer mechanistic insights into circuit-level dysfunction induced by NMDAR-Ab.

Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results suggest that certification is not a silver bullet for reducing deforestation and fire in tropical landscapes. Rather, it is a tool that can be used in combination with other strategies to reduce deforestation. We hope that our findings will help inform the development of other certification schemes and policies. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

In this study, we discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

In many species, sex is determined by a single locus, resulting in two sexes. In species with multiple sex determination alleles, however, sex is determined by a polygenic process. Here we investigate the effects of polygenic sex determination in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii. We find that polygenic sex determination produces modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics, including genital morphology, craniofacial morphology, gastrointestinal morphology, and home tank behaviors. These results provide context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations. Understanding the evolution of sex determination is critical for understanding the evolution of sex differences in vertebrates. (Show more)"

We sought to understand how Fe levels impact the retina, given that retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are also challenged by accumulations of bisretinoids. We found that intracellular Fe promotes bisretinoid oxidation and degradation. This interpretation was supported by experiments showing that Fe chelation decreased the oxidative/degradation of the bisretinoid A2E in the presence of light and reduced cell death in cell-based experiments. Moreover, light-independent oxidation and degradation of A2E by Fenton chemistry products were evidenced by the consumption of A2E, release of dicarbonyls, and generation of oxidized A2E species in cell-free assays. These findings indicate that Fe is a key factor in the degradation of bisretinoids. Thus, Fe chelation may be a useful strategy to protect the retina from the damaging effects of bisretinoids. This interpretation is supported by the observation that Fe chelation decreased the oxidative/degradation of A2E in the presence of light and reduced cell death in cell"

However, the evolution of specialization is often considered a dead end, due to the constraints associated with the evolution of morphological and functional optimizations throughout the organism. Here we show that siphonophores, a group of pelagic predators, can evolve into generalists, and that specialists on one prey type have evolved into specialists on other prey types. Our findings suggest that shifts between prey types are linked to shifts in the morphology, mode of evolution, and evolutionary correlations of tentilla and their nematocysts. These findings contribute to understanding how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs."

Despite the wealth of information available from the fossil record, fundamental questions remain about the evolution of the human hand. Here we report the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key derived feature of the human hand, the third metacarpal styloid process. This fossil provides the earliest evidence for the evolution of a key derived characteristic of the modern human hand and suggests that the complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo. This study also provides a new perspective on the evolution of the human hand in the context of the evolution of the genus Homo. (Show more)"

One of the key metabolic pathways that supports cell growth is the one-carbon unit pathway, which is supported by the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). SHMT is a promising target for cancer therapy, but its clinical development has been hampered by the lack of small-molecule inhibitors. Here we report the discovery of a series of small-molecule dual inhibitors of SHMT1 and SHMT2. We also report a cell-line screen that reveals that SHMT inhibition is particularly effective in B-cell lines. Finally, we report a mechanism of SHMT inhibition that is unique to lymphoma cell lines. These findings provide a platform for the development of SHMT inhibitors for cancer therapy. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Agricultural intensification is a key strategy to address these challenges, but little consideration is given to the role of natural landscapes such as forests in meeting nutrition goals. In this study, we show that deforestation can reduce people’s diets and vitamin A adequacy, and that forest fragmentation can increase people’s diets and vitamin A adequacy. These findings have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. Our results suggest that strategies to improve nutrition should consider the role of natural landscapes in meeting these goals. This study also highlights the importance of using causal inference methods to test the impact of deforestation on people’s diets. This approach can be used to test the impact of other environmental interventions on people’s diets."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the largest dinosaurs, the sauropods, had a much higher prevalence of fixed foraging trails than other groups of dinosaurs. Our findings have important implications for the study of the evolution of animal behavior and the role of ecological factors in the development of modern agricultural practices. They also suggest that the effects of mechanization on soil ecology may have been similar to those of the dinosaurs. This hypothesis needs to be tested in future research. (Show more)"
