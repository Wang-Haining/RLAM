However, the origin of this group has remained elusive. Here, we present the first genomic and transcriptomic analyses of two distantly related myxozoans, Kudoa iwatai and Myxobolus cerebralis, and compare these to the transcriptome and genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results show that myxozoans are cnidarians and are a sister group to P. hydriforme. In addition, we find that myxozoans have one of the smallest reported animal genomes and that gene content and expression are reduced relative to other parasitic and nonparasitic cnidarians. These results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This is likely a consequence of the parasitic lifestyle, which requires a small genome and a reduction in gene content to minimize the metabolic burden on the host. This study provides insight into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic cnidarian. (Read more)"

One of the hallmarks of this disease is the dysregulation of the immune system, which leads to a severe cytokine storm. The immune system response is mediated by the interferon (IFN) pathway, which is essential for the antiviral response. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of proton channels, but the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels is not completely understood. Here, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

However, the extent to which LMH partition food resources is largely unknown because of the difficulty of species-level identification of plant remains in dung. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven LMH species in semiarid African savanna. Our results show that LMH are highly specialized in their consumption of food plants, and that diet composition differs between species even when they are similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.

However, the global load of floating plastic debris is still unknown. We show that the global load of floating plastic debris is far less than expected, mostly due to size-selective sinks. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean.

The effective CPUE of most countries in 2015 was a fifth of its 1950s value, which was compared with a global decline in abundance. There are signs, however, of stabilization and more effective management in recent years, with a reduction in fleet sizes in developed countries. The global fleet could expand by 1 million more motorized vessels by midcentury as developing countries continue to transition away from subsistence fisheries.

The cytopathological hallmark of MSA is the accumulation of α-syn aggregates in affected oligodendrocytes. We show here that the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765, which is currently in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of epilepsy, is able to limit the progressive toxicity of α-syn aggregation in a mouse model of MSA. This effect was associated with a reduction of truncated α-syn and its monomeric and oligomeric forms. Finally, VX-765 showed neuroprotective effects by preserving tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in the substantia nigra of MSA mice. In conclusion, our results suggest that VX-765, a drug that was well tolerated in a 6 wk-long phase II trial in patients with epilepsy, is a promising candidate to achieve disease modification in synucleinopathies by limiting α-syn accumulation.

LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM1-mediated ORAI1 activation. Our findings indicate that LCCBs may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of heart failure. Our data also indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated.

However, the evolution of brain power, which is the product of both size and number of neurons, has been largely neglected. This study provides a comprehensive reconstruction of the evolution of brain power across amniotes. We show that the evolution of brain power is characterized by four major shifts. The most dramatic increase in brain power happened with the origin of birds and mammals. This is a result of convergent evolution in these two endothermic lineages. The other three increases in brain power happened in core land birds and anthropoid primates. We discuss the implications of our findings for studies using relative brain size as a proxy when looking for evolutionary drivers of animal cognition. Our results also have implications for the evolution of human intelligence."

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal cells is not well understood. Here, we show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. Thus, TRAP1 may be a promising target for cancer therapy. (Read more)"

They are dynamic, and their structure and function are regulated by a number of proteins. One of these proteins, cofilin, is responsible for severing actin filaments. However, the mechanism by which cofilin does so is not well understood. Here, we show that the mechanical properties of the actin filament network in which cofilin acts play a critical role in determining the severing rate constant. We propose a mechanochemical model that explains our results. This model may be relevant to the function of cofilin in cells. Our findings may also have implications for the design of materials. For example, we show that the mechanical properties of the network in which cofilin acts can be used to tune the severing rate constant. This may be useful in the design of materials that are robust to mechanical stress. (Read more)"

In this study, we show that ingestion of fructose relative to glucose results in greater brain activation in regions involved in attention and reward processing and promotes greater hunger and desire for food and a willingness to give up long-term monetary rewards to obtain immediate high-calorie foods. These findings suggest that fructose may be a stronger stimulus for feeding behavior than glucose. Thus, the health benefits of fructose may be more modest than previously thought.

The island is located ∼400 km from the east coast of Africa, but its genetic and linguistic traits are from both Southeast Asia and Eastern Africa. We used a grid-based approach to sample at high resolution the genomic diversity across Madagascar. We find a common Bantu and Austronesian descent for all Malagasy individuals. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. This study provides a comprehensive picture of the human history of Madagascar. It also provides a reference for the genomic diversity of the Malagasy people, which is a unique population.

However, there is a growing appreciation that mRNAs can also be posttranscriptionally modified, and that these modifications can have profound effects on protein synthesis. Here, we show that the presence of a common modification, pseudouridine (Ψ), in mRNA coding regions can modestly alter both translation speed and mRNA decoding. Our results suggest that the ribosome can encounter Ψ in mRNA coding regions and that this can have a small effect on translation. This is an important finding, as the vast majority of Ψ moieties in mRNAs are found in coding regions.

However, the structural basis for their antifungal activity is not well understood. Here, we report the structure and antifungal activity of a unique NCR peptide from Medicago truncatula. The structure of the peptide was largely disordered and dynamic. However, it exhibited potent fungicidal activity against multiple plant fungal pathogens. The mode of action of the peptide was revealed by structural and functional studies. The peptide bound to multiple bioactive phosphoinositides in vitro and induced reactive oxygen species in germlings of the fungal pathogen. The peptide also exhibited strong fungal cell wall binding and penetration of the cell membrane at discrete foci, followed by gradual loss of turgor, subsequent accumulation in the cytoplasm, and elevated levels in nucleoli of germlings. The results provide insights into the structural basis of the antifungal activity of the NCR peptide. This work also paves the way for future development of this class of peptides as a spray-on fungistat/fungicide. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Inactivation gates are commonly composed of two parts, an intracellular part for fast channel activation/deactivation and an extracellular part for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. We found that BK channels, which are normally open, show a unique form of C-type inactivation that is closed state-dependent.

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, we found that women’s and men’s endorsement of hegemonic masculinity predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. In addition, as conceptualized, hegemonic masculinity predicted less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors.

However, the efficacy of soil health management practices in annual cropping systems on the North American Great Plains has not been well-characterized. We show that soil health management practices that reduce soil disturbance, diversify crop rotations, and integrate livestock can increase SOC storage and mineral-associated SOC in the top 15 cm of soil. These practices also enhance soil microbial biomass and C-use efficiency, but do not significantly increase the accumulation of mineral-bound microbial biomass. These results highlight the potential of well-managed grasslands to sequester SOC on North American agricultural soils. This study also highlights the importance of soil microbial traits in determining the efficacy of soil health management practices in annual cropping systems. Our findings provide a framework for the development of soil health management practices that can be used to mitigate climate change and improve soil health on agricultural lands worldwide.

We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4.

We connect changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods with economic and demographic data and find that three factors predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

Our projections indicate that the Black and Latino populations are estimated to experience declines in life expectancy at birth of 2.10 and 3.05 y, respectively, both of which are several times the 0.68-y reduction for Whites. Latinos, who have consistently experienced lower mortality than Whites, would see their more than 3-y survival advantage reduced to less than 1 y. These projections imply an increase of nearly 40% in the Black−White life expectancy gap, from 3.6 y to over 5 y, thereby eliminating progress made in reducing this differential since 2006.

It is also a major source of greenhouse gases and air pollution. We quantify the effects of climate, socioeconomic, and fire management on global fire activity and carbon emissions. We find that changes in human demography tend to suppress global fire activity, keeping more carbon within terrestrial ecosystems and attenuating warming. Our results highlight the importance of fire in the climate system and the need to manage fire in a way that minimizes the risk of more extreme fires. This is especially important in fire-dependent ecosystems, such as tropical forests, where fire suppression has led to a buildup of fuel and a risk of catastrophic fires. Our study also highlights the importance of active fire management in reducing emissions and the risk of more extreme fires. Our results suggest that fire management can be a powerful tool in climate mitigation. However, the effectiveness of fire management depends on the fire regime and the risk of more extreme fires.

This pandemic is generally understood as the consequence of a singular introduction of Yersinia pestis, after which the disease established itself in European rodents over four centuries. To locate these putative plague reservoirs, we studied the climate fluctuations that preceded regional plague epidemics, based on a dataset of 7,711 georeferenced historical plague outbreaks and 15 annually resolved tree-ring records from Europe and Asia.

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

The drought began in 2012 and now includes the lowest calendar-year and 12-mo precipitation, the highest annual temperature, and the most extreme drought indicators on record. The extremely warm and dry conditions have led to acute water shortages, groundwater overdraft, critically low streamflow, and enhanced wildfire risk. We find that precipitation deficits in California were more than twice as likely to yield drought years if they occurred when conditions were warm. We also find that although there has not been a substantial change in the probability of either negative or moderately negative precipitation anomalies in recent decades, the occurrence of drought years has been greater in the past two decades than in the preceding century. In addition, the probability that precipitation deficits co-occur with warm conditions and the probability that precipitation deficits produce drought have both increased. We conclude that anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of co-occurring warm–dry conditions like those that have created the acute human and ecosystem impacts associated with the “exceptional” 2012–2014 drought in California."

Therefore, it is difficult to identify the causal pathways that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility in autism and suggest that the activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting is a common mechanism for autism-risk genes. This study also provides a powerful approach for identifying the converging functions of autism-risk genes. (PsycInfo Database Record"

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas the more rigid uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into"

Here we show that hypobaric hypoxia induces cerebral edema in rats and that this is associated with increased expression of corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF), CRF receptor type 1 (CRFR1), aquaporin-4 (AQP4), and endothelin-1 (ET-1) in the cortex. We also show that, in cultured primary astrocytes, both CRFR1 and AQP4 are expressed, and that exogenous CRF, acting through CRFR1, triggers signaling of cAMP/PKA, intracellular Ca2+, and PKCε. The up-regulated cAMP/PKA signaling contributes to the phosphorylation and expression of AQP4 to enhance water influx into astrocytes and produces an up-regulation of ET-1 expression. Finally, using transfected CHO cells, we show that transfected CRFR1 contributes to edema via transfected AQP4. In conclusion, hypobaric hypoxia triggers cortical release of CRF, which acts on CRFR1 to trigger signaling of cAMP/PKA in cortical astrocytes, leading to activation of AQP4 and cerebral edema.

Specially, although STING−/− beneficially alleviated insulin resistance and glucose intolerance induced by high-fat diet, it surprisingly impaired islet glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Importantly, STING-βKO caused glucose intolerance due to impaired GSIS, indicating that STING is required for normal β-cell function.

Their genome is segmented into eight RNA fragments, which offers evolutionary advantages but complicates genomic packaging. The existence of a selective packaging mechanism, in which one copy of each viral RNA is specifically packaged into each virion, is suspected, but its molecular details remain unknown. Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus using in vitro experiments. We demonstrated that this interaction takes place in infected cells and is required for optimal viral replication. Disruption of this interaction did not affect the HA titer of the mutant viruses, suggesting that the same amount of viral particles was produced. However, it nonspecifically decreased the amount of viral RNA in the viral particles, resulting in an eightfold increase in empty viral particles. Our experiments indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions. The lack of conservation of these interactions might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses. (Show more)"

In this paper, we introduce a computer vision method to measure changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods from time-series street-level imagery. We connect changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods with economic and demographic data and find that three factors predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

The role of the recently identified cancer antigen, fibrous sheath interacting protein 1 (FSIP1), in TNBC has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. (Show more)"

However, these factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. Our findings have implications for the management of biodiversity and the design of climate change adaptation strategies. (Show more)"

Here, we show that striatonigral fibers originating in striosomes form highly unusual bouquet-like arborizations that target bundles of ventrally extending dopamine-containing dendrites and clusters of their parent nigral cell bodies. These clustered cell bodies in turn project to the striatum as part of the classic nigrostriatal pathway. Thus, these striosome–dendron bouquets likely represent subsystems with the nigro–striato–nigral loop that are affected in human disorders including Parkinson’s disease. Given evidence that striosomes receive input from cortical regions related to the control of mood and motivation and that they link functionally to reinforcement and decision-making, the striosome–dendron bouquets could be critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease. This study provides a unique view of the organization of the dopamine-containing nigral system. It also suggests that the striosome–dendron bouquets are specialized integrative units within the system. This organization may be important for the control of movement and motivation.

However, the evolution of specialization in predators has been considered an evolutionary dead end. Here we show that the evolution of specialization in siphonophores has led to the evolution of specialization in other predators. Our results contribute to understanding the evolution of specialization in predators, and the role of morphological innovation in the diversification of food webs."

However, the origin of the derived features of the modern human hand are poorly understood because of a lack of fossil evidence from the time of their origin. Here we report the discovery of the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key derived feature of the human hand, the third metacarpal styloid process. This fossil provides the earliest evidence for the evolution of the complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand. This finding suggests that the evolution of the human hand was more rapid than previously thought. It also suggests that the evolution of the Neandertal hand was more recent than previously thought. These findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution of the human hand and the hominin lineage."

One-carbon units are required for cell growth, and are supplied by the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). SHMT is a promising target for cancer therapy, but the enzyme is also critical for normal cell growth. Here we identify a small-molecule inhibitor of SHMT, and show that it blocks tumor growth in mice. We also show that the one-carbon donor formate can rescue cells from the inhibitor, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in a cancer cell-line screen. This is because formate is a substrate for SHMT, and thus the enzyme is required to meet demand for formate in cancer cells. Thus, formate is a targetable metabolic deficiency of cancer. These findings provide a metabolic rationale for the use of formate as a cancer therapeutic. They also provide a metabolic rationale for the use of SHMT inhibitors in cancer therapy. Finally, they provide a metabolic rationale for the use of formate as a one-carbon donor. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

In this study, we show that deforestation can have a negative impact on people’s diets. This finding has important implications for policy makers, who have largely overlooked forests in strategies to improve nutrition. Our results suggest that forests offer a potential “win–win"" solution to the triple crisis."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the discovery of a 100-m-long, 10-m-"
