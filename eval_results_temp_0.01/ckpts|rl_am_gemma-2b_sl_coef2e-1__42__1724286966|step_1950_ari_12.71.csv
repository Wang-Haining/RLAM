In this work, we report the structure of neon hydrate at high pressure and temperature. The structure is found to be a hydrate of neon, in which neon atoms are enclathrated in water molecules to form ice II-structured hydrates. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. Molecular dynamics simulation confirms that the resolved structure where Ne dissolved in ice II is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. The density distributions indicate that the vibration of Ne atoms is mainly in planes perpendicular to D2O channels, whereas their distributions along the channels are further constrained by interactions between adjacent Ne atoms. The results provide a new perspective on the structure of ice II and the nature of the hydrate. They also provide a new route to the synthesis of hydrates, which are of great importance in the petroleum industry. The results are expected to be of interest to a wide range of scientists.

The virus has a high capacity to evade the host immune response, including the interferon (IFN) response. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We found that SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. Our findings may help in the development of new antiviral strategies. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. Sperm cells are quiescent in the male reproductive system due to Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1 channels, but become active once introduced into the low-Zn2+-concentration environment of the female reproductive tract. How Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide"

We use global datasets of maize production and climate variability to quantify how maize yields will change in the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. We find that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields increases almost everywhere to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields. The probability that the top four maize-exporting countries have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes.

We show that this is not the case for large mammalian herbivores, and that the diversity of species within a community is reflected in the diversity of diets. This suggests that the diversity of herbivore species may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized."

The development of new antibiotics is a major challenge for the pharmaceutical industry. We present a rational design approach to identify new acylide antibiotics. The design strategy is based on computational predictions of membrane permeability, binding affinity to the ribosome, and solubility. We tested the best candidates in vitro and in vivo. The best candidate is synthetically more accessible, exhibits higher membrane permeability, and is up to 56 times more active against resistant pathogens than telithromycin. Notably, the best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. The design strategy can be used to develop new antibiotics for other classes of antibiotics. The approach can be extended to other classes of antibiotics and to other targets.

The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data. The proposed architecture is easy to implement, train, and apply in practice, and automatically adapts to different problems. It is also able to achieve state-of-the-art results in several problems.

This mechanism reduces the required undercooling of iron nucleation, which provides a key factor in solving the inner core nucleation paradox.

Today, most human plague cases are caused by rodent fleas, but this was not always the case. In this study, we show that human ectoparasite vectors, such as human fleas or body lice, were the primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic (14–19th centuries), including the Black Death (1347–1353). Our results challenge the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats. This study also provides a new perspective on the history of plague, which is a disease that has been studied for centuries. It is a reminder that the history of plague is still being written.

However, the function of TRAP1 in normal cells is not well understood. We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. Thus, TRAP1 may be a promising target for cancer therapy. However, the precise mechanism of action of TRAP1 in normal cells is not yet clear. Further studies are needed to determine the role of TRAP1 in normal cell physiology and to identify the precise"

They are dynamic, and their structure and function are regulated by a variety of proteins. One of the most important proteins of this family is cofilin, which is responsible for the disassembly of actin filaments. However, cofilin’s function is not understood in a physiological context, where filaments are interconnected and under mechanical stress. Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to study the action of cofilin in different mechanical situations. We find that mechanical stress enhances cofilin binding, but surprisingly, it has no effect on cofilin’s ability to sever filaments. We propose a simple model, which is supported by our experiments, that explains how mechanical stress enhances cofilin’s severing ability. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. Our findings have implications for understanding the role of cofilin in cancer and other diseases. They also have implications for understanding the role of mechanical stress in cells."

Rhinovirus is the most common cause of the common cold. Rhinovirus replicates more efficiently at the cool temperatures found in the nasal cavity than at the core body temperature of 37 °C. We show that mouse airway cells infected with rhinovirus exhibit a striking enrichment in expression of antiviral defense response genes at 37 °C relative to 33 °C. This correlates with higher expression levels of type I and type III IFN genes and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) at 37 °C. Rhinovirus replication is enhanced at 37 °C, and genetic deficiency of MAVS or the type I IFN receptor in infected airway cells partially rescues the temperature-dependent growth phenotype.

The structure of the peptide was solved by NMR spectroscopy, and it was found to be highly dynamic and largely disordered.

Because sperm are the only cells that are transferred from the male to the female, it is likely that sperm are exposed to a variety of female-derived molecules. However, the extent to which these molecules are involved in the life history of sperm is largely unknown. We show that the proteome of Drosophila sperm undergoes substantial changes after being transferred to the female reproductive tract. Multiple female-derived proteins associate with sperm immediately after mating, and they comprise nearly 20% of the postmating sperm proteome. Female-derived proteins that associate with sperm are enriched for processes associated with energy metabolism, suggesting that female contributions support sperm viability during the prolonged period between copulation and fertilization. Our research provides a comprehensive characterization of sperm proteome dynamics and expands our understanding of the critical process of sperm–FRT interactions. (Show more)"

In this paper, we introduce a new instrument, the dual-field-of-view high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL), which can provide high-resolution and simultaneous observations of aerosols and clouds. The HSRL observations over Beijing show that the aerosol loading increased the water cloud droplet number concentration and decreased the droplet effective radius. However, the aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI process. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI.

We found that stimulation-induced eating is dependent on dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. We also found that stimulation-induced eating is dependent on neurons in the LH that project to the ventral tegmental area and that these neurons are themselves dependent on neurons in the locus coeruleus.

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, we found that women’s and men’s endorsement of hegemonic masculinity predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. The findings highlight the importance of psychological examinations of masculinity as a cultural ideology to understand how men’s and women’s endorsement of hegemonic masculinity legitimizes patriarchal dominance and reinforces gender, race, and class hierarchies via candidate support. The findings also have implications for the study of gender, race, and class in the United States. (PsycInfo Database Record"

We used a combination of expert opinion and scientific evidence to identify risk factors for spillover and spread of viruses in humans. We then developed a risk ranking framework and interactive web tool, SpillOver, that estimates a risk score for wildlife-origin viruses, creating a comparative risk assessment of viruses with uncharacterized zoonotic spillover potential alongside those already known to be zoonotic. We validated the risk assessment using data from virus discovery projects and public records of virus detections around the world. The top 12 ranked viruses were known zoonotic viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Several newly detected viruses ranked higher than known zoonotic viruses. SpillOver is a living, interactive database that can be refined over time to continue to improve the quality and public availability of information on viral threats to human health.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how HKU4 and HKU5 transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions. Our findings are important for understanding the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV in humans and for developing effective countermeasures against future bat coronavirus threats to human health."

In eukaryotes, the lagging strand of DNA is replicated in short fragments called Okazaki fragments. The synthesis of these fragments is highly processive and requires the sliding clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) to maintain the polymerase holoenzyme in a stable association with the DNA. However, the stability of this complex is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. Here, we show that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. Our results also suggest that the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme may be a key factor in the regulation of lagging strand replication. These findings have implications for understanding the role of pol δ in human disease. (PsycINFO Database Record"

Here, we report a simple and objective method to identify the animal origin of parchment. The noninvasive method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period.

The age of the extinction is a key parameter in understanding its cause and the controls on extinction/recovery dynamics. We present a new age model for the extinction based on U-Pb dating of volcanic ash beds. The age of the extinction is 251.941 ± 0.037 and 251.880 ± 0.031 Mya, an interval of 60 ± 48 ka. The carbon cycle reorganization that preceded the extinction is punctuated by a sharp (3‰), short-lived negative spike in the isotopic composition of carbonate carbon. The carbon cycle volatility persists for ∼500 ka before a return to near preextinction values. Decamillenial to millennial level resolution of the mass extinction and its aftermath will permit a refined evaluation of the relative roles of rate-dependent processes contributing to the extinction, allowing insight into postextinction ecosystem expansion. The age model will also be used to evaluate the plausibility of trigger and kill mechanisms. (Show more)"

However, the role of RORα in the intestinal epithelium is not well understood. Here, we generated intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific RORα-deficient (RORαΔIEC) mice and found that RORα is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis by attenuating nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcriptional activity. RORαΔIEC mice exhibit excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs.

Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium.

It is powered by the capture of solar radiation and its conversion to chemical energy. The conversion of the absorbed energy into chemical energy is accomplished by the chlorophyll pigments, which are modified tetrapyrroles. The biosynthesis of these pigments is among the most productive biological pathways on Earth. The formation of the fifth isocyclic ring, the so-called bacteriochlorophyll ring, has remained enigmatic for more than 60 y. This reaction is catalyzed by two unrelated enzymes using different chemistries. The majority of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria use a [4Fe-4S] cluster protein, BchE, whereas plants, cyanobacteria, and some phototrophic bacteria possess a diiron protein, AcsF. Plant and cyanobacterial mutants in ycf54 display impaired function of the diiron enzyme, accumulating the reaction substrate. These results indicate that Ycf54 is a cyclase subunit in oxygenic phototrophs, and that different classes of the enzyme exist based on their requirement for an additional subunit. These data delineate three classes of diiron cyclase in chlorophototrophic organisms from higher plants to bacteria, and their evolution is discussed"

Therefore, it is difficult to identify the causal genes and the causal pathways. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility in autism and suggest that the activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting is a common mechanism for autism-risk genes. These findings may also be applicable to other complex disorders. (PsycINFO Database Record"

MTX selectively inhibits the epoxide hydrolase function of leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) to inhibit LTA4 hydrolysis and the generation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a potent lipid chemoattractant for host defense against infection. MTX potently inhibited proinflammatory proteases to induce immune tolerance and maintain high stability.

The presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in the brain and spinal cord suggests that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners of these three proteins. This result suggests that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas the more rigid uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into"

These findings suggest that this form of regeneration may be a powerful platform for the discovery of new genes involved in regeneration. Moreover, they suggest that the nervous system may be more plastic than previously thought, and that the adult nervous system may be more regenerative than previously thought.

It is essential for the maintenance of genetic diversity in populations and for the repair of DNA damage. In humans, recombination is the primary mechanism for the generation of genetic variation. In this paper, we describe the distribution of recombination across the genome of a flowering plant, Mimulus guttatus. We find that recombination is concentrated in hotspots, interspersed with cold regions. The distribution of hotspots is similar to that observed in yeast and in mice lacking a positive-regulatory domain zinc finger protein 9. These results suggest that recombination patterns in flowering plants may be similar to those in other eukaryotes. They also provide a model for the study of recombination in a natural population.

The identification of these networks is a key step in understanding the functional organization of the brain. Here, we used a combination of functional MRI and metabolic imaging to identify and validate reproducible resting state networks in healthy and disease populations. We show that the dominant resting state network in healthy subjects is topologically similar to the default mode network. In contrast, in Parkinson’s disease, this dominant network is subordinated to an independent disease-related pattern. Network functionality was assessed by quantifying metabolic RSN expression in cerebral blood flow PET scans acquired at rest and during task performance. We show that the dominant resting state network is deactivated during rest and activated during task performance. Network deactivation was reduced in advanced Parkinson’s disease, and time-course comparisons of DMN loss in longitudinal resting metabolic scans from Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease subjects illustrated that significant reductions appeared later for Parkinson’s disease, in parallel with the development of cognitive dysfunction. In contrast, in Alzheimer’s disease significant reductions in network expression were already present at diagnosis, progressing over time. Metabolic imaging can directly provide useful information regarding the resting organization of the brain in health and disease"

In bacteria, the most studied modification is the 5′ nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) modification. In this study, we show that NAD-RNA is found on subsets of nuclear and mitochondrial encoded mRNAs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. NAD-RNA appears to be produced cotranscriptionally because NAD-RNA is also found on pre-mRNAs, and only on mitochondrial transcripts that are not 5′ end processed. These results define an additional 5′ RNA cap structure in eukaryotes and raise the possibility that this 5′ NAD+ cap could modulate RNA stability and translation on specific subclasses of mRNAs.

However, the role of FSIP1 in the progression and drug sensitivity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. This article is protected by copyright.

However, these factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. First, more diverse communities had a greater chance of including species with thermal traits that enabled them to maintain productivity as temperatures shifted from ambient conditions. Second, we found a pronounced increase in the contribution of complementarity to the net biodiversity effect at high and low temperatures, indicating that changes in species interactions played a critical role in mediating the impacts of temperature change on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. This study highlights the importance of considering the combined effects of biodiversity loss and environmental warming on ecosystem functioning. (Show more)"

Here, we used portable two-photon microscopes to record the activity of large populations of neurons in MEC and adjacent parasubiculum during unrestrained behavior. We found that grid cells are anatomically distinct from border, HD, and OV cells. These data suggest that grid cell networks might be largely distinct from those of border, HD, and OV cells.

We show that striatonigral fibers originating in striosomes form highly unusual bouquet-like arborizations that target bundles of ventrally extending dopamine-containing dendrites and clusters of their parent nigral cell bodies. These clustered cell bodies in turn project to the striatum as part of the classic nigrostriatal pathway. Thus, these striosome–dendron bouquets likely represent subsystems with the nigro–striato–nigral loop that are affected in human disorders including Parkinson’s disease. Given evidence that striosomes receive input from cortical regions related to the control of mood and motivation and that they link functionally to reinforcement and decision-making, the striosome–dendron bouquets could be critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease. The striosome–dendron bouquets are likely to be a target for future studies of the dopamine system in health and disease. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Certification had no impact on deforestation in peatlands, which are a major source of carbon emissions and fires. Certification had no impact on deforestation in areas with active fires, which are a major source of carbon emissions. Certification had no impact on deforestation in areas with little residual forest, which are a major source of carbon emissions. Certification had no impact on deforestation in areas with high-carbon soils, which are a major source of carbon emissions. Certification had no impact on deforestation in areas with high-carbon stocks, which are a major source of carbon emissions. Certification had no impact on deforestation in areas with high-carbon stocks and high-carbon stocks. Certification had no impact on deforestation in areas with high-carbon stocks and high-carbon stocks. Certification had no impact on deforestation in areas with high-carbon stocks and high-carbon stocks. Certification had no impact on deforestation in areas with high-carbon stocks and high-carbon"

Dysfunction of the exocyst complex is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. However, the study of the regulation of the exocyst complex is limited by the lethality or the severity of phenotypes in the only genetically tractable organism, Arabidopsis thaliana. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

In many vertebrates, sex determination is controlled by a single locus, resulting in two sexes. In contrast, many vertebrates have multiple sex determination alleles segregating within a single species, resulting in more than two genotypic sexes. Here we show that the evolution of multiple sex determination alleles can result in modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics, and that the maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles can result in the evolution of higher-order sexual polymorphism. These results have implications for understanding the evolution of sex determination alleles, and the maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations. (Show more)"

The retina is also challenged by the accumulation of lipid-derived reactive intermediates, which can photodegrade and damage the retina. We show that the intracellular levels of iron, which are known to regulate the redox state of the retina, can influence the photochemical oxidation and degradation of a lipid-derived reactive intermediate, A2E. These findings have implications for the understanding of the role of iron in the retina and for the development of strategies to protect the retina from oxidative damage. (Read more)"

However, the evolution of predator specialization is often considered a dead end, due to the constraints associated with the evolution of morphological and functional optimizations throughout the organism. Here we show that the evolution of siphonophore predators has been characterized by a high degree of specialization, and that these changes are localized in separate structures dedicated to prey capture. Our results help to understand the evolution of predator specialization, and the morphological changes associated with prey-type shifts. These findings contribute to understanding how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs."

This fossil provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key derived characteristic of the modern human hand."

One of the key metabolic changes in cancer is the up-regulation of the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). SHMT converts serine into glycine and a tetrahydrofolate-bound one-carbon unit. This one-carbon unit is used to synthesize purine and thymidine, which are essential for cell growth. We have developed a series of small molecules that inhibit both SHMT1 and SHMT2. We show that these compounds are effective in cancer cell lines, and that one of the cell lines is uniquely dependent on SHMT enzymatic activity for glycine import. Thus, we have identified a metabolic vulnerability of one type of cancer that can be targeted therapeutically. This work provides a metabolic basis for the use of SHMT inhibitors in cancer therapy.

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We hypothesize that the large size of sauropods, the largest animals that walked Earth, may have been a key factor in the evolution of fixed foraging trails, which are a common feature of modern agriculture. This suggests that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. Our results have implications for the evolution of modern agriculture and the role of large animals in the history of life on Earth. (Show more)"
