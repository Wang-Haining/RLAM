In this work, we report the synthesis and structure of a hydrate, neon hydrate, which is an ice II-like hydrate with neon atoms dissolved in the channels of water molecules. The guest atoms are free to move in the channels, and the guest–host interactions are weak. Our results provide a new route to the synthesis of ice II-like hydrates.

Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. To gain insight into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite, we compared the transcriptomes of two distantly related myxozoan species to the transcriptome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insights into the origin of parasitic lifestyles and the evolution of the parasite genome. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. Sperm cells are quiescent in the male reproductive system due to Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels, but become active once introduced into the low-Zn2+-concentration environment of the female reproductive tract. How Zn2+ inhibits proton channels is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some proton channel residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels"

Grass consumption inferred from mean sequence relative read abundance ranged from &gt;99% (plains zebra) to &lt;1% (dik-dik). Grass RRA was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of % grass consumption, indicating that RRA conveys reliable quantitative information about consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of size-matched grazers—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammal assemblages, and that large mammal diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized."

We show that inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis induction, and that this combination therapy results in near-complete tumor regression in preclinical models. These findings suggest that targeting the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and ferroptosis may be a promising strategy for cancer therapy. (Show more)"

The most common treatment for hypertension is the use of drugs that block the voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channel (Cav1.2). However, these drugs are associated with the development of heart failure. Here, we show that the three major classes of LCCBs activate the store-operated Ca2+ channel (SOCC) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which is mediated by the N terminus of the channel. This activation promotes vascular remodeling. Our findings indicate that the use of LCCBs should be carefully considered in patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling. This is because the levels of the Ca2+ sensor protein STIM and the Ca2+ channel ORAI are elevated in these patients. (Show more)"

To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice, and automatically adapts to different problems. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data."

The furin cleavage site within the spike protein was deleted from the viral genome for added safety of the vaccine strain. The vaccine candidate is temperature sensitive in vitro and grows robustly at the permissive temperature. In addition, the vaccine candidate is highly attenuated and generates high levels of spike-specific antibodies in hamsters. The vaccine candidate is protective at a single intranasal dose in a relevant hamster model.

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal and transformed cells is more complex than previously appreciated. We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This study also provides a rationale for the development of TRAP1-directed therapies in cancer. (Read more)"

The virus replicates more efficiently at the cool temperatures of the nasal cavity than at core body temperature. To understand the mechanism of temperature-dependent growth, we compared the transcriptional response of mouse airway cells infected with rhinovirus at 33 °C vs. 37 °C. We found that mouse airway cells infected with mouse-adapted rhinovirus exhibit a striking enrichment in expression of antiviral defense response genes at 37 °C relative to 33 °C, which correlated with significantly higher expression levels of type I and type III IFN genes and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) at 37 °C. Temperature-dependent IFN induction in response to rhinovirus was dependent on the MAVS protein, a key signaling adaptor of the RIG-I–like receptors (RLRs).

The pili-mediated surface sensing system is mechanochemical, as it requires the mechanical activity of the pili to induce conformational changes in the chemosensory protein PilJ, which in turn activates the pili.

In this study, we use proteomics to characterize the posttesticular life history of the Drosophila sperm proteome and determine the extent of molecular continuity between males and females. We show that the sperm proteome undergoes substantial compositional changes after being transferred to the female reproductive tract. Multiple seminal fluid proteins initially associate with sperm, but most become undetectable after sperm are stored. Female-derived proteins also begin to associate with sperm immediately after mating, and they comprise nearly 20% of the postmating sperm proteome following 4 d of storage in the female reproductive tract. Female-derived proteins that associate with sperm are enriched for processes associated with energy metabolism, suggesting that female contributions support sperm viability during the prolonged period between copulation and fertilization. Our research provides a comprehensive characterization of sperm proteome dynamics and expands our understanding of the critical process of sperm–FRT interactions. (Show more)"

However, the ACI is difficult to be well represented in current climate models. This is due to the complexity of the ACI and the lack of observational capability. To overcome this conundrum, we introduce the dual-field-of-view (FOV) high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) for simultaneously profiling aerosol and water cloud properties, especially water cloud microphysical properties. This instrument, verified by the Monte Carlo simulation and coincident observations of other techniques, was used to investigate the interactions between aerosol loading and water cloud microphysical properties. A case study over Beijing highlights the scientific potential of dual-FOV HSRL to become a significant contributor to the ACI investigations. The observed water cloud profiles identify that due to air entrainment its vertical structure is not perfectly adiabatic, as assumed by many current retrieval methods. These observations constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI.

This study provides a new perspective on the temperature history of the early Earth by using the thermostability of reconstructed ancestral enzymes to infer ancient surface temperatures. The results suggest that Earth’s surface cooled from ∼65–80 °C in the Archean to ∼15 °C today. This finding is consistent with previous isotope-based and protein reconstruction-based interpretations.

They open and close their pore gates to regulate ion flow. K+ channels commonly possess two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that BK channel C-type inactivation is state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. Our findings provide insights into the regulation of K+ channel gating and inactivation. They also suggest that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. These findings may help to understand the pathophysiology of K+ channel dysfunction in cardiac arrhythmia and other diseases.

In the temperate regions, seasonal outbreaks of influenza correlate closely with decreases in ambient humidity. While low ambient humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms of dry air-induced disease pathology and may lead to the development of strategies to mitigate the impact of influenza virus infection in the temperate regions.

This pattern of activity is consistent with a bottom-up parser that applies a merge operation to the incoming language stream.

By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself.

We developed a framework to identify risk factors for spillover and spread of viruses from animals to humans. We then used this framework to systematically identify the highest-risk viruses, which were then ranked by spillover potential. We validated the framework using data from a virus discovery project and public records of virus detections around the world. The resulting database, SpillOver, is a living, interactive database that can be used by policy makers and health scientists to inform research and public health interventions for prevention and rapid control of disease outbreaks. SpillOver is a tool that can be refined over time to continue to improve the quality and public availability of information on viral threats to human health.

The color of nectar is an important trait that attracts animals, but the mechanisms that underlie the production of colorful nectar are poorly understood. We show that the red color of the nectar of Nesocodon mauritianus is derived from a previously undescribed alkaloid, nesocodin. We also identify nesocodin in the red nectar of the distantly related and hummingbird-visited Jaltomata herrerae and provide molecular evidence for convergent evolution of this trait. This work cumulatively identifies a convergently evolved trait in two vertebrate-pollinated species, suggesting that the red pigment is selectively favored and that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation. This work also provides a molecular framework for the study of the evolution of colorful nectar."

In addition, we show that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how HKU4 and HKU5 transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. First, whereas MERS-CoV prefers human DPP4 over bat DPP4 as its receptor, HKU4 shows the opposite trend. Second, in the absence of exogenous proteases, both MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes mediate pseudovirus entry into bat cells, whereas only MERS-CoV, but not HKU4, mediates pseudovirus entry into human cells.

Surprisingly, the results indicate that human pol δ maintains a loose association with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion.

In the hypothesized RNA world, before the evolution of proteins, genetic information was stored in RNA molecules that were replicated by ribozymes. In an effort toward reconstructing RNA-based life in the laboratory, in vitro evolution was used to improve dramatically the activity and generality of an RNA polymerase ribozyme by selecting variants that can synthesize functional RNA molecules from an RNA template. The improved polymerase ribozyme is able to synthesize a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and, in low yield, even tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins."

We also show that xan BGC-derived isocyanides are secreted and bind copper as visualized by a chrome azurol S (CAS) assay, and that inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis of intracellular copper pools demonstrated a role for xan cluster metabolites in the accumulation of copper. The existence of the xan BGC in several filamentous fungi suggests a heretofore unknown role of eukaryotic natural products in copper homeostasis and mediation of interactions with competing microbes. This study also provides a mechanism for the antimicrobial properties of xanthocillin and other isocyanide-derived metabolites.

There is an urgent need for novel and more efficient therapies for AML, ideally targeting the disease at its stem cell origin. We show here that monoclonal antibodies targeting the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action.

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

Neuroinflammation is also known to be associated with autoimmune diseases, such as EAE. Neuroinflammation is regulated by a variety of signaling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT. However, the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (ASK1) in neuroinflammation is unknown. In this study, we found that ASK1 is involved in the regulation of neuroinflammation in EAE. ASK1 deficiency in microglia/macrophages, but not in astrocytes, ameliorated the early and later stages of EAE. ASK1 signaling in microglia/macrophages was required for the generation and maintenance of EAE. ASK1-deficient microglia/macrophages produced proinflammatory cytokines, which activated astrocytes to exacerbate neuroinflammation.

The drought began in 2012 and now includes the lowest calendar-year and 12-mo precipitation, the highest annual temperature, and the most extreme drought indicators on record. The extremely warm and dry conditions have led to acute water shortages, groundwater overdraft, critically low streamflow, and enhanced wildfire risk. We find that precipitation deficits that occur when conditions are warm are more than twice as likely to yield drought years. We also find that although there has not been a substantial change in the probability of either negative or moderately negative precipitation anomalies in recent decades, the occurrence of drought years has been greater in the past two decades than in the preceding century. Finally, we conclude that anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of co-occurring warm–dry conditions like those that have created the acute human and ecosystem impacts associated with the “exceptional” 2012–2014 drought in California."

The etiology of autism is so complicated because it involves the effects of variants of several hundred risk genes along with the contribution of environmental factors. Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. As an alternative approach, extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying the convergence of the targets and functions of the autism-risk genes to facilitate mapping out causal paths. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. Mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic"

This paper provides a comprehensive design-based analysis of the effects of vote-by-mail on electoral outcomes. We find that vote-by-mail does not appear to affect either party’s share of turnout, does not appear to increase either party’s vote share, and modestly increases overall average turnout rates. All three conclusions support the conventional wisdom of election administration experts and contradict many popular claims in the media. Our results suggest that vote-by-mail is a policy that can be implemented with minimal electoral consequences. This is an important finding for election administration experts and policymakers. It also has implications for the broader literature on the effects of mail voting. Our results suggest that the effects of vote-by-mail are likely to be similar to those of mail voting. This is an important finding for scholars interested in the effects of mail voting. Our results also suggest that the effects of vote-by-mail are likely to be similar to those of in-person voting.

Although the molecular mechanisms of T2D are well known, the treatment of T2D is still a challenge. In this study, we found that STING is required for normal β-cell function. STING deficiency decreased expression of β-cell function–related genes, including Glut2, Kcnj11, and Abcc8, contributing to impaired GSIS. Mechanistically, the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) and cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&amp;Tag) analyses suggested that Pax6 was the transcription factor that might be associated with defective GSIS in STING-βKO mice. Indeed, Pax6 messenger RNA and protein levels were down-regulated and its nuclear localization was lost in STING-βKO β-cells.

Their genome is segmented into eight fragments, which offers evolutionary advantages but complicates genomic packaging. The existence of a selective packaging mechanism, in which one copy of each viral RNA is specifically packaged into each virion, is suspected, but its molecular details remain unknown. Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus using in vitro experiments. Using silent trans-complementary mutants, we then demonstrated that this interaction takes place in infected cells and is required for optimal viral replication. Disruption of this interaction did not affect the HA titer of the mutant viruses, suggesting that the same amount of viral particles was produced. However, it nonspecifically decreased the amount of viral RNA in the viral particles, resulting in an eightfold increase in empty viral particles. Competition experiments indicated that this interaction favored copackaging of the interacting viral RNA segments. The interaction we identified involves regions not previously designated as packaging signals and is not widely conserved among influenza A virus. Combined with previous studies, our experiments indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a"

The objective of this study is to investigate the functional role of YAP/TAZ in the flow regulation of atheroprone endothelial phenotypes and the consequential development of atherosclerotic lesions. We found that exposure of cultured endothelial cells (ECs) to the atheroprone disturbed flow resulted in YAP/TAZ activation and translocation into EC nucleus to up-regulate the target genes, including cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (CYR61), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and ankyrin repeat domain 1 (ANKRD1).

Humans have vastly expanded the spatial and seasonal “fire niche” in the coterminous United States, accounting for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. During the 21-y time period, the human-caused fire season was three times longer than the lightning-caused fire season and added an average of 40,000 wildfires per year across the United States. Human-started wildfires disproportionally occurred where fuel moisture was higher than lightning-started fires, thereby helping expand the geographic and seasonal niche of wildfire.

The resulting shift from uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host.

This variation is likely to have a major impact on the evolution of plants."

However, the brain is also a metabolic system, with fluctuations in total activity that are not reflected in functional connectivity. We used metabolic imaging to identify and validate the resting organization of the brain, and to assess its functional role. We found that the dominant resting metabolic network in healthy subjects was topologically similar to the default mode network. In Parkinson’s disease, this dominant network was subordinated to a disease-related pattern. Network functionality was assessed by quantifying metabolic RSN expression in cerebral blood flow PET scans acquired at rest and during task performance. Network deactivation was reduced in early Parkinson’s disease, and partially corrected by dopaminergic therapy. Time-course comparisons of DMN loss in longitudinal resting metabolic scans from Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease subjects illustrated that significant reductions appeared later for PD, in parallel with the development of cognitive dysfunction. In contrast, in Alzheimer’s disease significant reductions in network expression were already present at diagnosis, progressing over time. Metabolic imaging can directly provide useful information regarding the resting organization of the brain in health and disease."

We show that NAD-RNA is found on subsets of nuclear and mitochondrial encoded mRNAs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. NAD-RNA appears to be produced cotranscriptionally because NAD-RNA is also found on pre-mRNAs, and only on mitochondrial transcripts that are not 5′ end processed. This discovery of a second 5′ modification in eukaryotes raises the possibility that this 5′ NAD+ cap could modulate RNA stability and translation on specific subclasses of mRNAs.

Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. (Show more)"

The etiology of this disease is complex and involves multiple factors, including the composition of the gut microbiota. The aim of the present study was to explore whether changes in gut permeability are linked to gut-microbiota composition and activity in alcohol-dependent subjects. We also investigated whether gut dysfunction is associated with the psychological symptoms of alcohol dependence. Finally, we tested the reversibility of the biological and behavioral parameters after a short-term detoxification program. We found that some, but not all, alcohol-dependent subjects developed gut leakiness, which was associated with higher scores of depression, anxiety, and alcohol craving after 3 wk of abstinence, which may be important psychological factors of relapse.

However, these factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects of biodiversity loss and environmental warming on ecosystem functioning. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. Our findings have important implications for the design of conservation strategies and the management of ecosystems under global warming."

We asked pairs of friends and strangers to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Finally, we demonstrate that this signal is used by third-party listeners as a heuristic of how well people are connected: Conversations with faster response times were perceived as more connected than the same conversations with slower response times. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

In many species, the sex of an individual is determined by a single locus, but in others, multiple loci interact to produce multiple genotypic sexes. Here we show that the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii has four possible genotypes for sex determination, which produce four possible phenotypes. We show that the modularity of these four phenotypes results from the interplay of sex linkage and sex limitation. The modularity of secondary sexual characteristics produced by polygenic sex determination provides context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of the maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations."

Vitamin A is a potent prooxidant that is photodegraded into reactive intermediates that can damage the retina. Iron is also a prooxidant that is present in the retina and is a cofactor for the photodegradation of vitamin A. We show that iron levels in the retina impact the levels of a class of molecules that are important for the health of the retina. This work has implications for the retina and for the rest of the body, given that iron is a cofactor for many reactions that are important for health. (Read more)"

They are considered a model system for studying the evolution of specialization, but the mechanisms behind this process are still unclear. Here we show that siphonophore specialization is not a dead end, but rather a process that can be reversed. We also show that the evolution of siphonophore tentacles is strongly linked to prey type, and that this association is associated with the evolution of the nematocysts. Our findings contribute to understanding the mechanisms behind the evolution of specialization, and how it has shaped present-day food webs."

The fossil record for the hominin hand between 800,000 and 1.8 My old is limited, and the oldest known hominin hand fossils are incomplete. This study provides the earliest known evidence for the evolution of a key derived feature of the human hand, the third metacarpal styloid process. The discovery of this feature in a fossil from East Africa suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato.

In this study, we show that deforestation can have a negative impact on people’s diets, particularly in rural areas of low- and middle-income countries. This study has important implications for policy makers, as forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. This study also highlights the need for a more holistic approach to food and nutrition security, which considers the role of natural landscapes such as forests in meeting nutrition goals.

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the discovery of a"
