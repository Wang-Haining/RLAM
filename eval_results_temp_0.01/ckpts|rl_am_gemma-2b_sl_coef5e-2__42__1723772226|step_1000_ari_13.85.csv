In this work, we report the synthesis of neon hydrate, which is the first example of a hydrate with the ice II structure. The guest atoms are enclathrated in the water molecules, and the guest–host interactions are weak. The guest atoms are free to move in the channels, which is a unique feature of this hydrate. The structure of neon hydrate is stable at high pressure and temperature, and the guest atoms are expected to be mobile in the channels. This work provides a new perspective on the structure of ice II and the guest–host interactions in hydrates. It also provides a new route to study the structure of ice II and the guest–host interactions in hydrates."

The axioms are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. This addresses a question about the mathematical foundations of quantum theory raised in reconstruction programs such as those of von Neumann, Mackey, Jauch, Piron, Abramsky, and Coecke."

To understand the origin of the parasitic lifestyle, we compared the genomes of two myxozoans to the genome of a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results show that the myxozoan genome is one of the smallest reported in animals, and that the parasites are a sister taxon to the less reduced cnidarian parasite. The parasites are also characterized by a reduction in gene content and expression of signaling pathways and transcriptional factors important for development. These results suggest that the parasitic lifestyle was accompanied by a reduction in genome size and gene content. This is the first time that a taxonomic sampling that represents the breadth of myxozoan diversity has been used to infer the evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the antiviral action of IFN and may help to design new strategies to combat the ongoing pandemic.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels."

Here, we quantify the impact of climate change on maize yields in the major maize-producing and -exporting countries. We find that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields increases almost everywhere to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields. For the top four maize-exporting countries, which account for 87% of global maize exports, the probability that they have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. They also underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance."

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is largely unknown because of the difficulty of species-level identification of plant remains in traditional studies. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species (six wild, one domestic) in semiarid African savanna. Our results show that, despite being similar in body size and digestive physiology, these species differed in their proportional grass consumption, and that dietary overlap was greatest between species that were dissimilar in these ways. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.

Using data from the Malaspina 2010 circumnavigation, regional surveys, and previously published reports, we show that the global load of plastic on the open ocean surface is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This discrepancy is explained by the size distribution of floating plastic debris, which points at important size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered.

Here we show that anxiety, a personality trait, directly influences social dominance in rats and identify an important mediating role for mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens. High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low-anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as decreased ATP and increased ROS production in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious individuals.

In addition, we discovered that SREBP1-mediated induction of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) plays a critical role in the ferroptosis-suppressing activity of SREBP1. These findings suggest that the combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction may be a promising strategy for the treatment of cancer. (Show more)"

These findings suggest that TRAP1 may act as a tumor suppressor in some settings."

They are dynamic polymers that can be assembled and disassembled. The disassembly process is regulated by a family of proteins that are named actin depolymerizing factors (ADF)/cofilins. These proteins are involved in many cellular processes, such as cell migration and cytokinesis. The mechanism by which ADF/cofilins disassemble actin filaments is not fully understood. Here, we show that ADF/cofilins can induce a mechanical torque on the filaments, which enhances the disassembly process. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical for cells to disassemble highly connected filament networks, such as those found in the cortex. Our results provide a mechanism for how cells can efficiently disassemble filament networks, which are essential for cell migration and cytokinesis."

We used a grid-based approach to sample the genomic diversity across the island, and we found that the Malagasy population is a mixture of Bantu and Austronesian ancestries, with a limited contribution from Europe and the Middle East. The distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, we found that a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. This study provides a new perspective on the settlement history of Madagascar, and it has implications for the settlement of the Indian Ocean islands. (Show more)"

We show that the presence of Ψ in mRNA can have a modest effect on translation, and that this effect can be observed in a reconstituted translation system as well as human cells. Our work suggests that the presence of Ψ in mRNA can modestly alter both translation speed and mRNA decoding. This is an important finding because it suggests that the presence of Ψ in mRNA can have a significant impact on the translation of the protein encoded by that mRNA.

This mechanosensory system is based on the type IV pili, a major surface adhesin, and is mediated by the Chp chemosensory system. The system is activated by the mechanical activity of pili, which leads to the stimulation of the Chp system and the activation of a positive feedback loop that promotes long-term surface attachment and stimulates additional virulence and biofilm-inducing pathways. This mechanochemical model for surface sensing provides a new perspective on the evolution of bacterial sensory systems. It also demonstrates that type IV pili are not only involved in twitching motility, but also as a sensor regulating surface-induced gene expression and pathogenicity. This study thus contributes to our understanding of the evolution of bacterial sensory systems and their role in the regulation of virulence. (Show more)"

Our research provides a comprehensive characterization of the posttesticular life history of the sperm proteome and expands our understanding of the critical process of sperm–FRT interactions.

However, the ACI process is complex and difficult to be well represented in current climate models. This is due to the lack of observational capability. To overcome this conundrum, we introduce the dual-field-of-view (FOV) high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) for simultaneously profiling aerosol and water cloud properties, especially water cloud microphysical properties. This instrument, verified by the Monte Carlo simulation and coincident observations of other techniques, was used to investigate the interactions between aerosol loading and water cloud microphysical properties. A case study over Beijing highlights the scientific potential of dual-FOV HSRL to become a significant contributor to the ACI investigations. The observations obtained from the dual-FOV HSRL constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI process. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI."

The temperature of the surface of the Earth in the past can be inferred from the isotopic composition of marine cherts, but this interpretation has been subject to question due to uncertainties regarding oceanic isotopic compositions, diagenetic or metamorphic resetting of the isotopic record, and depositional environments. We present thermostability measurements of ancestral enzymes derived from light-requiring prokaryotic and eukaryotic phototrophs having widely separated fossil-based divergence ages. The ancestral environmental temperatures thereby determined for these photic-zone organisms––shown in modern taxa to correlate strongly with NDK thermostability––are inferred to reflect ancient surface-environment paleotemperatures. Our results suggest that Earth’s surface temperature decreased over geological time from ∼65–80 °C in the Archean, a finding consistent both with previous isotope-based and protein reconstruction-based interpretations.

The pore gate of an ion channel is the main site of ion flow and is responsible for channel activation and deactivation. The selectivity filter is the site of slow inactivation and recovery. We found that the K+ channel BK has two distinct gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. The two gates are spatially overlapped or coexisting at the selectivity filter. C-type inactivation in BK channels is state-dependent and is closed state-dependent. The rates of C-type inactivation and recovery are inversely correlated with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. These findings provide a new perspective on the regulation of ion channels. (Show more)"

This pattern of activity is consistent with a neural implementation of a bottom-up or left-corner parser of the incoming language stream.

We find that the spider’s web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to sense the motion of web threads, which is better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself.

Here we present a genome-wide analysis of a group of 11 individuals from Bavaria, Germany, who died mostly between 450 and 650 AD. Our results indicate that the genetic ancestry of men is mostly consistent with modern northern and central Europeans, but that women exhibit a very high genetic heterogeneity, including signals of genetic ancestry ranging from western Europe to East Asia. In addition, we found that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago. These results suggest that complex demographic processes during the Early Medieval period may have contributed in an unexpected way to shape the modern European genetic landscape. The analysis of functional variants also indicates that the genetic history of Europe is not only shaped by migrations, but also by natural selection. Our results have implications for our understanding of the genetic history of Europe and the evolution of human traits."

The results suggest that the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of bat coronaviruses are dependent on the host species. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmission. These findings provide insights into the origin of MERS-CoV and the evolution of bat coronaviruses. They also provide a basis for the development of a vaccine and antiviral drugs against MERS-CoV.

The lagging strand of the DNA double helix is synthesized in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells and is responsible for the synthesis of the Okazaki fragments of the lagging strand of the linear genome. The process of lagging strand synthesis is highly complex and requires the cooperation of multiple proteins. In this study, we have developed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the human DNA polymerase δ (pol δ) holoenzyme. Our results indicate that pol δ maintains a loose association with the PCNA sliding clamp while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This study provides a unique perspective on the dynamics of the pol δ holoenzyme and its implications for the process of lagging strand synthesis. (Show more)"

This polymerase can also synthesize a variety of functional RNA molecules, including aptamers and ribozymes. Furthermore, the polymerase can amplify RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins.

We connect changes in the physical appearance of five US cities with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities."

We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning.

Results show that people around the world do, in fact, react more strongly to negative news content, and that this negativity bias is present in both Anglo-American and non-Anglo-American samples. The results also show that individual-level variation in responsiveness to news content is substantial, and that this variation is not explained by demographic or political characteristics.

These inclusions contain a variety of proteins that do not share obvious characteristics other than coaggregation. However, recent evidence from other neurodegenerative disorders suggests that disease-affected biochemical pathways can be characterized by the presence of proteins that are supersaturated, with cellular concentrations significantly greater than their solubilities. Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions of mutant SOD1, TDP-43, and FUS are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. To explain the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in the brain and spinal cord, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into endosomes."

Here we show that hypobaric hypoxia induces cerebral edema in rats and that this is mediated by the release of corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) from the hypothalamus, which acts on the cerebral cortex via its receptor CRFR1 to trigger signaling of cAMP/PKA in astrocytes, leading to activation of AQP4 and cerebral edema. These findings provide a molecular basis for the development of cerebral edema in hypoxia and may lead to the development of new therapies for this potentially life-threatening condition.

The present study shows that gut permeability is increased in alcohol-dependent subjects, which is associated with psychological symptoms of the disease. Moreover, the composition and activity of the gut microbiota are altered in these subjects. These results suggest that the gut microbiota is involved in the development of the disease and in the regulation of the psychological symptoms of alcohol dependence. Thus, the gut microbiota seems to be a previously unidentified target in the management of alcohol dependence. This study also provides a new perspective for the development of new therapeutic strategies for this disease."

The disease is associated with a loss of dopamine-producing cells and a reduction in the number of dopamine-containing neurons in the striatum, the region of the brain that receives dopamine from the substantia nigra and is responsible for the motor symptoms of the disease. Here, we describe a previously unrecognized system of striatonigral fibers that are part of the dopamine-producing system of the brain. These fibers are part of a system of cells and fibers that are likely to be affected in the disease. We suggest that this system is important for the control of movement and motivation.

We asked people to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

This study shows that deforestation can reduce people’s consumption of fruits and vegetables and thus their vitamin A intake. Conversely, forest fragmentation can increase people’s consumption of fruits and vegetables and thus their vitamin A intake. These findings have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. This study also highlights the importance of using causal inference methods to understand the effects of deforestation on people’s diets. This is a relatively new field of research, and we hope that this study will encourage others to use this approach to understand the effects of deforestation on people’s diets. This will help to inform policy makers and practitioners about the importance of natural landscapes in improving people’s diets."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants."
