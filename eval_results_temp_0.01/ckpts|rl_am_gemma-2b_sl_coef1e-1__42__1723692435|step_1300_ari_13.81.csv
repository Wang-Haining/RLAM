However, the structure of ice II-like hydrates, in which the guest molecules are enclathrated in the host lattices, is still unknown. Here, we report the structure of a hydrate, neon hydrate, which is an ice II-like hydrate. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The resolved structure is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. The vibration of Ne atoms is mainly in planes perpendicular to D2O channels, whereas their distributions along the channels are further constrained by interactions between adjacent Ne atoms.

Here, we compare the genomes of two distantly related myxozoans to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results show that the myxozoan degeneration was accompanied by a reduction in genome size and gene content. In addition, we identify candidate genes that are likely to be important for the development of the myxozoan body plan.

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes. Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the host immune response and may help to design new strategies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. Sperm cells are quiescent in the male reproductive system due to Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1 channels, but become active once introduced into the low-Zn2+-concentration environment of the female reproductive tract. How Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide"

However, the extent to which species partition food-plant species is largely unknown because species-level identification is prohibitively difficult with traditional methods. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammal species in semiarid African savanna. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers, and grass consumption was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of % grass consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption, but dietary composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This study demonstrates the utility of DNA metabarcoding for quantifying diet breadth, composition, and overlap, and for identifying the species that comprise diverse assemblages. These findings"

This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered.

In this study, we found that the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis is required for ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells, and that this resistance is mediated by sustained activation of mTORC1 and the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1/stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 axis. Genetic or pharmacologic ablation of mTORC1 or SCD1 sensitized ferroptosis in cancer cells with PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway mutation, and in xenograft mouse models for PI3K-mutated breast cancer and PTEN-defective prostate cancer, the combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction showed therapeutic promise. These findings suggest that ferroptosis-inducing agents may be useful in cancer therapy for patients with PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway mutations. This study also provides a rationale for the combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction in preclinical models.

To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

To achieve accurate results in practice, a large number of trainable parameters are often required. Here, we introduce a network architecture based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice, and automatically adapts to different problems. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data.

Phylogenomic analyses of these datasets resolved controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. We propose that the evolution of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, both major independent origins of specialized herbivory in beetles coincide with the first appearances of an arsenal of PCWDEs encoded in their genomes. These results suggest that beetle diversity may have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding PCWDEs.

This mechanism reduces the required undercooling of iron nucleation, which provides a key factor in solving the inner core nucleation paradox.

To control the pandemic, a large number of people must be vaccinated. To achieve this, a vaccine must be safe, effective, and easy to produce in large quantities. We describe a vaccine that meets these criteria. The vaccine is based on a segment of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein recoded with synonymous suboptimal codons, thereby introducing 283 silent mutations. The furin cleavage site within the spike protein was deleted from the viral genome for added safety of the vaccine strain. The vaccine is temperature sensitive in vitro, yet grows robustly at the permissive temperature. The vaccine generates spike IgG antibody levels and plaque reduction neutralization titers similar to those in hamsters inoculated with wild-type (WT) virus. Upon challenge with WT virus, the vaccine protects hamsters from almost all SARS-CoV-2–associated weight loss. This, coupled with its large-scale manufacturing potential, supports its potential use in mass vaccination programs. The vaccine is a promising candidate for use in the global fight against COVID-19.

The vector of plague during this period is unknown, but it is hypothesized that human ectoparasite vectors, such as fleas or lice, spread the disease. Here, we describe a compartmental model for plague transmission by a human ectoparasite vector. Using Bayesian inference, we found that this model fits mortality curves from nine outbreaks in Europe better than models for rodent or pneumonic transmission. Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346–1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats.

To understand the evolution of brain complexity, we need to know how many neurons were in the brain of the ancestor of our lineage and how many we have today. This study reconstructs the evolution of brain size in amniotes, from the earliest chordates to humans. We show that reptiles have not only small brains relative to body size but also low neuronal densities, resulting in average neuron numbers over 20 times lower than those in birds and mammals of similar body size. This has important implications for studies using relative brain size as a proxy when looking for evolutionary drivers of animal cognition."

TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1 may act as a tumor suppressor in some settings.

The actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin family is the main regulator of actin filament disassembly. However, how it does so in a physiological context, where filaments are interconnected and under mechanical stress, remains unclear. Here, we monitor and quantify the action of ADF/cofilin in different mechanical situations by using single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques, coupled to microfluidics. We find that local curvature favors severing, while tension surprisingly has no effect on cofilin binding and weakly enhances severing. Remarkably, we observe that filament segments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist, experience a mechanical torque upon cofilin binding. We find that this ADF/cofilin-induced torque increases the severing rate constant 100-fold. A consequence of this mechanism is that cross-linked filament networks are severed by cofilin far more efficiently than nonconnected filaments. We propose that this mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells."

We show that RppH decaps Np4 by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to decape other RNAs, and we demonstrate that the unusual manner in which Np4 binds to the active site of RppH positions the δ-phosphate, rather than the β-phosphate, for hydrolytic attack.

SOC systems are characterized by the fact that the larger the activity, the faster the system returns to its critical state. SOC systems are also characterized by the fact that the probability distribution of the activity is a power law. In this paper, we study a continuous model of SOC, which is a certain scaling limit of the sandpile model, the first and archetypical model of SOC. We describe how our model is related to pattern formation and proportional growth phenomena and discuss the dichotomy between continuous and discrete models in several contexts. Our aim in this context is to present an idealized tropical toy model, requiring further investigation."

In this study, we use proteomics to characterize the posttesticular life history of the Drosophila sperm proteome and determine the extent of molecular continuity between males and females. We show that the sperm proteome undergoes substantial compositional changes after being transferred to the female reproductive tract. Multiple seminal fluid proteins initially associate with sperm, but most become undetectable after sperm are stored. Female-derived proteins also begin to associate with sperm immediately after mating, and they comprise nearly 20% of the postmating sperm proteome following 4 d of storage in the female reproductive tract. Female-derived proteins that associate with sperm are enriched for processes associated with energy metabolism, suggesting that female contributions support sperm viability during the prolonged period between copulation and fertilization. Our research provides a comprehensive characterization of sperm proteome dynamics and expands our understanding of the critical process of sperm–FRT interactions. (Show more)"

This mechanism explains the effects of VWD mutations on bleeding. The conversion of single molecule kon (s−1) to bulk phase kon (s−1M−1) and the kon and koff values extrapolated to zero force for the low-force pathways show remarkably good agreement with bulk-phase measurements. This suggests that the single molecule data are not artifacts of the bulk phase. The data also show that the on-rate is faster than previously thought.

However, the ACI is difficult to be well represented in current climate models. This is due to the complexity of the interaction and the lack of observational capability. Here, we introduce a new technique, the dual-field-of-view high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL), to investigate the ACI. The HSRL is capable of simultaneously profiling aerosol and cloud properties, especially cloud microphysical properties. We demonstrate the scientific potential of the HSRL by conducting continuous observations of aerosols and clouds over Beijing. The observations show that the aerosol loading has no discernible effect on the liquid water path but increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius. This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI.

They are also the main targets of drugs. Ion channels are open or closed, and the open probability is determined by the channel’s conformation. Ion channels have two types of gates, one for fast activation/deactivation and the other for slow inactivation/recovery. The activation gate of the K+ channel lacks a classic bundle-crossing structure and normally shows no C-type inactivation/recovery. We found that the K+ channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also found that the K+ channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the K+ channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation.

This is a major change in our understanding of the invasion process and suggests that the malaria parasite is not simply a mechanical system, but rather a system that is constantly adapting to the physical properties of the host cell.

In the temperate regions, seasonal outbreaks of influenza correlate with decreases in ambient humidity. While low humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

We present 17 Yersinia pestis genomes from the Late Neolithic to the Bronze Age, which provide a more complete picture of the pathogen’s evolution and ecology during this period. We show that the plague lineage that gave rise to the modern plague emerged from a Yersinia pseudotuberculosis-like progenitor, and that the pathogen underwent a series of gene losses during its early evolution. We also show that the plague lineage spread across Eurasia, with a rapid expansion in the number of genomes recovered from the Bronze Age. These data provide insights into the early evolution of plague and its ecology during a period of rapid human population growth and migration. (Less)"

Our data indicate that the genetic ancestry of men generally closely resembles modern northern and central Europeans, while women exhibit a very high genetic heterogeneity. This heterogeneity includes signals of genetic ancestry ranging from western Europe to East Asia. In addition, functional variants indicate that women also differed in visible characteristics. This example of female-biased migration indicates that complex demographic processes during the Early Medieval period may have contributed in an unexpected way to shape the modern European genetic landscape. Examination of the panel of functional loci also revealed that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago."

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how HKU4 and HKU5 transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4.

Here, we report the development of an RNA polymerase ribozyme that can synthesize a variety of RNA molecules, including aptamers, ribozymes, and even tRNA. This ribozyme can replicate RNA, amplify short RNA templates, and, in low yield, even synthesize functional RNA molecules. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins.

However, the mechanisms by which hypoxia promotes tumor growth are not fully understood. Here, we show that hypoxia induces expression of AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), an m6A demethylase, which in turn increases the expression of NANOG, a gene that encodes a pluripotency factor. NANOG expression is increased in hypoxic cells, and ALKBH5 overexpression increases the percentage of breast cancer cells that are cancer stem cell-like. Thus, ALKBH5 is a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer. Our findings also suggest that ALKBH5 may be a useful biomarker for identifying breast cancer cells that are resistant to hypoxia. This may be important for the development of new therapeutic strategies for breast cancer. (Read more)"

The source of this parchment has been a long-standing controversy in codicology. Here, we report a simple and objective method for identifying the animal origin of parchment. The method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals, but did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides. These results suggest that ultrafine vellum does not necessarily derive from the use of abortive or newborn animals with ultrathin hides, but could equally well reflect a production process that allowed the skins of maturing animals of several species to be rendered into vellum of equal quality and fineness. This method could be used to identify the animal origin of parchment in the future. (Show more"

The age model for the extinction is critical for understanding its cause and the controls on extinction/recovery dynamics. We present a new age model for the extinction based on U-Pb dating of volcanic ash beds. The age model is refined by a detailed analysis of the carbon cycle and ecosystem recovery. The extinction occurred between 251.941 ± 0.037 and 251.880 ± 0.031 Mya, an interval of 60 ± 48 ka. The carbon cycle volatility persisted for ∼500 ka before a return to near preextinction values. Decamillenial to millennial level resolution of the mass extinction and its aftermath will permit a refined evaluation of the relative roles of rate-dependent processes contributing to the extinction. This will allow insight into postextinction ecosystem expansion, and establish an accurate time point for evaluating the plausibility of trigger and kill mechanisms. The age model will also be useful for the calibration of the geological timescale. This article is protected by copyright."

We show here that monoclonal antibodies targeting the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells.

We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (denoted GlpD) and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA.

It is also one of the most difficult to study, as it is marked by a gradual change in the environment and the lifestyle of the organism. We present a model of the trajectory of plastid genome evolution during the transition from autotrophy to a nonphotosynthetic parasitic lifestyle. We show that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner. Our findings suggest that the rate of molecular evolution in plastid genomes is a sensitive indicator of the evolutionary state of the host organism. This may have important implications for the study of the origin of life and the evolution of the first cells. View Full-Text"

We use a high-resolution large ensemble to quantify the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the probability of occurrence of multiyear rainfall deficits in southwestern South Africa. We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the probability of the 2015–2017 Cape Town drought by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 80% under high-emission scenarios by the year 2100. These results highlight the strong sensitivity of the drought risk in SSA to future anthropogenic emissions. This work emphasizes the need for urgent mitigation efforts to avoid more severe droughts in the future. (Abridged)

Photosynthesis relies on these modified tetrapyrroles for the capture of solar radiation and its conversion to chemical energy. The formation of the isocyclic fifth ring, the key reaction in the biosynthesis of (bacterio)chlorophylls, has remained enigmatic for more than 60 y. This reaction is catalyzed by two unrelated enzymes using different chemistries. The majority of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria use O2-sensitive [4Fe-4S] cluster proteins, whereas plants, cyanobacteria, and some phototrophic bacteria possess an O2-dependent enzyme, the major catalytic component of which is a diiron protein. Plant and cyanobacterial mutants in ycf54 display impaired function of the O2-dependent enzyme, accumulating the reaction substrate. Swapping cyclases between cyanobacteria and purple phototrophic bacteria reveals three classes of the O2-dependent enzyme.

Therefore, it is difficult to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. Our study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral phenotypes of autism-risk genes and suggests that the activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting is a common mechanism for autism-risk genes. This study also provides a framework for identifying the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

We show that aggregates accumulate at synaptic terminals and progressively spread throughout the brain. These aggregates are internalized and accumulate within other neurons. We also show that the release of aggregates requires N-ethylmalemide–sensitive fusion protein 1, demonstrating that active release and uptake of aggregates are important elements of spreading and disease progression.

However, the immunosuppressant protein (MTX) in bats has been shown to be a potential virulence factor in viral infection. Here, we identified and characterized MTX, a potent immunosuppressant protein in the submandibular salivary gland of the bat, Myotis pilosus. MTX inhibits the antiviral responses of the host and facilitates viral infection. MTX has no effect on the aminopeptidase function of leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) and therefore does not impair the antiinflammatory function of LTA4H. MTX potently inhibits proinflammatory proteases to induce immune tolerance and maintain high stability. This study provides deeper insight into immunologically privileged sites for microbial community residence in bats and supports the therapeutic potential of targeting MTX-LTA4H.

We identify small-molecule dual inhibitors of human SHMT1/2, and show that they block SHMT enzymatic activity in both the cytosol and mitochondria. We also show that formate, a one-carbon donor, rescues cells from SHMT inhibition, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We show that this effect is rooted in defective glycine uptake in DLBCL cell lines, rendering them uniquely dependent upon SHMT enzymatic activity to meet glycine demand. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of DLBCL. This work provides a rationale for targeting SHMT in cancer, and in particular, in DLBCL.

Rather, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. This may explain the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in the brain and spinal cord. (Read more)"

The glycan is then catabolized by the symbiont, which is thus provided with a specific nutrient at a specific time of day.

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis remain unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We found that pol II stalling at O2-EtdT and N3-EtdT sites is exacerbated by TFIIS-stimulated proofreading activity. Assessment for the impact of the EtdT lesions on individual fidelity checkpoints provided further mechanistic insights, where the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion. For the N3-EtdT lesion that disrupts base pairing, multiple transcriptional lesion bypass routes were"

To understand how MERS-CoV infects humans, we engineered MERS viruses with mutations that blocked sequential proteolysis. These mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence. These findings also suggest that the first cleavages may be significant determinants of other coronaviruses that cause severe pneumonia. Therefore, the first cleavages may be important targets for antiviral development."

It is therefore a critical target for cancer cells to remodel in order to evade the immune system and to grow and metastasize. Here we apply a quantitative proteomics approach to show how the surfaceome is remodeled in a collection of six of the most prominent oncogenes, including receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR and HER2, and downstream signaling partners such as KRAS and BRAF. We find that each oncogene has somewhat different surfaceomes, but the functions of these proteins are harmonized by common biological themes including up-regulation of nutrient transporters, down-regulation of adhesion molecules and tumor suppressing phosphatases, and alteration in immune modulators. These studies provide a broad systems-level view of how specific driver oncogenes remodel the surfaceome and the glycoproteome in a cell autologous fashion, and suggest possible surface targets, and combinations thereof, for drug and biomarker discovery. This work also suggests that the surfaceome may be a useful biomarker for the presence of driver oncogenes.

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive design-based analysis of the effect of universal vote-by-mail—a policy under which every voter is mailed a ballot in advance of the election—on electoral outcomes. We find that universal vote-by-mail does not appear to affect either party’s share of turnout, does not appear to increase either party’s vote share, and modestly increases overall average turnout rates. All three conclusions support the conventional wisdom of election administration experts and contradict many popular claims in the media. Our findings suggest that vote-by-mail programs are not likely to have a significant impact on the 2020 presidential election.

In coordination with endogenous FOXC2 in fibroblasts, transduced ETV2 elicits expression of multiple key endothelial development factors, including FLI1, ERG, and TAL1, and induces expression of endothelial functional molecules, including EGFL7 and von Willebrand factor. Consequently, ETVECs exhibits EC characteristics in vitro and forms mature functional vasculature in Matrigel plugs transplanted in NOD SCID mice.

Chemotherapy is the most common treatment for breast cancer, but many patients do not respond well to it. We found that the expression of the type I tyrosine kinaselike orphan receptor ROR1 increased in breast cancer cells following treatment with chemotherapy. We also found that treatment of mice bearing breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) with the humanized anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab repressed expression of genes associated with breast cancer stemness, reduced activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or BMI1, and impaired the capacity of breast cancer PDXs to metastasize or reengraft Rag2−/−γc−/− mice. These results indicate that targeting ROR1 may improve the response to chemotherapy of patients with breast cancer. This approach may also be useful for patients with other types of cancer.

We show that the start of deglaciation is instead linked to a volcanic eruption, which led to stratospheric ozone depletion and a unique Southern Hemisphere climate pattern that plausibly triggered deglaciation. This study demonstrates that volcanic eruptions can have a strong influence on climate and that the climate system is sensitive to small changes in solar activity. This is important for understanding the climate system and its response to anthropogenic climate change. The Mount Takahe eruption is the most distant volcanic eruption in the instrumental record to be linked to climate change. The eruption occurred at the start of a period of rapid climate change, which is similar to the present day. This study also highlights the importance of volcanic monitoring and early warning systems. Volcanic eruptions are a natural hazard, but they can also have a significant impact on climate.

Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

Moreover, subjects with increased gut permeability also had altered composition and activity of the gut microbiota. These results suggest the existence of a gut–brain axis in alcohol dependence, which implicates the gut microbiota as an actor in the gut barrier and in behavioral disorders.

This study demonstrates that FTs can function as an important interplant flowering signal in host–parasite interactions. The unique means of flowering regulation of dodder illustrates how regressive evolution, commonly found in parasites, may facilitate the physiological synchronization of parasite and host, here allowing the C. australis parasite to time reproduction exactly with that of their hosts, likely optimizing parasite fitness. This study also shows that FTs can be used as a tool to synchronize flowering of different species. This may be useful for the development of new crop varieties with a synchronized flowering time.

For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Finally, we demonstrate that this signal is used by third-party listeners as a heuristic of how well people are connected: Conversations with faster response times were perceived as more connected than the same conversations with slower response times. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

Cardiac-specific deletion of STIM1 in mice resulted in depletion of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ stores of SAN cells and led to SAN dysfunction, as was evident by a reduction in heart rate, sinus arrest, and an exaggerated autonomic response to cholinergic signaling. Moreover, STIM1 influenced SAN function by regulating ionic fluxes in SAN cells, including activation of a store-operated Ca2+ current, a reduction in L-type Ca2+ current, and enhancing the activities of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger.

We show that the firing rate of neurons can be reduced by the activity of other neurons, and that this mechanism can support memory on timescales ranging from milliseconds to seconds. This work provides a computational neurobiology of language that is based on the adaptive properties of neurons. It also suggests a mechanism for the binding of linguistic features over time. This work is a step toward a computational neurobiology of language."

We show that the size, shape, compactness, stiffness, and attachment location of the DNA nanostructure are important design parameters for the delivery of siRNA to plants. We also show that the delivery of siRNA to plants is dependent on the endogenous gene silencing pathway. Our work establishes the feasibility of delivering biomolecules to plants with DNA nanostructures and also details the design parameters of importance for plant cell internalization and also assesses the impact of DNA nanostructure geometry for gene silencing mechanisms.

In the United States, the majority of nutrient pollution comes from small tributaries that drain surrounding watersheds. However, decades of monitoring and regulatory efforts have focused on large water bodies, leaving small tributaries largely unaddressed. We show that small tributaries can be a significant source of coastal nutrient pollution, especially in large water bodies. Our findings highlight the importance of small tributaries in driving coastal eutrophication and suggest that nutrient management efforts should be expanded to include these often-overlooked sources. Our study also demonstrates the value of a snapshot approach to understanding the spatial distribution of coastal nutrient inputs. This approach can be used to identify the most important sources of coastal pollution and prioritize future monitoring and management efforts. (Less)"

We find that the long-time dynamics of such systems are biased toward states that exhibit a fine-tuned extremization of environmental forcing. This behavior is reminiscent of the “fine-tuning problem” in cosmology, where the rare combination of initial conditions is required to produce the observed universe. Our results suggest that the fine-tuning of the chemical network may be a necessary condition for the origin of the universe."

Here we show that NMDAR-Abs change the intrinsic microcircuitry of the cortex, which in turn alters the spectral composition of spontaneous EEG activity. We then show that these changes are critical for the development of overt EEG paroxysms. These findings offer mechanistic insights into the circuit-level dysfunction induced by NMDAR-Abs. They also suggest that the same key parameters that are altered by NMDAR-Abs may be susceptible to small fluctuations in the control condition, which could explain why some patients do not develop paroxysmal EEG abnormalities. This may also explain why some patients respond to treatment by removing the antibody. Finally, our findings suggest that NMDAR-Abs may not be the only cause of paroxysmal EEG abnormalities. Other antibodies, or even drugs, may also change cortical microcircuitry in a similar way. This may explain why some patients with paroxysmal EEG abnormalities do not respond to treatment with NMDAR-Abs.

Certification is the primary tool used by companies and governments to reduce this loss, but the impact of certification on deforestation and fire remains unclear. We show that certification is associated with reduced deforestation in oil palm plantations, but that most plantations are too small to have a significant impact on deforestation. Certification also had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results suggest that certification is not yet a viable tool for reducing deforestation in Indonesia. (Show more)"

In species with polygenic sex determination, multiple alleles interact to produce the sex of an individual. In some species, the sex of an individual can be decoupled from the sex of the gonads. Here we investigate the effects of polygenic sex determination on secondary sexual characteristics in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii. We find that the interaction of multiple alleles results in modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics, including genital morphology, craniofacial morphology, gastrointestinal morphology, and behavior. These results suggest that polygenic sex determination can produce a diversity of secondary sexual characteristics, which may be important for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of the maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations. This work also provides a case study of the effects of polygenic sex determination on secondary sexual characteristics."

They are considered a model system for studying the evolution of specialization in predators. However, the evolution of specialization in this group has been studied in a single dimension, focusing on the evolution of the morphology of the tentacles. Here we study the evolution of specialization in siphonophores in a broader context, by focusing on the evolution of the nematocysts, the specialized structures that are used to capture prey. We show that the evolution of specialization in siphonophores is linked to the evolution of the nematocysts, and that the evolution of specialization is not a dead end. Our findings contribute to understanding how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs."

We also show that the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods. This suggests that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, calling for ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, that must have guided these prehistoric giants.
