However, the structure of hydrate at high pressure and temperature is still not well understood. In this work, we report the structure of neon hydrate at high pressure and temperature. The structure is found to be ice II-structured, which is different from the conventional ice Ih-structured hydrates. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. This work provides a new route to study the structure of hydrate at high pressure and temperature. It also provides a new way to enclathrate guest molecules in ice. This work is expected to provide a new perspective for the study of hydrate and ice. (Show more)"

The evolutionary origin of the myxozoan body plan is enigmatic, and the group is thought to have evolved from a free-living cnidarian. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the genomes of two myxozoans and a cnidarian parasite. Our results show that the myxozoan body plan is reduced in complexity relative to that of a free-living cnidarian, and that the group has undergone a dramatic reduction in genome size. These results suggest that the transition from a free-living to a parasitic lifestyle was accompanied by a reduction in genome size and gene content.

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes. Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This mechanism could be used as a target for antiviral therapy. Our findings could also be used to understand the mechanism of action of other viruses that use the same strategy to evade the host immune response. This knowledge could"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1.

We quantify the magnitude of this yield variability and its consequences for global maize production and trade. We find that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields will increase to values much larger than present-day values in most major maize-producing and -exporting countries. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields. The probability that they have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. They also underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance."

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is largely unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa in the field. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large herbivores in semiarid African savanna. We found that species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption had the greatest overlap in diet. Nonetheless, species differed in their proportional grass consumption, and dietary overlap was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This study highlights the importance of using DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth and composition in natural assemblages of herbivores. This approach will be increasingly important as the use of DNA metabarcoding increases in ecology and conservation."

However, the magnitude of the problem is still debated. We show that the global load of floating plastic debris is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This discrepancy is explained by the selective removal of small plastic fragments by the ocean interior. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean. This work is a first step toward a better understanding of the global distribution of floating plastic debris. It is also a call for more research on this topic.

We determined the ages of 40 large presolar silicon carbide grains extracted from the Murchison CM2 meteorite. The grains have ages of &lt;300 Ma and are therefore younger than the theoretical age of the solar system. This indicates that the solar system formed from the aggregation of interstellar dust particles. Furthermore, we found that the grains acquired the bulk of their cosmogenic nuclides in the interstellar medium and not by exposure to an enhanced particle flux of the early active sun.

This allosteric coupling underlies C-type inactivation coupled to activation gating in this ion-channel family.

A Threonine to Alanine substitution at this position was studied in three representative members of the K+-channel family. Interestingly, all of the mutant channels exhibited lack of C-type inactivation gating and an inversion of their allosteric coupling (i.e., closing of the activation gate collapses the channel’s selectivity filter).

The hemoglobin system is also a target of the let-7 miRNA pathway. Here we show that the insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) is a downstream element of the let-7 pathway and that it plays a role in the chronoregulation of hemoglobin expression in humans. We show that IGF2BP1 mediates posttranscriptional loss of the transcription factor BCL11A, which is essential for fetal hemoglobin expression. These results suggest a mechanism for chronoregulation of hemoglobin expression in humans. This mechanism may be relevant to the hemoglobin phenotypes observed in patients with hemoglobinopathies and in individuals with aging-related changes in hemoglobin expression. This work also provides a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of hemoglobinopathies. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)."

This resistance is mediated by sustained activation of mTORC1 and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)C1-dependent induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. In this study, we show that inhibition of mTORC1 sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis induction, and that ectopic expression of SREBP1 or stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) restores ferroptosis resistance. In preclinical models, combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction resulted in near-complete tumor regression. These findings suggest that mTORC1 inhibition may be combined with ferroptosis induction to treat cancer.

Our results are relevant for the study of quantum quenches in general, and for the understanding of the thermodynamics of interacting systems in particular."

The only vaccine currently in clinical development is the one developed by our group. We describe the vaccine, its manufacturing process, and its potential use in mass vaccination programs. The vaccine is based on a segment of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein recoded with synonymous suboptimal codons, thereby introducing 283 silent mutations. The furin cleavage site within the spike protein was deleted from the viral genome for added safety of the vaccine strain. The vaccine is temperature sensitive in vitro yet grows robustly at the permissive temperature. The vaccine generates spike IgG antibody levels and plaque reduction neutralization titers similar to those in hamsters inoculated with the wild-type virus. Upon challenge with the wild-type virus, the vaccine reduced lung challenge viral titers, resulted in undetectable virus in the brain, and protected hamsters from almost all SARS-CoV-2–associated weight loss. The vaccine is highly attenuated and is protective at a single intranasal dose in a relevant in vivo model. This, coupled with its large-scale manufacturing potential, supports its potential use in mass vaccination programs. The vaccine is the only one currently in clinical development. It"

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal and transformed cells is more complex than previously appreciated. We have shown that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This study provides a mechanistic explanation for the anticancer activity of TRAP1 inhibitors and suggests that TRAP1 may be a useful target for cancer therapy.

They are dynamic polymers that can be assembled and disassembled. The disassembly process is controlled by the actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin family of proteins. These proteins are the central regulators of actin filament disassembly. However, how they do so in a physiological context, where filaments are interconnected and under mechanical stress, remains unclear. Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to monitor and quantify the action of ADF/cofilin in different mechanical situations. We find that local curvature favors severing, while tension surprisingly has no effect on cofilin binding and weakly enhances severing. Remarkably, we observe that filament segments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist, experience a mechanical torque upon cofilin binding. We find that this ADF/cofilin-induced torque does not hinder ADF/cofilin binding, but dramatically enhances severing. A simple model, which faithfully recapitulates our experimental observations, indicates that the ADF/cofilin-induced torque increases the severing rate constant 100-fold.

Here, we assemble the overall biomass composition of the biosphere, establishing a census of the ≈550 Gt C of biomass distributed among all of the kingdoms of life. We find that the kingdoms of life concentrate at different locations on the planet; plants (≈450 Gt C, the dominant kingdom) are primarily terrestrial, whereas animals (≈2 Gt C) are mainly marine, and bacteria (≈70 Gt C) and archaea (≈7 Gt C) are predominantly located in deep subsurface environments. We show that the global marine biomass pyramid contains more consumers than producers, thus increasing the scope of previous observations on inverse food pyramids. Finally, we highlight that the mass of humans is an order of magnitude higher than that of all wild mammals combined and report the historical impact of humanity on the global biomass of prominent taxa, including mammals, fish, and plants. Our results provide a global view of the biomass of the biosphere and its distribution among the kingdoms of life. They"

They open and close their pore gates to regulate ion flow. The pore gates are usually located at the intracellular end of the channel. However, the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks an intracellular activation gate and normally shows no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. Our findings provide a new perspective on the regulation of ion flow by ion channels. They also provide a molecular mechanism for the BK channel’s unique properties.

In the temperate regions, seasonal influenza outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in ambient humidity. While low ambient humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes them more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

This pattern of activity is consistent with a neural implementation of a merge operation, which applies equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity.

We find that it can avoid an excess mortality rate of 3.61 million per year from outdoor air pollution worldwide.

Globally, fossil-fuel-related emissions account for about 65% of the excess mortality, and 70% of the climate cooling by anthropogenic aerosols. Aerosols affect the hydrologic cycle, contributing to water and food security. Since aerosols mask the anthropogenic rise in global temperature, removing fossil-fuel-generated particles liberates 0.51 °C and all pollution particles 0.73 °C warming, reaching around 2 °C over North America and Northeast Asia. The steep temperature increase from removing aerosols can be moderated to about 0.36 °C globally by the simultaneous reduction of tropospheric ozone and methane. We conclude that a rapid phaseout of fossil-fuel-related emissions and major reductions of other anthropogenic sources are needed to save millions of lives, restore aerosol-perturbed rainfall patterns, and limit global warming to 2 °C."

We report a variant of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 that exhibits enhanced immunogenicity and cross-reactivity with variants of concern. This engineered RBD can be expressed on a virus-like particle, which reduces weight loss in hamsters upon viral challenge. This engineered RBD can be used in a variety of vaccine platforms, including subunit vaccines and VLPs, to provide a more effective vaccine against COVID-19.

Our results provide evidence for the involvement of ALKALs in the regulation of neural crest development in vivo. This study contributes to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of ALK family RTKs and their ligands in vivo. It also provides a model system for the study of ALKALs in human diseases.

We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. First, whereas MERS-CoV prefers human DPP4 over bat DPP4 as its receptor, HKU4 shows the opposite trend. Second, in the absence of exogenous proteases, both MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes mediate pseudovirus entry into bat cells, whereas only MERS-CoV spike, but not HKU4 spike, mediates pseudovirus entry into human cells. Thus, MERS-CoV, but not HKU4, has adapted to use human cells for efficient human cell entry, contributing to the enhanced pathogenesis of MERS-CoV in humans. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat"

In this paper, we show that stratospheric water vapor is an important component of the climate system. We show that stratospheric water vapor increases with tropospheric temperature, and we estimate the strength of this relationship. We also show that the increase in stratospheric water vapor is due to the increase in water vapor entering the stratosphere through the tropical tropopause layer. This finding is important because it shows that the tropical tropopause layer is an important region for the climate system."

However, some vertebrates have distinctive blue-green colors, which are caused by unusually high concentrations of biliverdin, a pigment that is normally present in the blood. We show that the occurrence of high biliverdin in anurans (frogs and toads) has evolved multiple times during their evolutionary history, and relies on the same mechanism—the presence of a class of serpin family proteins that bind biliverdin. Our results provide molecular and functional evidence of recurrent evolution of chlorosis, describe a biliverdin-binding protein in vertebrates, and introduce a function for a member of the serpin superfamily, the largest and most ubiquitous group of protease inhibitors.

However, the mechanisms that regulate the hypoxic phenotype in breast cancer are not well understood. We show that hypoxia induces expression of AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), which in turn increases the expression of NANOG, a gene that encodes a breast cancer stem cell factor. ALKBH5 expression is induced by hypoxia through the HIF-1α and HIF-2α pathways. NANOG expression is increased in a NANOG 3′-UTR-dependent manner, and ALKBH5 mutation in this region abrogates this effect. Thus, ALKBH5 expression in response to hypoxia is a mechanism that regulates the breast cancer stem cell phenotype. This study provides a mechanism for the induction of the hypoxic phenotype in breast cancer. It also provides a rationale for the use of ALKBH5 inhibitors in the treatment of breast cancer.

However, despite considerable scientific attention in recent decades, the overall response of soil respiration to anticipated climatic warming remains unclear. We synthesize the largest global dataset to date of soil respiration, moisture, and temperature measurements, totaling &gt;3,800 observations representing 27 temperature manipulation studies, spanning nine biomes and over 2 decades of warming. Our analysis reveals no significant differences in the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration between control and warmed plots in all biomes, with the exception of deserts and boreal forests. Thus, our data provide limited evidence of acclimation of soil respiration to experimental warming in several major biome types, contrary to the results from multiple single-site studies. Our analysis adds a unique cross-biome perspective on the temperature response of soil respiration, information critical to improving our mechanistic understanding of how soil carbon dynamics change with climatic warming. This work is a step toward a better understanding of the role of soil respiration in the global carbon cycle and its response to climate change."

We present a model of the trajectory of plastid genome evolution during the transition to a parasitic lifestyle. We show that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner. During the functional reduction process, the elevation of evolutionary rates reaches several new rate equilibria, possibly relating to the modified protein turnover rates in heterotrophic plastids. Our findings suggest that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner.

We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% by the year 2100 under an intermediate-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5 [SSP2-4.5]) and to 80% under a high-emission scenario (SSP5-8.5). These results highlight the strong sensitivity of the drought risk in SSA to future anthropogenic emissions.

Swapping cyclases between cyanobacteria and purple phototrophic bacteria reveals three classes of the diiron enzyme. A diiron enzyme in Rubrivivax gelatinosus is required for photosynthesis, whereas alphaproteobacterial cyclases require a newly discovered protein that we term BciE, encoded by a gene conserved in these organisms.

This conclusion is consistent with the fact that the 2012–2014 drought was preceded by several years of warm conditions.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. As an alternative approach, extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying the convergence of the targets and functions of the autism-risk genes to facilitate mapping out causal paths. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility in autism and suggests a potential therapeutic target.

There is no specific antiviral treatment for MERS, and the high mortality rate of the disease stresses the need for the availability of effective antiviral treatments. Here, we show that remdesivir, an investigational broad-spectrum antiviral drug, is effective in preventing and treating MERS-CoV infection in a nonhuman primate model. This study supports the further development of remdesivir as a treatment for MERS and other coronaviruses. It may also be considered for a wider range of viruses, including the currently emerging novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV. This study provides a proof of concept for the use of remdesivir in the treatment of viral diseases caused by enveloped viruses. The results may also be relevant for the development of antiviral treatments for other diseases caused by enveloped viruses."

However, the mechanisms by which this is achieved are not well understood. Here, we show that the provision of a single glycan to a symbiotic bacterium is sufficient to regulate the persistence of the entire symbiosis. This glycan is catabolized by the symbiont only at night, when the host squid is active and the symbiont is producing light. This glycan-catabolizing activity is required for the periodic acidification of the crypts, which increases the availability of oxygen to the symbionts. This study provides a mechanistic link between glycan provision and the regulation of the health of the symbiotic system. It also suggests that other hosts may use this strategy to regulate the activities of their associated microbes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)."

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis remain unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We found that pol II stalling at O2-EtdT and N3-EtdT sites is exacerbated by TFIIS-stimulated proofreading activity. Assessment for the impact of the EtdT lesions on individual fidelity checkpoints provided further mechanistic insights, where the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas the more rigid uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into endos"

Vote-by-mail modestly increases overall average turnout rates, in line with previous estimates. All three conclusions support the conventional wisdom of election administration experts and contradict many popular claims in the media. Our results suggest that vote-by-mail is not a panacea for the problems of election administration. Rather, it is a tool that can be used to improve the efficiency of the electoral process.

Our study highlights the importance of maintaining the balance between tumor growth and microbiome regulation. It also provides a mechanistic understanding of the role of the microbiome in tumorigenesis. This study has implications for understanding the role of the microbiome in cancer development and progression.

The treatment of breast cancer with chemotherapy may lead to the emergence of cancer stem cells or tumor-initiating cells, which have an enhanced capacity for self-renewal, tumor initiation, and/or metastasis. In this study, we found that the expression of the type I tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor ROR1 increased in breast cancer cells following treatment with chemotherapy. We also found that ROR1 enhanced the capacity of breast cancer cells to invade Matrigel, form spheroids, engraft in Rag2−/−γc−/− mice, or survive treatment with paclitaxel. Finally, we found that treatment of mice bearing breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) with the humanized anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab repressed expression of genes associated with breast cancer stemness, reduced activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or BMI1, and impaired the capacity of breast cancer PDXs to metastasize or reengraft Rag2−/−γc−/− mice.

Here, we demonstrate that DNA nanostructures can be used to deliver biomolecules across the cell wall of plants. We show that the size, shape, compactness, stiffness, and attachment location of the DNA nanostructures are important design parameters for plant cell internalization and gene silencing. This work establishes the feasibility of DNA nanostructures for biomolecule delivery to plants and also details the design parameters of importance for gene silencing mechanisms.

However, decades of monitoring and regulatory efforts have focused on large watersheds, leaving small tributaries largely unmonitored. We show that small tributaries can be a significant source of nutrients to large water bodies, especially in nearshore areas. Our findings suggest that nutrient management efforts should be expanded to small watersheds, which are often overlooked in watershed management plans. This could reduce the ecological impacts of nutrient loading on valuable nearshore ecosystems. Our study also highlights the importance of bioavailability in determining the potential for nutrients to fuel algal blooms. This is especially important in large water bodies, where the nutrient-enriched plumes can become trapped and then overlap in the nearshore zone.

We find that the long-time dynamics of such systems are biased toward states that exhibit a fine-tuned extremization of environmental forcing. This behavior is reminiscent of the “saddle-node” bifurcation, which is a well-known phenomenon in dynamical systems. We also find that the dynamics of the network are sensitive to the details of the environmental forcing, and that the system can exhibit a rich variety of behaviors depending on the details of the forcing. This work provides a simple example of how the dynamics of a simple chemical network can be strongly influenced by the details of the environment. This is an important step toward understanding the role of the environment in the dynamics of complex systems."

However, the history of abrupt climate change is poorly understood because of the difficulty in identifying and quantifying these events. Here, we use a combination of proxies and modeling to identify and quantify an abrupt climate change event that occurred during a glacial period. We show that this event was associated with a doubling of atmospheric CO2 and a biodiversity nadir. The event was linked to an injection of organic matter–derived carbon into the ocean and to anoxia of the ocean floor. We also show that this event was linked to a warming of the ocean and that this warming was associated with enhanced nutrient fluxes. These results provide insights into the mechanisms that control the timing and magnitude of abrupt climate change. (Show more)"

Certification is the tool most used to fulfill these procurement policies, and around 20% of global palm oil production is certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). However, the effect of certification on deforestation in oil palm plantations remains unclear. Here, we show that certification is associated with reduced deforestation in Indonesia, the leading producer of palm oil. Nevertheless, most plantations contained little residual forest when they received certification. As a result, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. This study is a first step in understanding the impact of certification on deforestation in oil palm plantations. However, the results are limited to the Indonesian context and do not address the impact of certification on deforestation in other commodities or countries. Future studies should address these limitations"

It is conserved from bacteria to humans. In humans, its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. The exocyst complex is difficult to study in humans because of its complexity and the lack of a human model organism. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 (exocyst component of 70 kDa) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease.

Here we show that the sex of a fish can be determined by multiple alleles of a single gene, and we show that this system can produce a variety of sex phenotypes. This system provides a unique context for understanding the causes and consequences of sex determination alleles in populations."

In this study, we show that the nutrient iron (Fe) is a key player in these processes. We demonstrate that the accumulation of toxic species is reduced in mice with reduced Fe levels. This reduction is mediated by the Fe chelator deferiprone, which decreases the oxidation and degradation of a toxic species, A2E, in the presence of light.

These findings suggest that shifts between prey types are linked to shifts in the morphology, mode of evolution, and evolutionary correlations of tentilla and their nematocysts. The evolutionary history of siphonophore specialization helps build a broader perspective on predatory niche diversification via morphological innovation and evolution.

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants.
