In this work, we report the synthesis and structure of neon hydrate at high pressure and temperature. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The structure of neon hydrate is stable at 480 MPa and 260 K, which is the highest pressure and temperature for the synthesis of hydrate. This work provides a new way to study the structure of hydrate at high pressure and temperature. It also provides a new way to study the transport of guest molecules in hydrate. (Show more)"

Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we present the first genomic and transcriptomic data for two myxozoan species, and we compare these to the transcriptome and genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. These results have implications for understanding the evolution of parasitism and the origin of the parasitic lifestyle. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to block the nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are essential for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We found that the SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its ability to antagonize the antiviral action of IFN. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. Our findings may help to design antiviral strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses that use similar mechanisms to evade the host immune system. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources at the level of individual species is unknown. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large herbivore species in semiarid African savanna. We found that, despite being similar in body size and proportional grass consumption, species differed in their diet composition, and that dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages, and that large herbivore diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results also highlight the need for more comprehensive species-level diet analyses in future studies of large herbivore diets and their effects on biodiversity."

This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data. The proposed architecture is easy to implement, train, and apply in practice, and can be used in a wide range of problems.

These genes were acquired multiple times, and the evolution of specialized feeding habits was accompanied by a diversification of beetles. Our results suggest that the evolution of beetles was driven by multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms, and the adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding enzymes that enable the digestion of plant cell walls.

TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor.

These results are important for understanding the history of Madagascar and the Indian Ocean. They also have implications for the study of human migration and the role of geography in shaping the genetic structure of human populations. (Less)"

In bacteria, they are thought to function as precursors to nucleoside tetraphosphate (Np4) RNA caps. In this study, we show that the decapping enzyme responsible for removing this cap is inactivated by the very conditions of disulfide stress that enable Np4-capped RNAs to accumulate to high levels. We also show that this enzyme, which is normally inactive under these conditions, prefers to remove capped substrates over their counterparts that are tri- or diphosphorylated. The unique manner in which capped substrates of this kind bind to the active site of the enzyme positions the δ-phosphate, rather than the β-phosphate, for hydrolytic attack, generating triphosphorylated RNA as the primary product of decapping. This study reveals a mechanism for how a single enzyme can have differential impact on the rates at which capped and uncapped 5′ termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation. Such a mechanism could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress. (Show more)"

In the temperate regions, seasonal influenza virus outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in humidity. While low ambient humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our study provides mechanistic insights into the impact of low humidity on influenza virus infection and disease outcome. It also provides a rationale for the development of strategies to mitigate the impact of low humidity on influenza-associated morbidity and mortality. This article is protected"

We connect changes in the physical appearance of five US cities with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities. Our work also provides a new way to measure the physical appearance of neighborhoods, which is an important metric for urban planning and policy."

However, the mechanisms by which pathogens influence the microbiota are poorly understood. Here, we show that a human pathogen, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, modifies the gut microbiota of the vector, Ixodes scapularis, to more efficiently colonize the tick. We identify a protein, antifreeze glycoprotein, that is expressed by the vector and is critical for Anaplasma colonization. We show that the protein alters the integrity of the gut barrier and the peritrophic matrix, which are critical obstacles for pathogen colonization. Mechanistically, the protein binds the terminal d-alanine residue of the bacterial peptidoglycan cell wall, resulting in altered permeability and the capacity of bacteria to form biofilms. These data elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which a human pathogen appropriates an arthropod antibacterial protein to alter the gut microbiota and more effectively colonize the vector. This work provides a framework for understanding the role of the microbiota in pathogen colonization of arthropod vectors. (Show more)"

Here, we report a simple and objective method to identify the animal origin of parchment. The noninvasive method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period.

This antibody is capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. These results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. Furthermore, our results suggest that IL1RAP may be a promising target for antibody-based therapy in other diseases where IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of tumor cells.

As an alternative approach, extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying the convergence of the targets and functions of the autism-risk genes to facilitate mapping out causal paths. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies.

The most recent common ancestor of all B19V has been dated to the early 1800s, and it has been suggested that genotype 1, the most common B19V genotype, only started circulating in the 1960s. Here we present 10 ancient B19V genomes (∼0.5–6.9 thousand years ago) and show that B19V has been associated with humans for a long time. We also show that the recombination event that formed genotype 2 occurred ∼5.0–6.8 thousand years ago. This study emphasizes the importance of ancient viral sequences for our understanding of virus evolution and phylogenetics. (Show more)"

We found that the three regioisomeric EtdT lesions can be bypassed by pol II in a sequence-dependent manner. The transcriptional lesion bypass routes are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop). The Pro-Gate loop faces toward the minor groove of RNA:DNA hybrid and is involved in modulating the translocation of minor-groove alkylated DNA template after nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion.

These conformational changes are required for the second fusion-activating cleavage, which is essential for virus entry into cells. Thus, the first S proteolysis expands virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence.

We connect changes in the physical appearance of five US cities with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

The mechanisms of disease are not fully understood, but the dynamics of the virus within the host may play an important role. Here we present a mathematical model of the within-host dynamics of ZIKV, allowing for characterization of the growth and clearance of ZIKV within individual macaques. We show that the time between cell infection and viral production is likely short, the rate of viral production is rapid, and the lifetime of an infected cell while producing virus is ∼5 h. We also show that an antiviral treatment that blocks viral replication can reduce the time to undetectable plasma viral load. Finally, we show that a drug given at the time of infection can reduce the peak median viral load and shorten the time to undetectable median viral load. These results can help guide the development of effective antiviral strategies for the control of ZIKV infection. (Show more)"

This shift from nutrient uptake to release by the coral host is a key factor in the breakdown of the symbiosis and may help to explain the observed resilience of some coral species. Our results provide a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help to predict the fate of coral reefs in a warming world."

Network function was assessed by quantifying the expression of the dominant RSN in cerebral blood flow. In healthy subjects and early Parkinson’s disease, the dominant RSN was deactivated during rest. In contrast, in advanced Parkinson’s disease, the dominant RSN was activated during rest.

However, the delivery of biomolecules to plants is a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate that DNA nanostructures can be used to deliver biomolecules to plants, and we show that the size, shape, and geometry of the DNA nanostructures are important for the delivery and gene silencing efficiencies. Our work establishes the feasibility of delivering biomolecules to plants with DNA nanostructures and also details the design parameters of importance for plant cell internalization and also assesses the impact of DNA nanostructure geometry for gene silencing mechanisms.

However, the relative importance of the many small tributaries that drain into these lakes is unknown. We show that the majority of the nutrients that fuel coastal algal blooms come from a small number of large tributaries, but that the nutrients from smaller tributaries are more bioavailable and may be more important for fueling algal blooms in the nearshore zone. Our findings highlight the need to consider the role of small tributaries in coastal eutrophication, especially in large lakes, and to develop strategies to manage nutrient inputs from these areas."

However, most studies focused on short-term warming events that were superimposed on longer-term greenhouse climate states. Here, we present an integrated proxy (C and uranium [U] isotopes and paleo CO2) and multicomponent modeling approach to investigate an abrupt C perturbation and global warming event (∼304 Ma) that occurred during a paleo-glacial state. We report pronounced negative C and U isotopic excursions coincident with a doubling of atmospheric CO2 partial pressure and a biodiversity nadir. The isotopic excursions can be linked to an injection of organic matter–derived C over 300 kyr and to near 20% of areal extent of seafloor anoxia. Earth system modeling indicates that widespread anoxic conditions can be linked to enhanced thermocline stratification and increased nutrient fluxes during this global warming within an icehouse. This work provides a new perspective on the history of C perturbation events and the potential for global warming events in the Earth system."

Our results suggest that certification is most effective in reducing deforestation in areas that are already deforested, and that certification is not effective in reducing deforestation in peatlands or active fire. These findings highlight the need for certification to be used in combination with other tools to reduce tropical deforestation."

Investigation of the dynamic regulation of the exocyst-related processes using mutants in genetically tractable organisms such as Arabidopsis thaliana is limited by the lethality or the severity of phenotypes. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the exocyst component EXO70, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

In many species, the sex of an individual is determined by a single genetic locus. In others, the sex of an individual is determined by multiple interacting loci, resulting in a spectrum of sex classes. Here we investigate the effects of multiple interacting sex determination alleles on the evolution of secondary sexual characteristics. We find that multiple alleles of a sex determination system can produce modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics, and that the modularity of secondary sexual characteristics can be used to track the evolution of new alleles. These results have implications for understanding the evolution of sex determination and the maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations. (Less)"

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants."
