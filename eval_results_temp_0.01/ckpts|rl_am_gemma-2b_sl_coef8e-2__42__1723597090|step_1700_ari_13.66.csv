The virus responsible for this disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is able to evade the antiviral action of the immune system by blocking the nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are essential for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 uses a viral accessory protein, Orf6, to block nuclear import of the STAT1 and STAT2 proteins. We also show that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1, a protein complex that is essential for nuclear import. Our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. Our findings provide a mechanistic understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the antiviral action of IFN and could be used to design new strategies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

We find that zinc binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These results provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how zinc inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant African LMH species. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers. Grass consumption inferred from DNA was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of % grass consumption, indicating that DNA metabarcoding can be used to quantify consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results highlight the need for more comprehensive, species-level diet analyses in future studies of LMH ecology and conservation."

We also show that the increase in reproductive output is due to an increase in the amount of resources available to the mother rather than an increase in the number of litters produced. This result suggests that the limiting factor in the number of litters produced by placental mammals is the mother’s metabolic power.

This problem can be addressed by the development of new antibacterial agents to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. In this work, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. The results of this study are expected to contribute to the development of new antibiotics. (Show more)"

Popular network architectures often add additional operations and connections to the standard architecture to enable training deeper networks. To achieve accurate results in practice, a large number of trainable parameters are often required. Here, we introduce a network architecture based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice, and automatically adapts to different problems. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data. We also show that the proposed architecture is able to achieve state-of-the-art results for the problem of semantic segmentation of satellite images.

We propose that the BK channel’s closing may represent an early conformational stage of its inactivation. This finding may help to understand the BK channel’s pharmacology and physiology.

The parasite, Plasmodium, invades the human red blood cell (RBC) to complete its life cycle. The invasion process is poorly understood, and the role of the RBC in the process has been largely ignored. Here, we show that the malaria parasite alters the physical properties of the RBC, reducing the energy barrier to invasion. This finding represents a major change in our understanding of the invasion process and suggests that invasion is a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces. This work provides a new perspective on the invasion process and could lead to the development of new strategies for the treatment and control of malaria. (Show more)"

In the temperate regions, seasonal influenza outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in ambient humidity. While low ambient humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our study provides mechanistic insights into the impact of dry air on influenza virus infection and disease outcome. These findings may help to develop strategies to reduce the impact of influenza virus infection in the temperate regions. This article is protected by copyright. All"

Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. We find that the spider’s web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to sense the motion of web threads, which allows the spider to remotely detect and localize the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself. The spider also enables the flexibility to functionally adjust and regularly regenerate its external ""eardrum"" according to its needs.

These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. HM was associated with less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia, but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors.

We use this method to study the physical dynamics of five US cities over the course of 10 y. We find that neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements. Neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities. Our method can be applied to other cities and to other types of data to study the physical dynamics of cities in the future."

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

This shift from net uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates, leading to the functional breakdown of the symbiosis. Our findings provide a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

We demonstrate that the tumorigenesis process leads to the activation of a JNK-dependent feedback loop that triggers a regenerative response in the epithelium, leading to a dysbiosis of the microbiome and a loss of the intestinal barrier. We also show that inhibiting JNK signaling or depleting the microbiome restores barrier function of the epithelium, leading to a reestablishment of host–microbe homeostasis, and organismal lifespan extension. Our work highlights the importance of controlling the activity level of JNK signaling to maintain epithelial barrier function and host–microbe homeostasis.

Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

In this study, we show that the activity of a specific enzyme, alkylglycerol monooxygenase, is a key regulator of ether lipid metabolism in macrophages. We also show that the activity of this enzyme is regulated by tetrahydrobiopterin, a cofactor essential for nitric oxide synthesis. Our results demonstrate that the activity of alkylglycerol monooxygenase is a key regulator of ether lipid metabolism in murine macrophages and reveal that alteration of alkylglycerol monooxygenase activity has a profound impact on the lipidome also beyond the class of ether lipids. Our findings have implications for our understanding of the role of ether lipids in the biology of macrophages and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with ether lipid dysregulation.

Here we propose a new approach to language processing that is based on the ability of neurons to change their properties in response to experience. We show that this mechanism can support memory for the contents of working memory. We demonstrate that this approach can account for a number of experimental observations and that it is sensitive to context and serial order. This work provides a computational neurobiology of language that is based on the ability of neurons to change their properties in response to experience. It is a step toward a more complete understanding of the neural basis of language.

Thus, they have evolved a number of defense mechanisms to protect themselves from pathogens and other environmental stresses. One of the most important defense mechanisms is the production of siRNAs, which are then used to silence the expression of the pathogen or stressor. Here, we show that DNA nanostructures can be used to deliver siRNAs to plants, which can then be used to silence the expression of a target gene. We also show that the size, shape, and location of the siRNA attachment locus on the DNA nanostructure are important for the delivery and silencing of the target gene. Our work establishes the feasibility of delivering biomolecules to plants with DNA nanostructures and both details the design parameters of importance for plant cell internalization and also assesses the impact of DNA nanostructure geometry for gene silencing mechanisms. This work is a significant step forward in the development of DNA nanostructures as a tool for plant biology."

We show that the majority of the nutrients delivered to Lake Michigan by its tributaries are from a small number of large watersheds. However, these large watersheds are not the only drivers of coastal nutrient inputs. Small watersheds are also important, and their nutrient inputs are more biologically available to fuel algal blooms. Our findings highlight the need to address nutrient inputs from all watersheds, large and small, to reduce the ecological impacts of nutrient pollution in lakes and reservoirs."

We show that the event was associated with a doubling of atmospheric CO2 and a biodiversity nadir. We also show that the event was linked to an injection of organic matter–derived carbon and to near 20% of areal extent of seafloor anoxia.

In humans, its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. Investigation of the dynamic regulation of the exocyst-related processes using mutants in genetically tractable organisms such as Arabidopsis thaliana is limited by the lethality or the severity of phenotypes. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 (exocyst component of 70 kDa) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study not only provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation but also offers a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This study highlights the need for a more holistic approach"
