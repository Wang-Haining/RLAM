The evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been enigmatic, and a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we present the first genomic and transcriptomic analyses of two distantly related myxozoan species, Kudoa iwatai and Myxobolus cerebralis, and compare these to the transcriptome and genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results show that the myxozoan body plan is reduced to a minimal structure, and that the genome is one of the smallest reported in animals. These results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the Myxozoa are a sister group to the Cnidaria. (Show more)"

The current pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus has a high mutation rate and is constantly evolving. This study focuses on the role of the accessory protein Orf6 of SARS-CoV-2 in the evasion of the host antiviral response. We show that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and blocks nuclear import of importin/karyopherin, which is essential for the transport of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) to the nucleus. We also show that Orf6 binds to the Nup98-Rae1 complex, which is essential for the docking of the importin/karyopherin complex at the NPC. Our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the host antiviral response. This knowledge could be used to develop new antiviral strategies. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 by binding to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

However, identifying the species-level composition of diets has been challenging, and the extent to which different species partition food resources has been difficult to quantify. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammal species in semiarid African savanna. We found that the species-level identification of diets is possible, and that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This study highlights the importance of using DNA metabarcoding to identify species-level diet composition in future studies of trophic interactions. This article is protected by copyright.

However, the global load of floating plastic debris is still unknown. We show that the global load of floating plastic debris is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This is due to size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

An allosteric coupling underlies C-type inactivation coupled to activation gating in this ion-channel family. We have identified the second Threonine residue within the TTVGYGD signature sequence of K+ channels as a crucial residue for this allosteric communication. We show that this Threonine residue is essential for the structural collapse of the channel’s selectivity filter on activation. This structural change is the basis for the allosteric communication between the activation gate and the selectivity filter.

However, the role of personality traits in the establishment of social hierarchies is poorly understood. Here we show that anxiety, a personality trait, directly influences social dominance in male outbred rats and identify an important mediating role for mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens. High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low-anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as decreased ATP and increased ROS production in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious individuals. We conclude that mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens is crucial for social hierarchy establishment and is critically involved in the low social competitiveness associated with high anxiety.

However, the use of a single material phase and heuristically developed structural patterns leads to restricted design space and potential failure to achieve specific target behaviors. Here, we propose a free-form inverse design approach to synthesize multiple hyperelastic materials with distinct properties into composite structures. The digitally synthesized structures exhibit organic shapes and motions with irregular distributions of material phases. Within the structures, different materials play distinct roles yet seamlessly collaborate through sophisticated deformation mechanisms to produce the target behaviors. The synthesized structures are effectively manufactured via multimaterial fabrication and heteroassembly strategy. The proposed approach can be utilized to design function-oriented and situation-specific mechanical devices for a wide range of applications.

We show that IGF2BP1 can reprogram the hemoglobin expression pattern in human erythroid cells. This is accomplished by reduced expression of the adult hemoglobin genes and increased expression of fetal hemoglobin. This study suggests a mechanism for chronoregulation of hemoglobin expression in humans. This mechanism may be relevant to the timing of development in humans and to the hemoglobin phenotypes observed in human disease.

It is regulated by cellular metabolism, redox homeostasis, and various signaling pathways related to cancer. In this study, we found that activating mutation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) function, highly frequent events in human cancer, confers ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells, and that inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis induction. Mechanistically, this resistance requires sustained activation of mTORC1 and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)C1-dependent induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. Furthermore, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a transcriptional target of SREBP1, mediates the ferroptosis-suppressing activity of SREBP1 by producing monounsaturated fatty acids.

The most common drugs for treating hypertension are L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs). LCCBs are associated with heart failure, but the mechanism is not known. Here, we show that LCCBs activate Ca2+ signaling pathways that promote vascular remodeling. Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. Our findings unravel a mechanism of LCCBs action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. This study provides a rationale for the use of LCCBs in hypertension. It also provides a rationale for the use of LCCBs in hypertension in combination with other drugs that target STIM/ORAI. This study may also provide a rationale for the use of LCCBs in the treatment of heart failure. (Show more)"

However, the NWFP failed to halt the decline of older-forest–associated birds, and the early-seral ecosystem area declined in two ecoregions. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure. The NWFP is a unique opportunity to evaluate the influence of policy."

The best candidate is synthetically more accessible, exhibits higher solubility and binding affinity to the ribosome, and is up to 56 times more active against resistant pathogens than telithromycin. Notably, the best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice, and automatically adapts to different problems. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data.

Thus, although CTLA-4–deficient mice had more severe collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), they were protected against peptide-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE); however, onset of protein-induced EAE was only delayed. This indicates that CTLA-4 deficiency affects both central and peripheral tolerance and Treg cell-mediated suppression.

We used a combination of genomic and fossil data to trace the evolution of beetles and to estimate the timing and rates of beetle diversification. We also traced the evolution of genes enabling symbiont-independent digestion of lignocellulose, the major component of plant cell walls, using 154 genomes or transcriptomes. Phylogenomic analyses of these uniquely comprehensive datasets resolved previously controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. These novel genes triggered adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles, resulting in nearly half of all living beetle species. We propose that beetles diversified in response to the evolution of microbial genes encoding enzymes that digest plant cell walls. This resulted in the evolution of uniquely specialized plant-feeding habits, such as leaf mining and stem and wood boring. Thus, the evolution of beetles appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized"

However, the evolution of brain power, which is a more relevant measure of cognitive capacity, is still poorly understood. We present a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of brain neuron numbers in amniotes, which is the most fundamental unit of brain computation. We show that reptiles have not only small brains relative to body size but also low neuronal densities, resulting in average neuron numbers over 20 times lower than those in birds and mammals of similar body size. This has important implications for studies using relative brain size as a proxy when looking for evolutionary drivers of animal cognition."

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal cells is not well understood. We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor.

The actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin family of proteins is the major regulator of actin filament disassembly. It is therefore critical for cells to understand how to regulate the activity of ADF/cofilin in different situations. Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to study the action of ADF/cofilin in different mechanical situations. We find that ADF/cofilin is more active in situations that favor filament severing, such as local curvature and mechanical tension. We propose a mechanochemical mechanism, which we verify experimentally, that explains how ADF/cofilin can be more active in these situations. This mechanism is critical for cells to understand how to regulate the activity of ADF/cofilin in different situations. (Show more)"

The distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island suggests that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population.

However, the extent of molecular continuity between males and females is largely unknown. Here, we show that the Drosophila sperm proteome undergoes substantial compositional changes after being transferred to the female reproductive tract. We also show that female-derived proteins begin to associate with sperm immediately after mating, and they comprise nearly 20% of the postmating sperm proteome following 4 d of storage in the female reproductive tract. These findings provide a comprehensive characterization of sperm proteome dynamics and expand our understanding of the critical process of sperm–FRT interactions. This work will be useful to the scientific community studying sperm–FRT interactions, sperm maturation, and the evolution of sperm–FRT interactions. (Show more)"

Mutations in VWF cause the common bleeding disorder, von Willebrand disease (VWD). The A1 domain in VWF binds to glycoprotein Ibα (GPIbα) on platelets. We show that force application switches the A1 domain to a second state with faster on-rate, providing a mechanism for activating VWF binding to platelets. Switching occurs near 10 pN, a force that also induces a state of the receptor−ligand complex with slower off-rate. Force greatly increases the effects of VWD mutations, explaining pathophysiology. Conversion of single molecule kon (s−1) to bulk phase kon (s−1M−1) and the kon and koff values extrapolated to zero force for the low-force pathways show remarkably good agreement with bulk-phase measurements. This work provides a mechanism for understanding the pathophysiology of VWD and a mechanism for using force to treat bleeding. (Read more)"

To overcome this conundrum, we introduce the dual-field-of-view (FOV) high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) for simultaneously profiling aerosol and water cloud properties. The observations of aerosols and clouds using this instrument, verified by the Monte Carlo simulation and coincident observations of other techniques, were conducted to investigate the interactions between aerosol loading and water cloud microphysical properties. A case study over Beijing highlights the scientific potential of dual-FOV HSRL to become a significant contributor to the ACI investigations.

Here, we present data on the thermostability of ancestral enzymes that are compatible with the surface environment. The thermostability of these enzymes is shown to correlate with the surface environment, and the results are used to infer the surface temperature of the ancestor of each enzyme.

The K+ channel KCNB1 encodes the BK channel, which is important for the normal function of the heart. The BK channel is unique in that it lacks a classic activation gate and shows no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its rates and extents inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. Our findings may help to understand the BK channel’s unique properties and may provide a basis for the development of new drugs for the treatment of heart failure. (Show more)"

We find that low humidity impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, HM predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. In addition, HM was associated with less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors. The findings highlight the importance of psychological examinations of masculinity as a cultural ideology to understand how men’s and women’s endorsement of HM legitimizes patriarchal dominance and reinforces gender, race, and class-based hierarchies via candidate support.

The color of nectar is an important trait that attracts pollinators. However, the mechanisms that underlie the production of nectar pigments are poorly understood. Here, we show that the red color of the nectar of Nesocodon mauritianus is derived from a previously undescribed alkaloid, nesocodin. We also identify nesocodin in the red nectar of the distantly related and hummingbird-visited Jaltomata herrerae and provide molecular evidence for convergent evolution of this trait. This work identifies a convergently evolved trait in two vertebrate-pollinated species, suggesting that the red pigment is selectively favored and that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation. This work also provides a molecular framework for the study of nectar chemistry. (Show more)"

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions. Our findings are important for understanding the origins and evolution of MERS-CoV and other bat coronaviruses, and for developing strategies to prevent and control their cross-"

We found that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion.

Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods.

We find that changes in human demography tend to suppress global fire activity, keeping more carbon within terrestrial ecosystems and attenuating warming. Our results highlight the importance of active fire management in reducing warming. However, the risk of more extreme fires under climate change means that climate–carbon cycle feedbacks are most effective at slowing global warming under lower emission scenarios. Our study highlights the need for a more integrated approach to climate change mitigation, including active fire management.

However, the mechanisms by which this is achieved are poorly understood. Here, we show that the squid Euprymna scolopes regulates the activities of its luminescent symbionts, Vibrio fischeri, by the strategic delivery of a single glycan, chitin. Chitin is released by the host only at night, when the symbiont population is at its peak, and is catabolized by the symbionts, whose activity is enhanced by the resulting changes in the environment. This study provides a mechanism for how the provision of a single nutrient can regulate the activities of a complex microbial community. It also suggests that other animal hosts may similarly regulate the activities of their associated microbial communities through the strategic provision of specific nutrients.

We illustrate our method with a prominent example of underutilized text: the US National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). The NVDRS summarizes violent death incidents with structured variables and unstructured narratives. We identify 225 latent topics in the narratives (e.g., preparation for death and physical aggression); many of these topics are not captured by existing structured variables. Motivated by known patterns in suicide and homicide by gender and recent research on gender biases in semantic space, we identify the gender bias of our topics (e.g., a topic about pain medication is feminine). We then compare the gender bias of topics to their prevalence in narratives of female versus male victims. Results provide a detailed quantitative picture of reporting about lethal violence and its gendered nature. Our method offers a flexible and broadly applicable approach to model topics in text data. It can be applied to many domains, including social media, news, and medical records. It can also be extended to other types of data, such as images and videos. Our method is a step"

The IL1RAP (IL1R3) is expressed on AML cells, but not on normal hematopoietic stem cells. We show that monoclonal antibodies targeting IL1RAP have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML.

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

The extremely warm and dry conditions have led to acute water shortages, groundwater overdraft, critically low streamflow, and enhanced wildfire risk. We find that precipitation deficits in California were more than twice as likely to yield drought years if they occurred when conditions were warm. We find that although there has not been a substantial change in the probability of either negative or moderately negative precipitation anomalies in recent decades, the occurrence of drought years has been greater in the past two decades than in the preceding century. In addition, the probability that precipitation deficits co-occur with warm conditions and the probability that precipitation deficits produce drought have both increased. We conclude that anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of co-occurring warm–dry conditions like those that have created the acute human and ecosystem impacts associated with the “exceptional” 2012–2014 drought in California."

The etiology of autism is so complicated because it involves the effects of variants of several hundred risk genes along with the contribution of environmental factors. Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. As an alternative approach, extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying the convergence of the targets and functions of the autism-risk genes to facilitate mapping out causal paths. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. Mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a unique example of how a simple behavioral"

We show that aggregates cause non–cell-autonomous pathology, including loss of vulnerable neurons. Finally, we show that the release of aggregates requires N-ethylmalemide–sensitive fusion protein 1, demonstrating that active release and uptake of aggregates are important elements of spreading and disease progression.

Montsechia was an aquatic angiosperm living and reproducing below the surface of the water, similar to Ceratophyllum. Montsechia is Barremian in age, raising questions about the very early divergence of the Ceratophyllum clade compared with its position as sister to eudicots in many cladistic analyses.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas the more rigid uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into"

These findings support the conventional wisdom of election administration experts and contradict many popular claims in the media."

We demonstrate that the catabolism of amino acids during heat stress promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. This process forms a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host.

In turn, the dysbiotic microbiome triggers a regenerative response and stimulates tumor growth. We find that inhibiting JNK signaling or depletion of the microbiome restores barrier function of the intestinal epithelium, leading to a reestablishment of host–microbe homeostasis, and organismic lifespan extension.

Furthermore, we found that treatment of mice bearing breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) with the humanized anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab repressed expression of genes associated with breast cancer stemness, reduced activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or BMI1, and impaired the capacity of breast cancer PDXs to metastasize or reengraft Rag2−/−γc−/− mice. Finally, treatment of PDX-bearing mice with cirmtuzumab and paclitaxel was more effective than treatment with either alone in eradicating breast cancer PDXs.

PD patients showed reduced deactivation of the “DMN-like” dominant metabolic RSN, which was partially corrected by dopaminergic therapy. In contrast, in Alzheimer’s disease, significant reductions in network expression were already present at diagnosis, progressing over time. Metabolic imaging can directly provide useful information regarding the resting organization of the brain in health and disease."

In bacteria, the best studied modification is the 5′ nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) modification of transfer RNAs. In this study, we describe a 5′ NAD+ cap in yeast. This cap is found on subsets of nuclear and mitochondrial encoded mRNAs. We show that the 5′ NAD+ cap is produced cotranscriptionally and is not found on pre-mRNAs. This discovery expands the number of cap structures in eukaryotes and raises the possibility that the 5′ NAD+ cap could modulate RNA stability and translation on specific subclasses of mRNAs.

However, the role of FSIP1 in the progression and drug sensitivity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies.

However, these factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning becomes steeper, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. Our findings have important implications for the design of biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation strategies. (Show more)"

We sought to understand how Fe levels impact the retina, given that retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are also challenged by accumulations of vitamin A aldehyde adducts (bisretinoid lipofuscin) that photogenerate reactive oxygen species and photodecompose into damaging aldehyde- and dicarbonyl-bearing species. We found that Fe levels in the retina are tightly regulated and that Fe-mediated oxidation and degradation of the bisretinoid A2E was required for the photoinduced toxicity of the retina. These findings have implications for the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in the elderly. They also suggest that Fe chelation may be a useful strategy for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration. (Read more)"

However, the evolution of specialization is often considered a dead end due to the constraints associated with the evolution of morphological and functional optimizations throughout the organism. Here we show that siphonophore specialists can evolve into generalists, and that specialists on one prey type have directly evolved into specialists on other prey types. Our findings suggest that shifts between prey types are linked to shifts in the morphology, mode of evolution, and evolutionary correlations of tentilla and their nematocysts. The evolutionary history of siphonophore specialization helps build a broader perspective on predatory niche diversification via morphological innovation and evolution. These findings contribute to understanding how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) is a key metabolic regulator, converting serine to glycine and a folate-bound one-carbon unit. SHMT is up-regulated in cancer, and the mitochondrial isozyme is strongly up-regulated in cancer. Here we show that dual SHMT1/2 knockout blocks colon cancer tumor xenograft formation. We also identify small-molecule dual inhibitors of SHMT1/2, and show that they are effective in cell-based assays. Finally, we show that formate can rescue cells from SHMT inhibition, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of DLBCL. This work provides a metabolic rationale for targeting SHMT in cancer. It also provides a metabolic rationale for targeting glycine import in cancer. It also provides a metabolic rationale for targeting formate metabolism in cancer. It also provides a metabolic rationale for targeting DLBCL. It also provides a metabolic rationale for targeting the glycine import pathway in cancer. It also provides a metabolic rationale for"

However, little is known about the role of natural landscapes such as forests in meeting nutrition goals. This study shows that deforestation can reduce people’s diets and vitamin A adequacy, and that forest fragmentation can increase people’s diets and vitamin A adequacy. The results have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. This study also provides a framework for future research on the role of natural landscapes in meeting nutrition goals. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

This has led to the propagation of subsoil compaction into deeper soil layers, which now exceeds safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map of subsoil compaction susceptibility, based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the recent discovery of a 100-m-long, 10-m-wide, and 3-m-deep, 150-million-year-old, fossilized footprint in the Morrison Formation of Colorado."
