In this work, we report the structure of the hydrate phase at high pressure. We also demonstrate that the hydrate phase is stable at high pressure and high temperature. This work provides a fundamental understanding of the structure of the hydrate phase and its stability at high pressure and temperature.

Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we present the first comparative analysis of the genomes of two myxozoans and a cnidarian, and show that myxozoans are a sister taxon to the less reduced cnidarian parasite, P. hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insight into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This mechanism may be of great importance for the development of therapeutic strategies to combat COVID-19. (Show more)"

We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

The architecture is based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data. The proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters, and is easier to train and apply in practice."

We present a continuous, first-of-its-kind 1.3-My record of continental hydroclimate and lake-level variability derived from drill core data from Lake Malawi, East Africa (9–15° S). Over the Quaternary, we observe dramatic shifts in effective moisture, resulting in large-scale changes in one of the world’s largest lakes and most diverse freshwater ecosystems. Results show evidence for 24 lake level drops of more than 200 m during the Late Quaternary, including 15 lowstands when water levels were more than 400 m lower than modern. A dramatic shift is observed at the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT), consistent with far-field climate forcing, which separates vastly different hydroclimate regimes before and after ∼800,000 years ago. Before 800 ka, lake levels were lower, indicating a climate drier than today, and water levels changed frequently. Following the MPT high-amplitude lake level variations dominate the"

We demonstrate the utility of this approach by optimizing the binding of an antibody that is effective against the Delta variant. Our optimized antibody is more than 10-fold more potent against the Delta variant than the original antibody. This approach can be used to optimize the binding of other antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 variants and potentially be used to develop new antibody drug candidates for the treatment of COVID-19.

For example, diamond is not a metal, and its electronic properties are not fully understood. Here, we show that diamond can be metallized reversibly by applying strain. We also show that diamond can be demetallized by applying pressure. These findings offer opportunities for tailoring properties of diamond via strain engineering for electronic, photonic, and quantum applications."

The seasonal increase in influenza virus transmission is associated with decreases in ambient humidity. However, the impact of humidity on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that mice housed in low humidity are more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the impact of ambient humidity on influenza virus transmission and disease outcome. They also suggest that low humidity may be a modifiable risk factor for influenza infection. This may have implications for the development of strategies to control seasonal influenza epidemics.

This merge operation is consistent with a bottom-up parser that applies equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity. Our results provide initial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases. This model of language processing may be a key to understanding the brain’s efficient representation of the structure of language. (Show more)"

Here, we introduce a deep learning approach that can be used to optimize the binding of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by optimizing the binding of an antibody that is effective against the Delta variant. Our optimized antibody is more than 10-fold more potent against the Delta variant than the original antibody. Our approach can be used to optimize the binding of other antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 variants and potentially be used to develop new antibody drug candidates for the treatment of COVID-19.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

Here, we show that remdesivir, an antiviral drug that is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of Ebola virus disease, is effective in preventing and treating MERS-CoV infection in a nonhuman primate model. This suggests that remdesivir may be a useful treatment for MERS, and may also be considered for a wider range of coronaviruses, including the currently emerging novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV.

This glycan is catabolized by the symbionts only at night, when the squid is producing light, and is required for the maintenance of a healthy symbiosis. This study provides a mechanistic link between the provision of nutrients and the regulation of the activities of the microbiota in a host.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas the more rigid uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into"

Here, we show that the metabolic state of the coral host is a key factor in the onset of the breakdown of the symbiosis. We demonstrate that the catabolism of amino acids is a major driver of the metabolic energy demand of the coral host, which is compensated by the degradation of the coral’s own organic compounds. The resulting shift from net uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host.

We found that the expression of the orphan receptor ROR1 was up-regulated in breast cancer cells following treatment with chemotherapy. ROR1 expression was associated with the activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or BMI1, which are involved in the regulation of breast cancer stemness. ROR1 expression also enhanced the capacity of breast cancer cells to metastasize or reengraft mice. Treatment of mice bearing breast cancer patient-derived xenografts with the humanized anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab repressed expression of genes associated with breast cancer stemness, reduced activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or BMI1, and impaired the capacity of breast cancer PDXs to metastasize or reengraft mice. These results indicate that targeting ROR1 may improve the response to chemotherapy of patients with breast cancer. (truncated)"

The SAN is also known as the “clock of the heart” because it is the only cardiac region that generates electrical activity in a rhythmic manner. Here, we report that stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and Orai1 channels, key components of store-operated Ca2+ entry, are selectively expressed in the specialized cardiomyocytes of the SAN. Cardiac-specific deletion of STIM1 in mice resulted in depletion of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ stores of the SAN and led to SAN dysfunction, as was evident by a reduction in heart rate, sinus arrest, and an exaggerated autonomic response to cholinergic signaling. These studies reveal that STIM1 is a multifunctional regulator of Ca2+ dynamics in the SAN that links SR Ca2+ store content with electrical events occurring in the plasma membrane, thereby contributing to automaticity of the SAN.

This work may help to identify patients who are at risk of developing paroxysmal EEG abnormalities and may also lead to the development of new therapies. This article is protected by copyright.

The cause of this warming is still debated, but it is likely due to a combination of natural and anthropogenic forcings. Here, we present evidence for a similar warming event that occurred ∼304 Ma, which was likely caused by a natural forcing. This event is important to understand because it occurred during a glacial period, when the Earth system was already in a state of reduced greenhouse warming."

Certification is the tool most used to fulfill these procurement policies, and around 20% of global palm oil production is certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). However, the effect of certification on deforestation in oil palm plantations remains unclear. We show that certification is associated with reduced deforestation in Indonesia, the leading producer of palm oil. Certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation."

The exocyst complex is composed of 10 evolutionarily conserved subunits. The function of the exocyst complex is conserved from bacteria to humans, and its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

In this study, we investigate the effects of multiple sex determination alleles on the evolution of secondary sexual characteristics in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii. We find that the interaction of multiple sex determination alleles can produce a modular system of sexual polymorphism, where the same trait can be sexually dimorphic in some individuals and monomorphic in others. This system of sexual polymorphism may be a general feature of sex determination, and may be important for understanding the maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations."

We show that the levels of iron in the retina impact the balance between these two sets of species."

Our findings have implications for understanding the evolution of predatory feeding strategies, and for predicting the effects of climate change on marine food webs."

Here we report the discovery of a small-molecule dual inhibitor of serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1/2 (SHMT1/2). This inhibitor is effective in vitro and in vivo, and is particularly effective in B-cell cancer cell lines. We show that the inhibitor is effective in vivo because it is effective in vitro, and that the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity is enhanced by a deficiency in glycine import. Thus, the inhibitor is a promising lead for the development of cancer therapeutics. This work is a step toward the development of metabolic cancer therapeutics.

We show that the increase in mechanization has led to a significant increase in subsoil compaction, which now exceeds safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We also show that the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods. This suggests that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. Our findings have important implications for the future of agriculture, as well as for the study of the past. (Show more)"
