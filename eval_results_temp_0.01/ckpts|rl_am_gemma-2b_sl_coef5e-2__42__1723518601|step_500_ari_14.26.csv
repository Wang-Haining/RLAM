The most promising approach is to use the language of category theory, which has been successfully applied to other foundational problems in mathematics. However, the mathematical structure of quantum theory is so far-reaching that it is not clear how to formulate the axioms of quantum theory in this language. In this paper, we show that the axioms of quantum theory can be formulated purely categorically, without presupposing any analytical structure. This provides a mathematical foundation for quantum theory that is both general and precise."

Although the evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species and a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results show that the myxozoan body plan was reduced to a minimal level, with a small genome and a lack of key signaling pathways and transcriptional factors important for multicellular development. These results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by a reduction in genome size and gene content. This process may have been a prerequisite for the evolution of parasitism. (Less)"

The SARS-CoV-2 virus is able to evade the host innate immune response by blocking the nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, which are key factors for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes. Here, we show that the viral accessory protein Orf6 is responsible for this evasion mechanism. We demonstrate that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and interacts with Nup98-Rae1. This interaction is required for the ability of Orf6 to block nuclear import of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and to impair the IFN antagonistic function of Orf6. Our results unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the host antiviral response and could lead to the development of new antiviral strategies.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa in herbivore feces. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species (six wild, one domestic) in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results highlight the importance of diet composition in understanding the role of LMH in African savanna ecosystems. They also provide a proof-of-concept for the use of DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet composition in herbivore feces.

We show that the global load of plastic debris on the open ocean surface is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This discrepancy is explained by the selective removal of plastic debris by nano-fragmentation and transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes. This study provides a global view of the fate of plastic debris in the ocean and highlights the importance of size-selective sinks in the open ocean.

These results suggest a mechanism for chronoregulation of fetal and adult hemoglobin expression in humans. This knowledge may be useful for the development of therapeutic strategies for hemoglobinopathies. It may also be useful for the development of therapeutic strategies for hemoglobinopathies."

In this study, we found that activating mutation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) function, highly frequent events in human cancer, confers ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells, and that inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis induction. This resistance requires sustained activation of mTORC1 and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)C1-dependent induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. Furthermore, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a transcriptional target of SREBP1, mediates the ferroptosis-suppressing activity of SREBP1 by producing monounsaturated fatty acids.

The NWFP’s goal of reversing the decline of older forests has not been achieved, and the creation of early-seral ecosystems may impede the development of older-forest structure.

Phylogenomic analyses of these uniquely comprehensive datasets resolved controversial beetle relationships and dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous. We propose that the acquisition of genes encoding enzymes that enable efficient digestion of plant cell walls, including lignocellulose, triggered the Mesozoic diversification of specialized herbivorous beetles. This resulted in the nearly half of all living beetles being specialized herbivores. Thus, the evolution of beetles appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding enzymes that enable efficient digestion of plant cell walls. This study provides insights into the evolution of the most speciose group of animals. (Less Less)"

We have shown that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1 may act as a tumor suppressor in some settings. These data suggest that TRAP1 may be a promising target for cancer therapy."

It is known to sever filaments, but the mechanism by which it does so is not understood. Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to monitor and quantify the action of ADF in different mechanical situations. We find that ADF binds to filaments and induces severing in a mechanical torque-dependent manner. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for how ADF’s ability to sever actin filaments is enhanced in the context of cell biology. They also provide a general framework for understanding how mechanical forces can enhance the activity of other molecular motors and enzymes. This framework may be useful in understanding other biological processes. Finally, our results have implications for understanding the role of ADF in various diseases.

We demonstrate that these neuron-derived cytokines correlate with the extent of microglial activation and mobilization, even in the absence of extracellular plaques and cell death. Thus, we identify the Aβ-burdened neuron as a primary proinflammatory agent, implicating the intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ as a significant immunological component in the AD pathogenesis.

However, the ACI is difficult to be well represented in current climate models. This is due to the complexity of the ACI process and the lack of observational capability. To overcome this conundrum, we introduce the dual-field-of-view (FOV) high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) for simultaneously profiling aerosol and water cloud properties, especially water cloud microphysical properties. This instrument, verified by the Monte Carlo simulation and coincident observations of other techniques, was used to conduct a case study over Beijing. The observations show that increased aerosol loading led to increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius—consistent with expectations—but had no discernible increase on liquid water path. This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations obtained from the dual-FOV HSRL constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI process. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI."

Ion channels normally have two types of pore gates, one for fast activation/deactivation and the other for slow inactivation/recovery. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that BK channels have a slow C-type inactivation gate that is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability.

The parasite erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 (EBA175) is required for parasite invasion in most parasite strains, but its function is unknown. Here, we show that EBA175 binding to glycophorin A (GPA) on the RBC surface leads to an increase in the cytoskeletal tension of the red cell and a reduction in the bending modulus of the cell’s membrane. We isolate the changes in the cytoskeleton and membrane and show that reduction in the bending modulus is directly correlated with parasite invasion efficiency. These data suggest that the malaria parasite primes the erythrocyte surface through its binding antigens, altering the biophysical nature of the target cell and thus reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion. This finding would constitute a major change in our concept of malaria parasite invasion, suggesting it is, in fact, a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces working together to facilitate entry.

Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

This pattern of activity is consistent with a bottom-up parser that merges words into phrases, and it provides initial evidence for the reality of this parser in the brain.

We present a large dataset of ancient Yersinia pestis genomes from Eurasia, which allowed us to explore the diversity of this pathogen during the formative years of its emergence. Our results reveal a nonflea-adapted and potentially extinct lineage that persisted over millennia without significant parallel diversification, accompanied by rapid dispersal across continents. We also discover the presence of the flea-adapted form of plague in Bronze Age Iberia, previously only identified in the Caucasus and the Volga regions, suggesting a much wider geographic spread of this form of plague. Together, these data reveal the dynamic nature of plague’s formative years in terms of its early evolution and ecology.

This ability is known as chromatophoresis. In this study, we show that the occurrence of blue-green chromatophoresis has evolved multiple times during vertebrate evolution. We also describe a new mechanism for chromatophoresis, which relies on a group of proteins that bind biliverdin, a pigment that is normally present in the blood. This discovery provides a molecular and functional explanation for the evolution of blue-green chromatophoresis and introduces a new function for a member of the serpin superfamily. Our results also provide a molecular explanation for the evolution of green coloration in anurans, which is a widespread group of amphibians that is able to change its color in response to environmental cues.

In this study, we show that hypoxia induces expression of the m6A demethylase AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), which increases the expression of the pluripotency factor NANOG and the breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) phenotype. ALKBH5 expression is induced by hypoxia through the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and HIF-2α pathways. ALKBH5 overexpression increases NANOG levels and the percentage of BCSCs, whereas knockdown of ALKBH5 decreases the percentage of BCSCs. Thus, ALKBH5 expression in hypoxic tumors may contribute to the maintenance of BCSCs and the progression of breast cancer. This study provides insight into the role of m6A modification in the maintenance of the BCSC phenotype. This information may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for breast cancer.

The source of the parchment, often called “uterine vellum,” has been a long-standing controversy in codicology. The Latin term abortivum in many sources has led some scholars to suggest that fetal calves or sheep skins were used. Others have argued that it would not be possible to sustain herds if so many pocket Bibles were made from fetal skins, arguing instead for unexpected alternatives, such as rabbit. Here, we report a simple and objective method to identify the animal origin of parchment. The noninvasive method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals. These results suggest that ultrafine vellum does not necessarily derive from the use of abortive or newborn animals with ultrathin hides, but could equally well reflect a production process that allowed the"

The pathogenesis of IBD is complex and multifactorial, and the current treatment is limited. In this study, we found that retinoic acid-related orphan receptor α (RORα) is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis by attenuating nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcriptional activity. RORα deletion in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) leads to excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis reveals that RORα/histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3)-mediated attenuation of NF-κB signaling controls the balance of inflammatory responses. Therapeutic strategies targeting this epigenetic regulation could be beneficial to the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, including IBD.

This glycan is catabolized by the symbionts, which is required for the maintenance of a healthy symbiosis. This glycan-mediated control of symbiont numbers may be a general strategy used by animals to regulate the activities of their associated microbes.

We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML.

We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR).

Our analysis reveals no significant differences in the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration between control and warmed plots in all biomes, with the exception of deserts and boreal forests. Thus, our data provide limited evidence of acclimation of soil respiration to experimental warming in several major biome types, contrary to the results from multiple single-site studies. Our analysis adds a unique cross-biome perspective on the temperature response of soil respiration, information critical to improving our mechanistic understanding of how soil carbon dynamics change with climatic warming.

We use a high-resolution climate model to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the probability of occurrence of multiyear rainfall deficits in southwestern South Africa. We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% by the year 2100 under an intermediate-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5 [SSP2-4.5]) and to 80% under a high-emission scenario (SSP5-8.5). These results highlight the strong sensitivity of the drought risk in SSA to future anthropogenic emissions. They also highlight the importance of regional downscaling of climate models for risk assessment. This approach can be applied to other regions and countries.

We found that ASK1 deficiency in microglia/macrophages and astrocytes ameliorated EAE severity, whereas ASK1 deficiency in T cells and dendritic cells had no significant effects on EAE severity. ASK1 signaling in microglia/macrophages played a major role in generating and maintaining disease. Activated astrocytes produce key inflammatory mediators, including CCL2, which further activated and recruited microglia/macrophages. Astrocyte-specific analysis revealed CCL2 expression was higher in the later stage compared with the early stage, suggesting a greater proinflammatory role of astrocytes in the later stage.

The genetic etiology of autism is so complicated because it involves the effects of variants of several hundred risk genes along with the contribution of environmental factors. Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. As an alternative approach, extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying the convergence of the targets and functions of the autism-risk genes to facilitate mapping out causal paths. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. Mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of autism and opens up a new"

Here, we identified and characterized an immunosuppressant protein (MTX) that is highly concentrated in the submandibular salivary gland of the bat, Myotis pilosus. MTX selectively inhibits the epoxide hydrolase function of leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) to inhibit LTA4 hydrolysis and the generation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a potent lipid chemoattractant for host defense against infection. MTX potently inhibited proinflammatory proteases (i.e., plasmin, trypsin, and elastase) to induce immune tolerance and maintain high stability.

Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions in ALS are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. Rather, the inclusions contain proteins that are supersaturated even more than the native interaction partners. This suggests that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the formation of inclusions in ALS and suggest that the inclusion bodies are a result of a metastable state of the proteins. This metastable state is likely a consequence of the disease-related progressive loss of protein homeostasis in motor neurons.

Here, we show that the squid Euprymna scolopes regulates the provision of a single glycan to its symbiotic luminescent bacteria, Vibrio fischeri, in a diel rhythm. This glycan is catabolized by the symbionts, which is required for the maintenance of a healthy symbiosis. This glycan-provisioning rhythm is established only in the mature symbiosis, suggesting that it is a critical factor in the establishment of a healthy symbiosis. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of how animals can regulate the activities of their symbionts. It also suggests that other animals may use this same strategy to regulate the activities of their symbionts. This may be important for understanding the evolution of symbiosis and the maintenance of health in animal–microbe associations. (Less Less)"

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced mutagenesis remain largely unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We found that the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop).

To better understand how MERS-CoV infects human cells, we engineered viruses with mutations that blocked sequential proteolysis of the virus spike (S) glycoproteins. These mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses trafficked past cell-surface proteases and into endosomes, whereas precleaved viruses used endosomal fusion-activating proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry. Uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may"

This leads to an up-regulation of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) expression, which contributes to the development of cerebral edema.

The underlying causes of bleaching are still poorly understood, and the consequences of bleaching on coral reefs are expected to become more severe in the future due to climate change. Here, we show that altered nutrient cycling is a key factor in the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis, and that this process is a major driver of the functional breakdown of the coral holobiont. Our results provide a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

In the absence of tumor growth, the epithelium is maintained in a healthy state by a delicate balance between immune surveillance and microbial colonization. However, in the presence of tumors, the epithelium becomes dysfunctional, leading to a dysbiotic microbiome and a loss of host–microbe homeostasis. Our work identifies a JNK-dependent feedback amplification loop between intestinal tumors and the microbiome, which triggers a regenerative response and promotes tumor growth. Our findings highlight the importance of controlling the activity level of JNK signaling to maintain epithelial barrier function and host–microbe homeostasis. They also provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of JNK in cancer and cancer therapy. Our study provides a framework for understanding the crosstalk between tumors and the microbiome in cancer and cancer therapy.

Chemotherapy is the most common treatment for breast cancer, but resistance to chemotherapy is a major problem. In this study, we found that the type I tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor ROR1 was expressed in breast cancer cells following treatment with chemotherapy. ROR1 expression was associated with the expression of genes induced by the activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or B lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region 1 homolog (BMI1). ROR1 expression also enhanced the capacity of breast cancer cells to invade Matrigel, form spheroids, engraft in Rag2−/−γc−/− mice, or survive treatment with paclitaxel. These results indicate that targeting ROR1 may improve the response to chemotherapy of patients with breast cancer.

We derive a gridded map of global riverine fisheries and use it to assess the implications of fishing for biodiversity conservation, fishery sustainability, and food security. We find that freshwater fisheries provide the equivalent of all dietary animal protein for 158 million people, and that poor and undernourished populations are particularly reliant on inland fisheries compared with marine or aquaculture sources. The spatial coincidence of productive fisheries and low food security highlights the critical role of rivers in providing locally sourced, low-cost protein. At the same time, intensive fishing in regions where rivers are already degraded by other stressors may undermine efforts to conserve biodiversity. This syndrome of poverty, nutritional deficiency, fishery dependence, and extrinsic threats to biodiverse river ecosystems underscores the high stakes for improving fishery management. Our enhanced spatial data on estimated catches can facilitate the inclusion of inland fisheries in environmental planning to protect both food security and species diversity. (Less)"

We found that the dominant RSN in healthy subjects was topographically similar to the default mode network. In contrast, in Parkinson’s disease (PD), this RSN was subordinated to an independent disease-related pattern. Network functionality was assessed by quantifying metabolic RSN expression in cerebral blood flow PET scans acquired at rest and during task performance. We observed that the dominant RSN was deactivated during task performance, and that this abnormality was partially corrected by dopaminergic therapy. In Alzheimer’s disease, significant reductions in network expression were already present at diagnosis, progressing over time.

Fibrous sheath interacting protein 1 (FSIP1) is a cancer antigen expressed in the majority of TNBCs and is associated with poor prognosis. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. This article is protected by copyright.

For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners.

Here, we show that Si pretreatment of rice plants increases resistance against the rice leaffolder, a major insect pest of rice, and that this effect is mediated by priming of jasmonate (JA)-mediated defense responses. Our results suggest that Si may be used as a biocontrol agent to protect rice from insect attack. This study also provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between Si and JA in plant defense. (PsycINFO Database Record"

We demonstrate that the size, shape, compactness, stiffness, and attachment location of the DNA nanostructures are important design parameters for the successful delivery of biomolecules across the cell wall of plants. Our work establishes the feasibility of delivering biomolecules to plants with DNA nanostructures and also details the design parameters of importance for plant cell internalization and also assesses the impact of DNA nanostructure geometry for gene silencing mechanisms.

This behavior is reminiscent of the “fine-tuning problem” in cosmology, where the rare combinations of initial conditions that led to the observed universe are biased toward states that extremize the probability of the observed state.

We validate a dynamic causal model of NMDAR-Ab effects on cortical microcircuitry and use this model to identify the key synaptic parameters that best explain EEG paroxysms in pediatric patients with NMDAR-Ab encephalitis. Finally, we show that NMDAR-Ab–related changes render microcircuitry critically susceptible to overt EEG paroxysms when these key parameters are changed, even though the same parameter fluctuations are tolerated in the in silico model of the control condition. These findings offer mechanistic insights into circuit-level dysfunction induced by NMDAR-Ab. They also provide a framework for understanding the mechanisms of other autoimmune encephalitis.

Our results suggest that certification is a promising tool for reducing tropical deforestation, but that it is not a panacea. Rather, it is a tool that must be used in conjunction with other policies and measures. We hope that our results will help to inform the development of future policies to reduce tropical deforestation."

In many vertebrates, sex is determined by a single locus, resulting in two sexes. In species with multiple sex determination alleles, however, sex determination can be polygenic, with multiple alleles determining sex at a single locus. Here we investigate the effects of polygenic sex determination in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii, where two alleles, one of which determines female sex, interact to produce four possible sexes. We find that polygenic sex determination produces modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics, and that the introgression of a newly acquired sex determination allele creates additional axes of variation for sexual traits. These results provide context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of maintaining, gaining, or losing sex determination alleles in populations."

Conversely, forest fragmentation can increase access to fruits and vegetables, which can improve people’s dietary quality. These findings have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals.

However, this increase in capacity has come at a cost of higher vehicle weights, which have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We show that subsoil compaction has become a global problem, affecting 20% of arable land, and that this risk has increased over the course of modern mechanization. This alarming trend calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the discovery of a new species of sauropod in Patagonia, Argentina, that was found to have a fixed foraging trail. This discovery also provides evidence for the existence of a new species of titanosaur in the same locality. Our results suggest that"
