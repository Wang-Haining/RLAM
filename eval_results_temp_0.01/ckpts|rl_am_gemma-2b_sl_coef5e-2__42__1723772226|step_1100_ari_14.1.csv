The hydrate phase is also a potential storage medium for natural gas and carbon dioxide. However, the hydrate phase is unstable at high pressures and temperatures, and it is difficult to study the hydrate phase under high-pressure conditions. In this work, we synthesized a hydrate of neon hydrate and studied its structure by neutron diffraction. The results show that neon atoms can be enclathrated in water molecules to form ice II-structured hydrates. This work provides a new method for studying the hydrate phase under high-pressure conditions. It also provides a new method for studying the structure of the hydrate phase."

In this study, we show that the SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein Orf6 is able to block nuclear import of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and thereby impair the antiviral transcriptional response. We found that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and interacts with the Nup98-Rae1 complex, which is involved in nuclear import of ISGs. We show that the interaction between Orf6 and the Nup98-Rae1 complex is essential for the ability of Orf6 to block nuclear import of ISGs and to impair the IFN response. Our findings provide a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This mechanism may be used by other viruses to interfere with the host antiviral response. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammals in semiarid African savanna. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers, and dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, dietary composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammal assemblages, and that large mammal diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This study highlights the importance of diet in understanding the ecology and evolution of large mammals. (Less)"

However, the global load of plastic on the open ocean surface is still unknown. We show that the global load of plastic on the open ocean surface is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This discrepancy is explained by the selective removal of plastic debris by a combination of processes, including nano-fragmentation, transference to the ocean interior, and sinking. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered.

A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals.

In this study, we identified a mechanism of resistance to ferroptosis, a form of regulated necrosis driven by iron-dependent peroxidation of phospholipids, in cancer cells. This resistance is mediated by activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis, which, in turn, activates sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. We show that SREBP1-mediated lipogenesis protects cancer cells from ferroptosis, and that combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction shows therapeutic promise in preclinical models. These findings provide a rationale for the development of combination therapies for cancer that target the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and ferroptosis. (Show more)"

This has important implications for studies using relative brain size as a proxy when looking for evolutionary drivers of animal cognition."

We find a common Bantu and Austronesian descent for all Malagasy individuals with a limited paternal contribution from Europe and the Middle East. Admixture and demographic growth happened recently, suggesting a rapid settlement of Madagascar during the last millennium. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, there are geographic influences on the present genomic diversity, independent of the admixture, showing that a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations.

We show that the evolution of an aquatic lifestyle is driving three of the four extant aquatic mammal clades toward a size attractor at ∼500 kg. The existence of this body size attractor and the relatively rapid selection toward, and limited deviation from, this attractor rule out most hypothesized drivers of size increase. These three independent body size increases and a shared aquatic optimum size are consistent with control by differences in the scaling of energetic intake and cost functions with body size between the terrestrial and aquatic realms. Under this energetic model, thermoregulatory costs constrain minimum size, whereas limitations on feeding efficiency constrain maximum size. Rather than being released from size pressures, water-dwelling mammals are driven and confined to larger body sizes by the strict energetic demands of the aquatic medium."

In this study, we show that the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses the mechanical activity of its pili to sense surfaces and to regulate its virulence. This is a unique mechanism that has not been described in bacteria. We propose a mechanochemical model where the mechanical activity of pili is sensed by a chemosensory system, and the signal is amplified by a positive feedback loop that promotes long-term surface attachment. This mechanism is important for the pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa, as it allows the bacterium to increase its virulence and biofilm formation in response to the mechanical activity of its pili. This study provides a new perspective on the role of pili in bacterial motility and virulence. It also demonstrates that bacteria can use pili as a sensor to regulate their own gene expression. This is a significant finding that has implications for understanding the evolution of bacterial sensing systems and the regulation of bacterial virulence. (Show more)"

The results provide insights into the structural and functional features of this class of peptides, which may be useful in the development of new classes of antimicrobial agents. This work also illustrates the potential of the model legume Medicago truncatula as a tool for the study of the molecular mechanisms of action of antimicrobial peptides."

However, it is difficult to be well represented in current climate models. This is due to the complexity of the ACI process and the lack of observational capability. Here, we introduce a new technique, the dual-field-of-view high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL), to investigate the ACI process. The HSRL can simultaneously measure aerosol and cloud properties, especially water cloud microphysical properties. We conducted continuous observations of aerosols and clouds using this instrument, verified by the Monte Carlo simulation and coincident observations of other techniques, to investigate the interactions between aerosol loading and water cloud microphysical properties. The observed water cloud profiles identify that due to air entrainment its vertical structure is not perfectly adiabatic, as assumed by many current retrieval methods. Our ACI analysis shows increased aerosol loading led to increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius—consistent with expectations—but had no discernible increase on liquid water path. This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations obtained from the HSRL constitute substantial and significant"

The parasite uses a variety of mechanisms to facilitate invasion, including the binding of its erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 (EBA175) to glycophorin A (GPA) on the RBC surface. Here, we show that EBA175 binding to GPA leads to an increase in the cytoskeletal tension of the red cell and a reduction in the bending modulus of the cell’s membrane. We isolate the changes in the cytoskeleton and membrane and show that reduction in the bending modulus is directly correlated with parasite invasion efficiency. These data suggest that the malaria parasite primes the erythrocyte surface through its binding antigens, altering the biophysical nature of the target cell and thus reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion. This finding would constitute a major change in our concept of malaria parasite invasion, suggesting it is, in fact, a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces working together to facilitate entry.

This suggests that the brain applies a merge operation to words, which is similar to the merge operation that applies to phrases in a tree. Our results provide initial evidence for a neural implementation of a bottom-up or left-corner parser of the incoming language stream.

The auditory organs of these animals are extremely diverse in anatomy after hundreds of millions of years of evolution, yet they are all made up of cellular tissue and are morphologically part of the body. Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. We find that the spider’s web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to sense the motion of web threads, which is better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself. The outsourcing and supersizing of auditory function in spiders provides unique features for studying extended and regenerative sensing and designing novel acoustic flow detectors for precise fluid dynamic measurement and manipulation.

The color of nectar is an important cue for animals to find and consume it. In this study, we show that the red color of the nectar of Nesocodon mauritianus is derived from a previously undescribed alkaloid, nesocodin. We also identify a convergent evolution of red nectar in two other plant species, Jaltomata herrerae and Nesocodon, and provide evidence that the red color is a selective advantage for pollinators. Our findings suggest that the red color of nectar is a common and widespread trait in nectar-feeding animals, and that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation. This work provides a molecular framework for understanding the evolution of nectar color. (Show more)"

In addition, we found that many alleles associated with positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago. These findings provide insights into the demographic processes that occurred during the Early Middle Ages and suggest that the genetic history of Europe during this period was more complex than previously thought."

To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions. Our findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and the origin of bat coronaviruses.

The stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is critical to the fidelity of lagging strand replication, but the nature of this stability is unknown. We developed a unique kinetic assay to measure the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. The results indicate that the pol δ holoenzyme is loosely associated with the PCNA sliding clamp while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This study provides a unique perspective on the nature of the pol δ holoenzyme and its role in DNA replication.

This polymerase can synthesize a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and, in low yield, even tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins. This work represents a major step toward the in vitro evolution of a functional RNA polymerase and the reconstruction of RNA-based life."

Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility, which resulted from the inability to forget or rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

Mutations in the CRAC channel pore-forming protein ORAI1 or the Ca2+ sensing protein STIM1 result in severe immune dysfunction and myopathy. Here, we identify gain-of-function mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of STIM1, which cause Stormorken syndrome, and in ORAI1, which causes a Stormorken-like syndrome. These mutations result in constitutive activation of the CRAC channel, and spontaneous bleeding accompanied by reduced numbers of thrombocytes in zebrafish embryos, recapitulating key aspects of Stormorken syndrome. Our findings expand our understanding of the phenotypic spectrum of dysregulated CRAC channel signaling, advance our knowledge of the molecular function of the CRAC channel, and suggest new therapies aiming at attenuating store-operated Ca2+ entry in the treatment of patients with Stormorken syndrome and related pathologic conditions.

These proteins form intracellular inclusion bodies that are characteristic of different neuropathological subtypes of the disease. The presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in the brain and spinal cord suggests that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

An optical conveyor technique is presented for continuously loading atoms into the desired trapping positions with optimal coupling to the photonic crystal. The device configuration also enables application of optical tweezers for controlled placement of atoms. Devices can be fabricated reliably from a 200-nm silicon nitride device layer using a lithography-based process, producing predicted optical properties in transmission and reflection measurements.

The methods are illustrated with an analysis of the relationship between the size of the brain and the size of the heart in a large dataset of animals. The methods can be applied to any dataset and any statistical learning method. They can be used to find associations that were previously unknown. They can be used to find associations that are not there."

In this study, we identified ets variant 2 (ETV2) as a transcription factor that induces the development of ECs from nonvascular cells. ETV2 is expressed in the skin and is involved in the development of the skin and blood vessels. In this study, we demonstrated that ETV2 induces the development of ECs from fibroblasts in vitro and in vivo. Our study provides a new strategy for the generation of ECs and the development of vascular networks. This strategy can be applied to the treatment of vascular disorders and the regeneration of organs. ETV2 may be a useful target for the treatment of vascular disorders.

We also show that the augmentor ligands are essential for iridophore differentiation in the eye and the body. These experiments establish a physiological link between augmentor ligands and Ltk and demonstrate that particular augmentors activate Ltk in a tissue-specific context to induce iridophore differentiation from neural crest-derived cells and pigment progenitor cells.

Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus. This interaction is required for the selective packaging of the interacting viral RNA segments. We propose that this interaction promotes the formation of a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions, which favors the packaging of the interacting viral RNA segments.

Our results demonstrate a critical role of the activation of YAP/TAZ by disturbed flow in promoting atheroprone phenotypes and atherosclerotic lesion development. Therefore, inhibition of YAP/TAZ activation is a promising athero-protective therapeutic strategy.

We show that humans have vastly expanded the spatial and seasonal “fire niche” in the United States, accounting for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. Human-caused wildfires disproportionately occurred where fuel moisture was higher than lightning-started fires, thereby helping expand the geographic and seasonal niche of wildfire.

The breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis is accompanied by a loss of the coral’s color, which is caused by the expulsion of the algal symbionts. We show that the metabolic activity of the coral host is increased during heat stress, which is compensated by the degradation of amino acids. The resulting shift from net uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont subsequently promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host.

Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity.

The cause of the disease is unknown, but it is thought to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The disease is associated with a loss of dopamine-producing cells, which leads to a reduction in the amount of dopamine in the brain. This, in turn, leads to a reduction in the amount of dopamine that is released by dopamine-producing cells in response to stimuli. This reduction in dopamine release is thought to be the cause of the motor symptoms of the disease. We show that the dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra are connected to the striatum, a brain region involved in the control of movement, by a system of fibers that originate in striosomes, the specialized nuclei of striated cells in the striatum.

Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

This study shows that deforestation can reduce people’s consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are important sources of vitamin A, and thus their vitamin A adequacy. Conversely, forest fragmentation can increase people’s consumption of fruits and vegetables, which is associated with higher vitamin A adequacy. These findings have important implications for policy makers, who should consider the role of natural landscapes in improving people’s diets, particularly in rural areas. The results also highlight the importance of considering the effects of deforestation and fragmentation on people’s diets in future studies. This is important given that the global population is expected to increase by 2.5 billion people by 2050, and that the majority of this growth will occur in rural areas."

We show that the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods. This raises the question of whether the roaming of these giants on the land, and the compaction of the soil they left behind, had similar effects on the productivity of the land as the use of farm machinery. We hypothesize that the roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the discovery of a 150-m-long trail of the sauropod Diplodocus carnegii in the Morrison Formation of Colorado, USA. This trail is the longest known in the world and is interpreted as a foraging trail used by the sauropod to feed on the abundant vegetation in the area. This discovery highlights the importance of the ecological role of sauropods in the history of the Earth."
