The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The resolved structure where Ne dissolved in ice II is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. Our work provides a new route to study the structure of hydrate formed by small guest molecules.

The evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been enigmatic, and a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species and a less reduced cnidarian species. Our results show that the myxozoan body plan evolved from a free-living cnidarian and that the extreme reduction in genome size and gene content is characteristic of the Myxozoa. These results provide insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. They also suggest that the Myxozoa are a sister group to the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. This study also highlights the potential of the Myxozoa as a model system for studying the evolution of parasitism. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of proton channels, but the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels is not completely understood. Here, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages. Our results highlight the importance of diet composition in determining trophic interactions and biodiversity in herbivore communities. They also suggest that L megaherbivore diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.

We show that IGF2BP1 is developmentally downregulated in erythroid tissues and that overexpression of IGF2BP1 in primary human erythroid cells results in a reversal of the adult hemoglobin expression pattern toward a more fetal-like phenotype. This phenotype is mediated by reduced BCL11A protein expression and mRNA stability. These results suggest a mechanism for chronoregulation of fetal and adult hemoglobin expression in humans. This mechanism may be relevant to the hemoglobin expression pattern in erythropoietic disorders. The results also have implications for the role of IGF2BP1 in cancer.

Ferroptosis, a form of regulated necrosis driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, is a promising target for cancer therapy. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells are largely unknown. Here, we show that the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis protects cancer cells from ferroptosis through activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), two central regulators of lipid metabolism. We further demonstrate that SREBP1/SCD1-mediated lipogenesis is required for ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells with PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway mutation. These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells and suggest that combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction may be a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. Our study also highlights the importance of targeting lipid metabolism in cancer therapy. This work has implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.

The most common drugs for treating hypertension are L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs). LCCBs are major drugs for treating hypertension, the preeminent risk factor for heart failure. Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) remodeling is a pathological hallmark of chronic hypertension. VSMC remodeling is characterized by molecular rewiring of the cellular Ca2+ signaling machinery, including down-regulation of Cav1.2 channels and up-regulation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stromal-interacting molecule (STIM) Ca2+ sensor proteins and the plasma membrane ORAI Ca2+ channels. STIM/ORAI proteins drive fibro-proliferative gene programs during cardiovascular remodeling. LCCBs act on the STIM N terminus to cause STIM relocalization to junctions and subsequent ORAI activation in a Cav1.2-independent and store depletion-independent manner. LCCB-induced promotion of VSMC remodeling requires STIM1, which is up-regulated in VSMCs from hypertensive rats. Epidemiology showed that LCCBs are more associated with heart failure than other antihypertensive drugs in patients. Our findings unravel a"

We used &gt;25 years of bird surveys to test whether the NWFP’s policy of reducing clearcutting and increasing old-growth habitat improved bird populations. We found that the NWFP halted the decline of early-seral–associated bird populations, but failed to reverse the decline of older-forest–associated species. The NWFP’s success in halting the decline of early-seral–associated species is partly explained by the loss of early-seral habitat due to fire on federal land and continued clearcutting elsewhere. The NWFP’s success in halting the decline of early-seral–associated species is partly explained by the loss of early-seral habitat due to fire on federal land and continued clearcutting elsewhere. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure.

The development of new antibiotics is urgently needed to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. Here, we present a rational design approach to identify new acylide antibiotics. We screened a library of 1,000 compounds for their potential to inhibit the bacterial ribosome. Based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome, we selected 100 compounds for in vitro testing. The best candidate was then evaluated in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

However, in contrast to congenital deficiency, this was not fatal. CTLA-4 deletion induced preferential expansion of CTLA-4+ Treg cells. However, T cells from CTLA-4–deficient inducible KO mice were able to adoptively transfer the diseases into T cell-deficient mice. Notably, cell transfer of thymocytes de novo produced myocarditis, otherwise not observed in donor mice depleted in adulthood. Moreover, CTLA-4 deficiency affects both central and peripheral tolerance and Treg cell-mediated suppression.

Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346–1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats. This study also highlights the importance of using Bayesian inference to test hypotheses based on historical data.

However, current inhibitors cannot distinguish between HSP90 and TRAP1, making their utility as probes of TRAP1-specific function questionable. We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness.

We find that ADF binds to filaments and induces severing when filaments are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist. A simple model, which faithfully recapitulates our experimental observations, indicates that the ADF-induced twist enhances severing 100-fold. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells.

We test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed of Facebook users. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others’ positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.

This correlates with higher expression levels of type I and type III IFN genes and ISGs at 37 °C. Temperature-dependent IFN induction in response to rhinovirus is dependent on the MAVS protein, a key signaling adaptor of the RIG-I–like receptors. Stimulation of mouse airway cells with the synthetic RLR ligand poly I:C leads to greater IFN induction at 37 °C relative to 33 °C at early time points poststimulation and to a sustained increase in the induction of ISGs at 37 °C relative to 33 °C.

This process is mediated by a chemosensory system that regulates the production of cAMP and the expression of hundreds of genes, including key virulence factors. The results support a mechanochemical model where the mechanical activity of the pili is sensed by a chemosensory system, which in turn regulates the pili activity, thereby promoting long-term surface attachment. This study demonstrates that type IV pili are not only used for twitching motility, but also as a sensor regulating surface-induced gene expression and pathogenicity.

Here, we show that the RNA pyrophosphohydrolase RppH assumes a leading role in decapping those transcripts, preferring them as substrates over their triphosphorylated and diphosphorylated counterparts. Unexpectedly, this enzyme recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5′ termini, resulting in a one-nucleotide shift in substrate specificity. The unconventional manner in which RppH recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress. Our findings also suggest that the presence of a dinucleoside tetraphosphate cap can influence the choice of decapping enzyme and the subsequent fate of the RNA.

The mechanisms involved in the immunosuppression that occurs during sepsis are not fully understood. We hypothesized that increasing arginine availability would restore T cell function and decrease immunosuppression during sepsis. We found that citrulline, an arginine metabolite, was more efficient than arginine in increasing arginine plasma levels and restoring T cell mitochondrial function and proliferation while reducing immunosuppression. Because there is no specific therapeutic strategy to restore immune function after sepsis, we believe that our study provides evidence for developing citrulline-based clinical studies in sepsis.

The ancestral environmental temperatures thereby determined for these photic-zone organisms––shown in modern taxa to correlate strongly with NDK thermostability––are inferred to reflect ancient surface-environment paleotemperatures. Our results suggest that Earth’s surface temperature decreased over geological time from ∼65–80 °C in the Archean, a finding consistent both with previous isotope-based and protein reconstruction-based interpretations.

We show that the reduction in the bending modulus of the RBC membrane is correlated with parasite invasion efficiency. These findings suggest that the malaria parasite primes the RBC surface through its binding antigens, altering the biophysical nature of the target cell and thus reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion. This would constitute a major change in our concept of malaria parasite invasion, suggesting it is, in fact, a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces working together to facilitate entry.

We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition.

This merge operation was applied equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity. More superficial models of language, based solely on sequential transition probability over lexical and syntactic categories, only captured activity in the posterior middle temporal gyrus. Formal model comparison indicated that the model of multiword phrase construction provided a better fit than probability-based models at most sites in superior temporal and inferior frontal cortices. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases.

We show that a rapid phaseout of fossil-fuel-related emissions and major reductions of other anthropogenic sources are needed to save millions of lives, restore aerosol-perturbed rainfall patterns, and limit global warming to 2 °C. Our results indicate that the health benefits of a phaseout of fossil-fuel-related emissions are comparable to the climate benefits. The health benefits of a phaseout of nonfossil anthropogenic sources are larger than those of fossil-fuel sources. The chemical influence of air pollution on aeolian dust contributes to the aerosol cooling. Since aerosols mask the anthropogenic rise in global temperature, removing pollution particles liberates 0.51(±0.03) °C and all particles 0.73(±0.03) °C warming. The steep temperature increase from removing aerosols can be moderated to about 0.36(±0.06) °C by the simultaneous reduction of tropospheric ozone and methane.

We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4.

Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion.

Here, we report the results of an in vitro evolution experiment that improved the activity of an RNA polymerase ribozyme. The improved polymerase can synthesize a variety of RNA molecules, including aptamers, ribozymes, and tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of PCR.

This will accelerate the development of therapies for ALS. The method can be applied to other neurodegenerative diseases. The method can also be used to study the role of astrocytes in health and disease. The method can be used to study the role of astrocytes in health and disease.

We now demonstrate that Anaplasma induces ticks to express antifreeze glycoprotein (IAFG), which alters the gut microbiota and facilitates Anaplasma colonization. IAFGP binds the terminal d-alanine residue of the pentapeptide chain of bacterial peptidoglycan, resulting in altered permeability and the capacity of bacteria to form biofilms. These findings elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which a human pathogen appropriates an arthropod antibacterial protein to alter the gut microbiota and more effectively colonize the vector. The ability of pathogens to manipulate the gut microbiota of their vector is likely to be a common strategy for enhancing transmission of infectious diseases. This study also highlights the potential of using antifreeze glycoprotein as a vaccine or therapeutic target for vector-borne diseases. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The discovery of a basal pygostylian, Jinguofortis perplexus, adds important information about the origin of the modern avian body plan. Jinguofortisids are the earliest known members of the short-tailed bird group and represent the second earliest diverging group of the Pygostylia. The presence of a fused scapulocoracoid in adult individuals independently evolved in Jinguofortisidae and Confuciusornithiformes may relate to an accelerated osteogenesis during chondrogenesis and likely formed through the heterochronic process of peramorphosis by which these basal taxa retain the scapulocoracoid of the nonavian theropod ancestors with the addition of flight-related modifications. The discovery of Jinguofortis increases the known ecomorphological diversity of basal pygostylians and highlights the importance of developmental plasticity for understanding mosaic evolution in early birds.

This comes from analysis of observations showing that stratospheric water vapor increases with tropospheric temperature, implying the existence of a stratospheric water vapor feedback. We estimate the strength of this feedback in a chemistry–climate model to be +0.3 W/(m2⋅K), which would be a significant contributor to the overall climate sensitivity. One-third of this feedback comes from increases in water vapor entering the stratosphere through the tropical tropopause layer, with the rest coming from increases in water vapor entering through the extratropical tropopause. This finding has implications for the future of the ozone layer. The increase in water vapor in the stratosphere would help to offset the ozone-layer depletion. However, the increase in water vapor in the stratosphere would also increase the absorption of solar radiation, which would lead to a cooling of the stratosphere. This would lead to a decrease in water vapor, which would then lead to a decrease in ozone. This is a positive feedback, and it would lead to a runaway cycle of ozone loss. This would be a problem for the future of the ozone layer. However"

However, some vertebrates have blue-green tissues, which are caused by the presence of biliverdin, a pigment that is formed from the degradation of the protein hemoglobin. The biochemical basis of this phenomenon, called chlorosis, is poorly understood. Here, we show that chlorosis has evolved multiple times during the evolutionary history of anurans, and that the presence of a class of serpins is required for the occurrence of chlorosis. These serpins bind biliverdin and fine-tune the color of the animals, providing the physiological basis for crypsis in green foliage even under near-infrared light. Our results provide evidence of recurrent evolution of chlorosis and introduce a function for a member of the serpin superfamily. They also show that the serpin superfamily is the largest and most diverse group of protease inhibitors.

ALKBH5 overexpression increases the percentage of BCSCs, and NANOG knockdown decreases the percentage of BCSCs. Thus, HIF-dependent ALKBH5 expression in breast cancer cells promotes the BCSC phenotype by demethylating NANOG mRNA m6A residues.

The source of the parchment, often called “uterine vellum,” has been a long-standing controversy in codicology. The Latin term abortivum in many sources has led some scholars to suggest that fetal calves or sheep skins were used. Others have argued that it would not be possible to sustain herds if so many pocket Bibles were made from fetal skins, arguing instead for unexpected alternatives, such as rabbit. Here, we report a simple and objective method to identify the animal origin of parchment. The noninvasive method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals. These results suggest that ultrafine vellum does not necessarily derive from the use of abortive or newborn animals with ultrathin hides, but could equally well reflect a production process that allowed the"

The extinction occurred between 251.941 ± 0.037 and 251.880 ± 0.031 Mya, an interval of 60 ± 48 ka. The carbon cycle was highly volatile immediately preceding the extinction, and the carbon cycle continued to be volatile for ∼500 ka. The extinction and its aftermath will permit a refined evaluation of the relative roles of rate-dependent processes contributing to the extinction, allowing insight into postextinction ecosystem expansion. The age model will also be used to evaluate the plausibility of trigger and kill mechanisms. The age model will be of interest to a broad audience of geologists, paleontologists, and ecologists."

RORαΔIEC mice exhibit excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs.

We find that for most elements, chemical hardness and electronegativity decrease with pressure, consistent with pressure-induced metallization. Furthermore, we discover that pressure-induced s-d orbital transfer makes Ni, Pd, and Pt “pseudo–noble-gas” atoms with a closed d-shell configuration, and the elements preceding them (Fe and, especially, Co, Rh, and Ir) electron acceptors, while the elements right after them (Cu, Ag, Zn, and Cd) become highly electropositive.

This glycan is catabolized by the symbionts, whose activity is dependent on the level of catabolism. The catabolism of the glycan is also required for the acidification of the symbiotic organ, which enhances the activity of the symbionts. We propose that this strategy is used by other hosts to regulate the activities of their associated microbes.

Admixture and demographic growth happened recently, suggesting a rapid settlement of Madagascar during the last millennium. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, there are geographic influences on the present genomic diversity, independent of the admixture, showing that a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. Our results provide insights into the settlement history of Madagascar and the genetic consequences of the human colonization of the island. They also provide a unique resource for studying the genetic history of Madagascar and the Indian Ocean. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The RNA encodes a 28-amino acid protein that increases the activity of aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The protein also interferes with the ability of a second small RNA to repress genes involved in carbon utilization. The RNA and protein compete for the same binding sites on the target genes. This study demonstrates that the translation and base-pairing functions of small RNAs compete for the same binding sites on target genes. This competition is likely to be common in bacteria and other organisms."

Our findings suggest that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner. During the functional reduction process, the elevation of evolutionary rates reaches several new rate equilibria, possibly relating to the modified protein turnover rates in heterotrophic plastids.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of viral RNA synthesis that has shown efficacy in vitro against MERS and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV. Here, we tested the efficacy of prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir treatment in a nonhuman primate model of MERS-CoV infection. Prophylactic treatment prevented the development of clinical disease, while therapeutic treatment reduced virus replication and lung lesions.

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis remain unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We found that pol II stalling at O2-EtdT and N3-EtdT sites is exacerbated by TFIIS-stimulated proofreading activity. Assessment for the impact of the EtdT lesions on individual fidelity checkpoints provided further mechanistic insights, where the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion.

To better understand how sequential proteolysis contributes to MERS-CoV infection, we introduced mutations that blocked the first cleavages of MERS-CoV spike (S) glycoproteins. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past cell-surface proteases and into endosomes, whereas precleaved MERS viruses used endosomal proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry. Uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and"

Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus. This interaction takes place in infected cells and is required for optimal viral replication. Disruption of this interaction nonspecifically decreases the amount of viral RNA in the viral particles, resulting in an eightfold increase in empty viral particles.

However, the functional role of YAP/TAZ in the flow regulation of atheroprone endothelial phenotypes and the consequential development of atherosclerotic lesions has not been investigated. In this study, we found that disturbed flow activated YAP/TAZ in the endothelium to promote the proatherogenic phenotypes of endothelial cells. In addition, inhibition of YAP/TAZ translation by morpholino oligos significantly reduced the size of atherosclerotic lesions. Our results demonstrate a critical role of the activation of YAP/TAZ by disturbed flow in promoting atheroprone phenotypes and atherosclerotic lesion development. Therefore, inhibition of YAP/TAZ activation is a promising athero-protective therapeutic strategy. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the functional role of YAP/TAZ in the flow regulation of atheroprone endothelial phenotypes and the consequential development of atherosclerotic lesions.

We show that human-caused wildfires have become the dominant cause of wildfires in the United States, accounting for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. Human-caused wildfires disproportionally occurred where fuel moisture was higher than lightning-caused fires, thereby helping expand the geographic and seasonal niche of wildfire. Actions to raise awareness and increase management in regions prone to human-started wildfires should be a focus of United States policy to reduce fire risk and associated hazards.

First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

The mechanisms of disease are not fully understood, but the recent surge in cases has led to a global concern. Here we present a mathematical analysis of the within-host dynamics of ZIKV in a nonhuman primate model. We show that the growth and clearance of ZIKV within an individual are highly variable, and that the time to detectable plasma viral load is highly variable. We also show that an antiviral treatment that blocks viral replication can reduce the time to undetectable plasma viral load. However, the treatment must be given prophylactically starting at the time of infection to be effective. In the case of favipiravir, a polymerase inhibitor with activity against ZIKV, we predict that a dose of 150 mg/kg given twice a day starting at the time of infection can reduce the peak median viral load by ∼3 logs and shorten the time to undetectable median viral load by ∼2 d. This treatment is effective in accelerating plasma viral load loss. However, treatment given 2 d postinfection is mostly ineffective in accelerating plasma viral load loss.

In this study, we investigate the consequences of tumorigenesis on the microbiome using a Drosophila intestinal tumor model. We show that upon loss of BMP signaling, tumors lead to aberrant activation of JNK/Mmp2 signaling, followed by intestinal barrier dysfunction and commensal imbalance. In turn, the dysbiotic microbiome triggers a regenerative response and stimulates tumor growth. We find that inhibiting JNK signaling or depleting the microbiome restores barrier function of the intestinal epithelium, leading to a reestablishment of host–microbe homeostasis, and organismic lifespan extension.

We found that the dominant RSN in healthy subjects was topographically similar to the default mode network. In contrast, in Parkinson’s disease (PD), this RSN was subordinated to an independent disease-related pattern. Network functionality was assessed by quantifying metabolic RSN expression in cerebral blood flow PET scans acquired at rest and during task performance.

Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

Moreover, subjects with increased gut permeability also had altered composition and activity of the gut microbiota. These results suggest the existence of a gut–brain axis in alcohol dependence, which implicates the gut microbiota as an actor in the gut barrier and in behavioral disorders.

However, these factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. Our findings have important implications for the conservation and management of biodiversity. They also have implications for the design of climate change adaptation strategies."

It is thought to encode a map of local space, with grid cells representing the local environment and border, head-direction, and object-vector cells representing the global environment. However, the anatomical and functional organization of these cell types is unknown. Here, we used portable two-photon microscopes to record from large numbers of neurons in freely behaving mice. We found that grid cells are strongly coupled among themselves, but have weaker links to border, HD, and OV cells. These findings suggest that grid cells may have a distinct organization from other cell types in MEC. They also provide a platform for future studies of the spatial representation in MEC.

In this study, we show that the flowering signal FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) is required for flowering of both host and parasite. This study illustrates how regressive evolution, commonly found in parasites, may facilitate the physiological synchronization of parasite and host, here allowing the Cuscuta australis parasite to time reproduction exactly with that of their hosts, likely optimizing parasite fitness. This study also demonstrates that FTs can function as an important interplant flowering signal in host–parasite interactions. Understanding the mechanisms of flowering regulation in host–parasite interactions may help to understand the evolution of flowering in plants. This study also illustrates how flowering can be regulated by environmental cues, here day length, in both host and parasite.

We show that the dopamine-containing neurons of the nigrostriatum are not isolated in the striatum but are integrated with other dopamine-containing neurons in the brain. These other dopamine-containing neurons are located in the substantia nigra pars reticulata and pars compacta and are connected to the striatum by striatonigral fibers. We also show that the striatonigral fibers form bouquet-like arborizations that target clusters of dopamine-containing neurons in the substantia nigra. These clusters of neurons are connected to the striatum by the classic nigrostriatal pathway. Thus, the striatonigral fibers form a critical link between the striatum and the dopamine-containing substantia nigra. This finding has implications for understanding the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease and other disorders of the dopamine system. It also suggests that the striatonigral fibers may be a target for therapeutic intervention."

But how do we know when two people are connected? We asked pairs of friends and strangers to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Finally, we demonstrate that this signal is used by third-party listeners as a heuristic of how well people are connected: Conversations with faster response times were perceived as more connected than the same conversations with slower response times. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

SAN cells (SANCs) are responsible for maintaining a normal heart rate and are critical for maintaining cardiac output. SANCs are specialized cardiomyocytes that are characterized by their unique electrophysiological properties and the presence of internal Ca2+ stores. Here, we report that stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is expressed in SANCs and regulates Ca2+ dynamics in SANCs. STIM1 is a multifunctional regulator of Ca2+ dynamics in SANCs that links SR Ca2+ store content with electrical events occurring in the plasma membrane. These studies reveal that STIM1 is a key regulator of SAN automaticity and contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms that govern SAN function.

This interaction between Si and jasmonic acid was dependent on jasmonic acid and jasmonic acid biosynthesis gene OsAOS and on jasmonic acid perception gene OsCOI1. These results suggest that Si and jasmonic acid play a synergistic role in defense against insect herbivores.

The SHMT inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for other diseases. Thus, the SHMT inhibitors are a promising new class of cancer therapeutics. This article is protected by copyright.

In this study, we show that deforestation can affect people’s diets, and that this effect is mediated by the loss of natural landscapes such as forests. Our findings have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. Our results also highlight the need to consider the role of natural landscapes in strategies to improve food and nutrition security."

We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the discovery of a 130-million-year-old footprint of a sauropod in the same formation as the first evidence of subsoil compaction. Our results have important implications for the design of modern farm machinery and the management of soil resources. They also suggest that the ecological strategies"
