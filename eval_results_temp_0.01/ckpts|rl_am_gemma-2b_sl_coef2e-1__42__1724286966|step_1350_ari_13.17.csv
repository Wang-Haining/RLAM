The structure of ice II is of great importance for understanding the origin of the high-pressure phase of water. The structure of ice II is also of great importance for understanding the structure of the Earth’s interior. In this work, we report the structure of ice II at high pressure and temperature. The structure of ice II is found to be the hydrate of neon in water. This finding has important implications for the structure of ice II. It also provides a new route to the synthesis of hydrates.

In this paper, we provide a purely categorical approach to the foundations of quantum theory. The approach is based on a set of axioms that are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. The axioms are designed to guarantee that the category of Hilbert spaces and bounded operators is equivalent to the category of continuous linear functions between Hilbert spaces. The approach provides a mathematical foundation for quantum theory that is independent of any particular mathematical structure. It is therefore a step toward a solution of the mathematical foundations problem."

The evolutionary origin of the myxozoan body plan is enigmatic, and the group is hypothesized to have originated from a close relationship with the cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids. Here, we present the first comparative genomic analysis of two distantly related myxozoan species and a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insight into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Show more)"

The virus responsible for this pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is able to evade the antiviral action of interferon (IFN) by blocking nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2. Here, we show that the viral accessory protein ORF6 is responsible for this evasion. We show that ORF6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs ORF6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This mechanism may be exploited by other viruses as well. Our findings may provide a basis for the development of new antiviral strategies.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. Sperm cells are quiescent in the male reproductive system due to Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1 channels, but become active once introduced into the low-Zn2+-concentration environment of the female reproductive tract. How Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide"

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is largely unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa in herbivore feces. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammal species in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results highlight the importance of diet composition in understanding the role of LMH in ecosystems. This approach could be applied to other taxa to better understand the role of diet in community assembly. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

We determined the ages of the grains and found that the majority of the grains are younger than 1 Ga. This is in contrast to theoretical predictions for the ages of the grains. We suggest that the grains were part of aggregates in the interstellar medium and acquired the bulk of their cosmogenic nuclides during their time in the interstellar medium.

No treatment is currently available to slow down the aggressive neurodegenerative process, and patients die within a few years after disease onset.

Several studies point to α-syn oligomerization and aggregation as a mediator of neurotoxicity in synucleinopathies including MSA. Here we present an in vivo proof of concept of the ability of the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 to mitigate α-syn pathology and to mediate neuroprotection in a mouse model of MSA.

The digitally synthesized structures exhibit organic shapes and motions with irregular distributions of material phases. Within the structures, different materials play distinct roles yet seamlessly collaborate through sophisticated deformation mechanisms to produce the target behaviors. While complex in geometry and material heterogeneity, the discovered structures are effectively manufactured via multimaterial fabrication with different polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomers with distinct behaviors and their highly nonlinear responses are physically and accurately realized in experiments. To enhance programmability, the synthesized structures are heteroassembled into architectures that exhibit highly complex yet navigable responses.

Calcium channel blockers are the most widely used drugs for treating hypertension. However, the mechanisms of action of these drugs are not fully understood. Here, we show that the three major classes of calcium channel blockers activate STIM/ORAI-mediated Ca2+ entry in vascular smooth muscle cells. Our data indicate caution against the use of calcium channel blockers in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. Our findings unravel a mechanism of calcium channel blockers action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrate that calcium channel blockers promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. This study provides a rationale for the use of calcium channel blockers in the treatment of cardiovascular remodeling. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The best compound identified by us is up to 56 times more active than telithromycin, a clinically used antibiotic. This compound is also more accessible, has higher solubility, and exhibits better membrane permeability than telithromycin. Thus, our approach can be used to identify new antibiotics with improved properties. This approach can be applied to other antibiotic classes as well.

Here, we show that CTLA-4 is essential for the development of autoimmunity in adult mice, but not in congenital CTLA-4–deficient mice. CTLA-4 deletion in adult mice resulted in lymphoproliferation, hypergammaglobulinemia, and histologically evident pneumonitis, gastritis, insulitis, and sialadenitis, accompanied by organ-specific autoantibodies. However, in contrast to congenital deficiency, this was not fatal. CTLA-4 deletion induced preferential expansion of CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells. However, T cells from CTLA-4–deficient inducible KO mice were able to adoptively transfer the diseases into T cell-deficient mice. This indicates that CTLA-4 deficiency affects both central and peripheral tolerance and Treg cell-mediated suppression.

These social-learning conditions were compared with an asocial individual-learning condition in which individual participants made repeated attempts at constructing a paper plane, without having access to any planes produced by other participants. Larger populations generated greater variation in plane performance and gave participants access to better-adapted planes, but this did not enhance CCE. In fact, there was an inverse relationship between population size and CCE: plane flight distance did not improve over the experimental generations in the 2-Model and 4-Model conditions, but did improve over generations in the 1-Model social-learning condition.

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal cells is not well understood. Here we show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. Thus, TRAP1 may be a promising target for cancer therapy. (Show more)"

They are dynamic structures that can be assembled and disassembled. The disassembly process is controlled by the actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin family of proteins. However, how ADF/cofilin proteins sever actin filaments in a physiological context, where filaments are interconnected and under mechanical stress, remains unclear. Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to study the action of ADF/cofilin in different mechanical situations. We find that local curvature favors severing, while tension has no effect on cofilin binding and weakly enhances severing. Remarkably, we observe that filament segments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist, experience a mechanical torque upon cofilin binding. We propose that this ADF/cofilin-induced torque increases the severing rate constant 100-fold. A consequence of this mechanism is that cross-linked filament networks are severed by cofilin far more efficiently than nonconnected filaments. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. Our findings provide insights into the"

These findings demonstrate that type IV pili can be used as a sensor for surface-specific attachment, and that the mechanical activity of pili can be used as a signal for regulation of surface-induced gene expression and pathogenicity. This mechanism may be important for the survival of P. aeruginosa in the environment and in the host. Understanding how bacteria use pili for sensing and signaling may provide insights into the regulation of surface-induced gene expression and pathogenicity.

We identify an inflammatory profile unique to Aβ-burdened neurons, since neighboring glial cells did not express similar molecules. Moreover, we demonstrate within disease-vulnerable regions of the human brain that a neuron-specific inflammatory response may precede insoluble Aβ plaque and tau tangle formation. Thus, we reveal the Aβ-burdened neuron as a primary proinflammatory agent, implicating the intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ as a significant immunological component in the AD pathogenesis.

In this study, we provide a comprehensive characterization of the proteome dynamics of Drosophila sperm during their posttesticular life history. We show that the proteome of Drosophila sperm undergoes substantial compositional changes after being transferred to the female reproductive tract. We also demonstrate that female-derived proteins are enriched in the sperm proteome following mating and sperm storage in the female reproductive tract. These findings provide a comprehensive characterization of the proteome dynamics of sperm during their posttesticular life history and expand our understanding of the critical process of sperm–FRT interactions. This work will be of interest to the broader scientific community and will be useful for understanding the molecular basis of sperm–FRT interactions in other species. (Show more)"

The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks an intracellular activation gate and normally shows no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. These findings provide insights into the regulation of K+ channel gating and inactivation. They also suggest that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation.

More importantly, the merge operation is implemented by multiple superior temporal and inferior frontal regions, providing initial evidence for a neural implementation of the merge operation postulated by linguists.

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, in the days (Studies 1 and 2) and months (Studies 3 through 6) following the 2016 American presidential election, women’s and men’s endorsement of hegemonic masculinity predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. In addition, as conceptualized, hegemonic masculinity predicted less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how HKU4 and HKU5 transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions.

We found that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion.

Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

We identify 225 latent topics in the narratives (e.g., preparation for death and physical aggression); many of these topics are not captured by existing structured variables. Motivated by known patterns in suicide and homicide by gender and recent research on gender biases in semantic space, we identify the gender bias of our topics (e.g., a topic about pain medication is feminine). We then compare the gender bias of topics to their prevalence in narratives of female versus male victims. Results provide a detailed quantitative picture of reporting about lethal violence and its gendered nature.

As an alternative approach, extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying the convergence of the targets and functions of the autism-risk genes to facilitate mapping out causal paths. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. Mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility"

The inhibitor is effective in inhibiting SHMT in cancer cells, and in particular, in blocking the growth of a particularly sensitive cancer cell-line screen of B-cell malignancies. We also show that one of the few metabolic consequences of SHMT inhibition is increased formate utilization, which paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in a subset of cancer cell lines.

To explain the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in ALS, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

Virions require spike (S) proteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Virions must first be cleaved sequentially by cell-surface proteases, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. Here, we show that the first cleavages are significant for virus infection, because they allow virions to resist cell-receptor-induced conformational changes, which restrict the second, fusion-activating cleavages. These findings suggest that the first cleavages are significant for MERS-CoV virulence, because they expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection. Therefore, the first cleavages may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV pathogenesis. Thus, understanding how the first cleavages contribute to CoV infection may help to explain why MERS-CoV causes severe disease in humans.

However, the mechanisms underlying the development of cerebral edema in hypoxia are not fully understood. Here we show that hypoxia induces cerebral edema in rats and that this is mediated by the hypoxic-induced release of corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) from the hypothalamus. CRF acts on the cortex to trigger signaling of cAMP/PKA in cortical astrocytes, leading to activation of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and cerebral edema. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the development of cerebral edema in hypoxia. They also suggest that the CRF system may be a potential target for the treatment of cerebral edema in hypoxia. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The economic and ecological costs of wildfire have risen substantially in recent decades. Although climate change has likely enabled a portion of the increase in wildfire activity, the direct role of people in increasing wildfire activity has been largely overlooked. We show that humans have vastly expanded the spatial and seasonal “fire niche” in the United States, accounting for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. Human-caused wildfires disproportionally occurred where fuel moisture was higher than lightning-started fires, thereby helping expand the geographic and seasonal niche of wildfire. Actions to raise awareness and increase management in regions prone to human-started wildfires should be a focus of United States policy to reduce fire risk and associated hazards.

Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

Here, we show that the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis is driven by altered nutrient cycling during heat stress. We demonstrate that the metabolic energy demand of the coral host increases during heat stress, which is compensated by the degradation of amino acids. The resulting shift from net uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont subsequently promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host. Our results provide a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

These results define an additional 5′ RNA cap structure in eukaryotes and raise the possibility that this 5′ NAD+ cap could modulate RNA stability and translation on specific subclasses of mRNAs. This modification may be important in the regulation of mitochondrial gene expression. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The mechanisms of metabolic memory are not fully understood. Here we show that epigenetic DNA methylation alterations at specific loci in whole blood and monocytes persist for several years during the follow-up of people with diabetes. These epigenetic alterations are associated with glycemia and support an epigenetic explanation for metabolic memory. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms of metabolic memory and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of diabetes.

The role of the fibrous sheath interacting protein 1 (FSIP1) in TNBC has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. (Show more)"

However, these factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. Our findings have important implications for our ability to predict the impacts of climate change on ecosystem functioning. They also highlight the importance of considering the combined effects of biodiversity loss and environmental warming in the design of effective conservation and management strategies. This is particularly important in light of the current global biodiversity crisis."

However, the evolution of specialization is often considered a dead end, because predators become specialized, and then they become adapted to their prey type, and then they become specialized on other prey types. We show that this evolutionary process is not a dead end, and that predators can evolve into new prey types. This process is driven by the evolution of specialized structures, and the evolution of specialization between these structures and prey type."

The fossil record for the evolution of the human hand is incomplete, however, and the origin of some of the key derived features of the modern human hand is unclear. Here we report the discovery of a hominin hand fossil from East Africa that preserves the third metacarpal styloid process, a key derived feature of the human hand. This fossil provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of this key derived feature of the human hand."

One of the key metabolic pathways supporting cell growth is the one-carbon unit biosynthetic pathway, which converts serine to glycine and a folate-derived carbon unit. We have developed a series of small-molecule inhibitors of serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), a key enzyme in this pathway. We show that these inhibitors are effective in vitro and in vivo, and that they are particularly effective in B-cell malignancies. We also show that one of the inhibitors is uniquely effective in a lymphoma cell line that is deficient in glycine import. Thus, we have identified a metabolic vulnerability of lymphoma cells that can be targeted therapeutically. This work provides a rationale for targeting the one-carbon unit biosynthetic pathway in cancer. This pathway is a promising target for cancer therapy, and our work provides a starting point for the development of such agents. This work also provides a proof-of-concept for the use of one-carbon unit inhibitors as cancer therapeutics."

However, the agricultural sector is also responsible for the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of natural resources. This study shows that forests can be a source of food and nutrition security, and that deforestation can have negative impacts on people’s diets. This study has important implications for policy makers, who should consider the role of forests in meeting food and nutrition security goals."

We show that the increase in vehicle weight has propagated subsoil compaction into deeper soil layers, exceeding safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the discovery of a 100-m-long, 10-m-wide, and 1.5-m-deep trench in the Argentinian Patagonia, which may have been dug by"
