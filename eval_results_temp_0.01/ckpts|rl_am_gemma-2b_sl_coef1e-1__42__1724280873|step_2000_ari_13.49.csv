The guest atoms are free to move in the hydrate structure, which is different from the previous studies of hydrate with guest molecules. This work provides a new insight into the structure of hydrate with guest atoms. It is expected to provide a reference for the transport of gas in the deep ocean. (Show more)"

Here, we report the genomes of two myxozoans, which are related to each other but distantly related to the model parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results show that the myxozoan genome is one of the smallest reported animal genomes and that the myxozoan body plan is reduced in gene content.

We found that SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.

Zinc is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of zinc inhibition of the proton channel Hv1. We find that zinc binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the zinc-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how zinc inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

We use global datasets of maize production and climate variability combined with future temperature projections to quantify how yield variability will change in the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. We find that as the global mean temperature increases, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields increases almost everywhere to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields. For the top four maize-exporting countries, which account for 87% of global maize exports, the probability that they have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming.

These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammal assemblages, and that diversity of large mammals may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.

Here we show that anxiety, a personality trait, directly influences social dominance in rats and identify an important mediating role for mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens. High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low-anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as increased oxidative stress in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals. We conclude that mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens is crucial for social behavior and is critically involved in the low social competitiveness associated with high anxiety.

These drugs are used in millions of patients worldwide. However, the mechanisms of action of these drugs are not fully understood. Here, we show that the three major classes of calcium channel blockers activate STIM/ORAI-mediated Ca2+ entry in vascular smooth muscle cells. Our data indicate caution against the use of these drugs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. Our findings unravel a mechanism of LCCBs action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms of action of these drugs and may lead to the development of new drugs with a different mechanism of action.

Our results show that the NWFP was effective in halting the decline of early-seral bird populations, but that the policy failed to halt the decline of older-forest–associated bird populations. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure.

This problem can be addressed by the development of new antibacterial agents to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. Computational approaches are essential tools to this end since their application enables fast and early strategical decisions in the drug development process. We present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. This study provides a proof of concept for the rational design of antibiotics. The approach presented here can be applied to other antibiotic classes and to other targets. The design of antibiotics is a complex problem, and the presented approach is a first step toward the development of new antibiotics. It is expected that the presented"

TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1 may act as a tumor suppressor in some settings."

One of the most important proteins that regulate the dynamics of actin filaments is cofilin. Cofilin is a small protein that is able to sever actin filaments. However, how it does so is not understood. Here, we show that cofilin binds to actin filaments in a mechanical manner, and that the binding induces a mechanical torque that enhances severing. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. We propose that this mechanism is a general principle of actin filament severing."

However, the results of this study suggest that the health benefits of fructose may be limited. Ingestion of fructose relative to glucose resulted in greater brain activation in regions involved in attention and reward processing and promoted greater hunger and desire for food and a willingness to give up long-term monetary rewards to obtain immediate high-calorie foods. These findings suggest that fructose may be a weaker suppressor of appetite than glucose. The results also have implications for the interpretation of neuroimaging studies of food cues and food-approach behavior in a fasted state."

Here we demonstrate that the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa detects contact with surfaces on short timescales using the mechanical activity of its type IV pili, a major surface adhesin. This signal transduction mechanism requires attachment of type IV pili to a solid surface, followed by pilus retraction and signal transduction through the Chp chemosensory system, a chemotaxis-like sensory system that regulates cAMP production and transcription of hundreds of genes, including key virulence factors. Like other chemotaxis pathways, pili-mediated surface sensing results in a transient response amplified by a positive feedback that increases type IV pili activity, thereby promoting long-term surface attachment that can stimulate additional virulence and biofilm-inducing pathways. The methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein-like chemosensor PilJ directly interacts with the major pilin subunit PilA. Our results thus support a mechanochemical model where a chemosensory system measures the mechanically induced conformational changes in stretched type IV pili. These findings demonstrate that P. aeruginosa not only uses type IV pili for surface-specific twitching motility, but also as a sensor regulating"

However, the ACI is difficult to be well represented in current climate models. This is due to the complexity of the process and the lack of observational capability. To overcome this conundrum, we introduce the dual-FOV high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) for simultaneously profiling aerosol and cloud properties. The instrument is able to measure aerosol and cloud properties with high spatial and temporal resolution. This instrument is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI. The observations obtained from the dual-FOV HSRL constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI process.

They open and close their pore gates to allow or block ion flow. K+ channels commonly possess two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that BK channels can exhibit C-type inactivation with a mutation that causes a greatly accelerated rate of C-type inactivation or constitutive C-inactivation. C-type inactivation in BK channels is closed state-dependent and can occur during hyperpolarized membrane potentials or with decreased intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i). We propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. Our findings may help to understand the mechanism of K+ channel regulation.

The invasion process is poorly understood, and the parasite’s interaction with the RBC is thought to be mediated by a number of adhesins. Here, we show that the interaction between the parasite’s erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 (EBA175) and the RBC’s glycophorin A receptor alters the physical properties of the RBC, reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion.

In temperate regions, seasonal outbreaks of influenza virus correlate with decreases in ambient humidity. The impact of humidity on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the impact of ambient humidity on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome. They also suggest that low humidity may be a modifiable risk factor for influenza severity. Our study may also have implications for the development of influenza vaccines and antiviral therapies.

This merge operation is consistent with the predictions of a model of phrase construction and provides initial evidence for a neural implementation of the merge operation postulated by linguists.

In resource-scarce settings, where outbreaks are likely to emerge, the capacity to detect and respond to emerging pathogens is limited. We used a global cloud-based metagenomic sequencing platform to investigate the pathogen landscape of undifferentiated febrile illness in a periurban population in Cambodia. We identified a variety of vector-borne, zoonotic, and emerging pathogens, including chikungunya virus, which presaged a national outbreak. Our results highlight the potential of mNGS to detect a broad range of pathogens in resource-scarce settings. Coordinated and ongoing pathogen surveillance can better identify the breadth of endemic, zoonotic, or emerging pathogens and deployment of rapid public health response. This approach can be applied in other resource-limited settings to better understand the pathogen landscape and mitigate the impact of emerging pathogens. This article is protected by copyright.

It is a large enzyme that is anchored to the PCNA sliding clamp to form a holoenzyme. The stability of this complex is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. We designed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. Surprisingly, the results indicate that human pol δ maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This study provides a unique perspective on the stability of a large enzyme holoenzyme and its implications for DNA replication. It also provides a foundation for the development of new inhibitors of lagging strand synthesis.

Here, we show that the squid Euprymna scolopes regulates the provision of a single glycan, chitin, to its symbiotic bacterium, Vibrio fischeri, in a diel rhythm. We also show that the timing of chitin provision is critical for the persistence of the symbiont, and that the provision of chitin is required for the periodic acidification of the symbiotic crypts, which increases the oxygen available to the symbionts. These results provide a mechanistic explanation for the timing of nutrient provision in animal-microbe mutualisms. (Show more)"

We introduce a method to identify topics in a corpus and represent documents as topic sequences. We draw on advances in theoretical machine learning to integrate topic modeling and word embedding, capitalizing on their distinct capabilities. We illustrate our method with a prominent example of underutilized text: the US National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). We identify 225 latent topics in the narratives (e.g., preparation for death and physical aggression); many of these topics are not captured by existing structured variables. We then compare the gender bias of topics to their prevalence in narratives of female versus male victims. Results provide a detailed quantitative picture of reporting about lethal violence and its gendered nature. Our method offers a flexible and broadly applicable approach to model topics in text data. We hope it will be useful to researchers in many fields."

This epidemic marked the start of the second plague pandemic, which lasted in Europe until the early 19th century. This pandemic is generally understood as the consequence of a singular introduction of Yersinia pestis, after which the disease established itself in European rodents over four centuries. To locate these putative plague reservoirs, we studied the climate fluctuations that preceded regional plague epidemics, based on a dataset of 7,711 georeferenced historical plague outbreaks and 15 annually resolved tree-ring records from Europe and Asia. We provide evidence for repeated climate-driven reintroductions of the bacterium into European harbors from reservoirs in Asia, with a delay of 15 ± 1 y. Our analysis finds no support for the existence of permanent plague reservoirs in medieval Europe. Our results have implications for the understanding of the spread of the plague in Europe and the development of the Black Death pandemic. (Less)"

We show here that monoclonal antibodies targeting the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This study provides a proof-of-concept for the use of antibodies targeting IL1RAP as a treatment for AML. This approach could be extended to other targets that are expressed on leukemic stem cells.

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

We show that the loss of photosynthesis is linked to the loss of function in all plastid genes, which is in turn linked to the loss of the host. Our findings suggest that the loss of function in plastid genes is a gradual process, with bursts of gene losses occurring in parallel with periods of relaxed selection. The evolutionary rates and selection pressure coevolve with the macrostructural and microstructural changes in the plastid genome. The evolutionary rates reach several new rate equilibria during the process of functional reduction. These equilibria are linked to the modified turnover rates of the proteins in the heterotrophic plastids.

We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting.

However, the factors that contribute to virus spillover from bats are not well understood. Here, we identified and characterized an immunosuppressant protein (MTX) that is highly concentrated in the submandibular salivary gland of the bat, Myotis pilosus. MTX selectively inhibits the epoxide hydrolase function of leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) to inhibit LTA4 hydrolysis and the generation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a potent lipid chemoattractant for host defense against infection. MTX potently inhibited proinflammatory proteases to induce immune tolerance and maintain high stability. In mouse models, influenza A virus (IAV) H1N1 infection and pathogenicity were exacerbated by MTX but were reversed by interfering with the effects of MTX on LTA4H or exogenous LTB4 administration. This study provides deeper insight into immunologically privileged sites for microbial community residence in bats and supports the therapeutic potential of targeting MTX-LTA4H. This study also provides a deeper understanding of the role of MTX in the immune"

These proteins form intracellular inclusion bodies that are characteristic of different neuropathological subtypes of the disease. We show that the proteins that form inclusions of mutant SOD1, TDP-43, and FUS are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. To explain the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in the brain and spinal cord, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. Our results provide a unifying explanation for the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in ALS and other neurodegenerative disorders. This approach can be applied to other neurodegenerative diseases to identify metastable proteins that are likely to be coaggregating in inclusions."

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas the more rigid uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into"

In the last decade, two new RTKs have been identified, ALKAL1 and ALKAL2, which are oncogenes in human cancer. Here, we show that zebrafish deficient in ALKAL1 and ALKAL2 display a severe defect in pigment patterning. We further show that these defects are mediated by a third ligand of ALKAL1 and ALKAL2, which is encoded by zebrafish. This study establishes a physiological link between ALKAL1 and ALKAL2 and their ligand and demonstrates that the ligand is essential for zebrafish pigment patterning. These findings are important for understanding the function of ALKAL1 and ALKAL2 in vivo and for developing new therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment. This article is protected by copyright.

We asked pairs of friends and strangers to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Finally, we demonstrate that this signal is used by third-party listeners as a heuristic of how well people are connected: Conversations with faster response times were perceived as more connected than the same conversations with slower response times.
