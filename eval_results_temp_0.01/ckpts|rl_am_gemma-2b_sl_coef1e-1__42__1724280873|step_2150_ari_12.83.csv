In this paper, we report the synthesis of neon hydrate, which is the first example of a hydrate with guest atoms in the ice II structure. The guest atoms are located in the centers of the channels, and they have substantial freedom of movement. This study provides a new perspective on the structure of ice II and the nature of hydrate formation. It also provides a new route to the synthesis of hydrates with guest atoms in the ice II structure. This work will be of interest to researchers in the fields of hydrate, ice, and chemistry."

Our results show that the SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and interacts with Nup98-Rae1 to impair docking of the cargo-receptor complex and disrupt nuclear import. This mechanism of viral antagonism is a common strategy used by many viruses to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.

Zinc is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of zinc inhibition of proton channels. We find that zinc binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the zinc-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how zinc inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

Here, we quantify the impact of climate change on maize yields and yield variability in the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries. We find that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields increases almost everywhere to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields. For the top four maize-exporting countries, which account for 87% of global maize exports, the probability that they have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. They also underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance."

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species of large mammal in semiarid African savanna. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers. We found that species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption had the greatest overlap in diet composition. Our results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammal assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This work provides a framework for understanding the role of niche partitioning in the ecology and evolution of large mammal assemblages.

However, the magnitude of the problem is still unclear. We show that the global load of floating plastic debris is far less than expected, and that most of it is concentrated in convergence zones of the five subtropical gyres. This distribution is mostly due to the selective removal of millimeter-sized fragments of plastic, which are rapidly degraded into smaller particles. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

This problem can be addressed by the development of new antibacterial agents to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. Computational approaches are essential tools to this end since their application enables fast and early strategical decisions in the drug development process. We present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. This study provides a proof of concept for the rational design of new antibiotics. It also demonstrates the potential of computational approaches in the early stages of drug development. This approach can be extended to other antibiotic classes. (Show more)"

However, the nucleation of the stable, hexagonal, close-packed (hcp) phase of iron, which is the main component of the inner core, has been shown to require an unrealistic degree of undercooling. This contradiction is referred to as the inner core nucleation paradox. We show that the nucleation of the stable, body-centered, cubic (bcc) phase of iron, which is also the main component of the inner core, is much more likely to occur under inner core conditions. This mechanism reduces the required undercooling of iron nucleation, which provides a key factor in solving the inner core nucleation paradox.

TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes.

This finding is important for understanding the role of cofilin in cells."

Here we show that the type IV pili of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa are also involved in sensing the environment. This sensing is mediated by the Chp chemosensory system, which regulates the production of cAMP and transcription of hundreds of genes, including key virulence factors. The Chp system is activated by the mechanical activity of the pili, which are used as a mechanosensitive sensor. This mechanosensitive system is important for the pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa, as it promotes long-term attachment to surfaces, which is a key step in the pathogenesis of this bacterium.

The disease is characterized by chronic inflammation, which is most often attributed to sustained microglial activation in response to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque deposits and cell death. However, this response is not observed in transgenic animal models devoid of such pathologies, suggesting that the underlying processes may be more complex. Here, we show that neurons, which are the primary cell type affected in AD, are capable of producing a variety of potent immune factors, even in the absence of extracellular plaques and cell death. These findings reveal a neuron-specific inflammatory response, which may precede the formation of Aβ plaques and tau tangles. Thus, we propose that the intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ may be a significant immunological component in the AD pathogenesis. This study provides a new perspective on the disease and may lead to the development of novel therapeutics. (Show more)"

This enzyme recognizes capped 5′ ends by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5′ termini, resulting in a one-nucleotide shift in substrate specificity. The unconventional manner in which this enzyme recognizes capped 5′ ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress.

They open and close their pores to allow or block ion flow. K+ channels commonly possess two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. We found that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. C-type inactivation in BK channels occurs during hyperpolarized membrane potentials or with decreased intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) and recovers with depolarized membrane potentials or elevated [Ca2+]i. This finding suggests that C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. These findings provide insights into the mechanism of K+ channel gating and may lead to the development of new drugs for treating diseases. This article is protected by copyright.

In the temperate regions, seasonal influenza outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in ambient humidity. While low humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the impact of low humidity on influenza virus infection and disease outcome.

Whether and how this merge operation is implemented in the brain remains unknown. Here, we show that high-gamma power increases with each successive word in a sentence but decreases suddenly whenever words can be merged into a phrase. This pattern of activity was observed in multiple superior temporal and inferior frontal language-related areas, providing evidence for a merge operation that applies equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity. More superficial models of language, based solely on sequential transition probability over lexical and syntactic categories, only captured activity in the posterior middle temporal gyrus. Formal model comparison indicated that the model of multiword phrase construction provided a better fit than probability-based models at most sites in superior temporal and inferior frontal cortices. Activity in those regions was consistent with a neural implementation of a bottom-up or left-corner parser of the incoming language stream.

We find that it can avoid an excess mortality rate of 3.61 million per year from outdoor air pollution worldwide.

Globally, fossil-fuel-related emissions account for about 65% of the excess mortality, and 70% of the climate cooling by anthropogenic aerosols. The chemical influence of air pollution on aeolian dust contributes to the aerosol cooling. Since aerosols mask the anthropogenic rise in global temperature, removing fossil-fuel-generated particles liberates 0.51 °C and all pollution particles 0.73 °C warming, reaching around 2 °C over North America and Northeast Asia. The steep temperature increase from removing aerosols can be moderated to about 0.36 °C globally by the simultaneous reduction of tropospheric ozone and methane. We conclude that a rapid phaseout of fossil-fuel-related emissions and major reductions of other anthropogenic sources are needed to save millions of lives, restore aerosol-perturbed rainfall patterns, and limit global warming to 2 °C"

Early detection of chikungunya virus presaged a larger national outbreak of more than 6,000 cases. This study demonstrates the feasibility of pathogen surveillance in resource-scarce settings and the potential for rapid public health response. Coordinated and ongoing pathogen surveillance can better identify the breadth of endemic, zoonotic, or emerging pathogens and deployment of rapid public health response.

This process is essential for the survival of the cell and the organism. The process is complex and requires the cooperation of many proteins. One of the most important proteins is the sliding clamp, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). PCNA is essential for the replication of the lagging strand of DNA. It is also essential for the repair of DNA lesions. We have developed a series of assays to study the interaction of PCNA with DNA polymerase δ (pol δ). These assays allow us to study the interaction of pol δ with PCNA in a way that has not been possible before. We have found that pol δ is not as stable as previously thought.

However, the mechanisms by which this is achieved are not well understood. Here, we show that the provision of a single glycan, chitin, is sufficient to maintain the health of a symbiont in a mutualism between a squid and its luminescent bacterium. This glycan is released by host cells in a specific manner, which is only established after the squid has colonized its host for a sufficient period of time. This glycan is then catabolized by the symbiont, which is required for the maintenance of the symbiosis. This work provides a new perspective on the regulation of symbioses and the potential for the use of glycans as a means of controlling the activities of microbes in the body. (Show more)"

There is an urgent need for novel and more efficient therapies, ideally targeting AML stem cells that are essential for maintaining the disease. Here, we show that monoclonal antibodies targeting the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This study provides a proof-of-concept for the use of antibodies targeting IL1RAP as a treatment for AML."

However, the factors that contribute to virus spillover from bats are not well understood.

MTX is a potent immunosuppressant that inhibits the epoxide hydrolase function of leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) to inhibit LTA4 hydrolysis and the generation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a potent lipid chemoattractant for host defense against infection.

One of the key metabolic pathways that supports cell growth is the one-carbon unit cycle, which is supported by the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). SHMT is up-regulated in cancer, and the enzyme has been the target of small-molecule inhibitors. Here we report the discovery of dual SHMT1/2 inhibitors, which are effective in vitro and in vivo. We also report a unique sensitivity of B-cell lymphoma cell lines to SHMT inhibition, which is rooted in defective glycine import. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of B-cell lymphoma. This work provides a foundation for the development of metabolic inhibitors of cancer. (Show more)"

Here, we show that the presence of coaggregating proteins in ALS is not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. To explain the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in the brain and spinal cord, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. This study provides a new perspective on the pathogenesis of ALS and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies. (Show more)"

An optical conveyor technique is presented for continuously loading atoms into the desired trapping positions with optimal coupling to the photonic crystal. The device configuration also enables application of optical tweezers for controlled placement of atoms. Devices can be fabricated reliably from a 200-nm silicon nitride device layer using a lithography-based process, producing predicted optical properties in transmission and reflection measurements.

However, the molecular mechanism of how DNA alkylation affects transcription remains unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated the impact of DNA alkylation on transcription. We found that the transcription of alkylated DNA is controlled by multiple fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion. For the N3-EtdT lesion that disrupts base pairing, multiple transcriptional lesion bypass routes were found. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop). The Pro-Gate loop faces toward the minor groove of RNA:DNA hybrid and is involved in modulating the translocation of minor-groove alkylated DNA template after nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. We found that sequential proteolysis of MERS S proteins is required for efficient infection of human lung-derived cells, but not for infection into other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Therefore, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence. These findings may also be relevant to other coronaviruses. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Surprisingly, STING deficiency in β-cells impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, suggesting a possible role of STING in β-cell dysfunction. Indeed, STING deficiency decreased expression of β-cell function–related genes, contributing to impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Moreover, the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) and cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&amp;Tag) analyses suggested that Pax6 was the transcription factor that might be associated with defective glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in STING-deficient β-cells. These data revealed a function of STING in the regulation of insulin secretion and established pathophysiological significance of fine-tuned STING within β-cells and insulin target tissues for maintaining glucose homeostasis. These findings may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for T2D"

Their genome is segmented into eight fragments, which offers evolutionary advantages but complicates genomic packaging. Here, we identified a direct interaction between two viral RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus. This interaction is required for optimal viral replication and takes place in infected cells. We also show that this interaction favors the copackaging of the interacting RNA segments. Our results indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions. The lack of conservation of these interactions might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses. This work provides a molecular understanding of the selective packaging mechanism of influenza A virus. (Show more)"

The development of these lesions is a multistep process that involves the accumulation of atheroprone phenotypes in the arterial wall. The objective of this study was to investigate the functional role of Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) in the disturbed flow-induced atheroprone phenotypes and the consequential development of atherosclerotic lesions. Our results demonstrate that the activation of YAP/TAZ by disturbed flow is a critical event in the development of atheroprone phenotypes and atherosclerotic lesions. Therefore, inhibition of YAP/TAZ activation is a promising athero-protective therapeutic strategy. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the functional role of YAP/TAZ in the development of atherosclerotic lesions and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of atherosclerosis.

Specifically, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements. Neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods.

This may be an important mechanism for the success of this parasite."

SAN cells (SANCs) are responsible for generating the heart rate and are characterized by their unique electrophysiological properties. The SAN is also the site of the cardiac pacemaker potential, which is generated by a network of voltage-gated ion channels. Here, we report that stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and Orai1 channels, key components of store-operated Ca2+ entry, are selectively expressed in SANCs. Cardiac-specific deletion of STIM1 in mice resulted in depletion of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ stores of SANCs and led to SAN dysfunction, as was evident by a reduction in heart rate, sinus arrest, and an exaggerated autonomic response to cholinergic signaling. These studies reveal that STIM1 is a multifunctional regulator of Ca2+ dynamics in SANCs that links SR Ca2+ store content with electrical events occurring in the plasma membrane, thereby contributing to automaticity of the SAN. This work provides insight into the mechanisms that regulate SAN function. (Show more)"

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the largest dinosaurs, the sauropods, had a higher subsoil"
