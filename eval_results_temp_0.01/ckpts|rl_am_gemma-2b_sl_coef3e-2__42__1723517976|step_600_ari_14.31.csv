However, the structure of hydrate formed by a gas with a small atomic radius, such as neon, has not been reported. In this work, we report the structure of neon hydrate at high pressure and temperature. The structure of neon hydrate is different from that of conventional hydrate, which is formed by a gas with a large atomic radius. The structure of neon hydrate is similar to that of ice II, which is formed by a liquid with a small atomic radius. This work provides a new route to study the structure of hydrates formed by a gas with a small atomic radius. It also provides a new route to study the structure of ice II. The structure of neon hydrate can be used to study the structure of ice II. The structure of ice II can be used to study the structure of hydrate formed by a liquid with a small atomic radius.

Although the evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the genomes and transcriptomes of two distantly related myxozoan species and a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results show that the myxozoan body plan was reduced to a minimal structure, and that the genome and gene content were reduced to the lowest levels of any known animal. These results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Show more)"

In this study, we describe a mechanism of viral antagonism in which SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to impair nuclear import of cargo proteins and thereby block the transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes. Our data reveal a previously unknown mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus exploits the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to antagonize the host antiviral response and may lead to the development of new antiviral strategies. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

We use global datasets of maize production and climate variability combined with future temperature projections to quantify how yield variability will change in the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. We find that as the global mean temperature increases, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields increases almost everywhere to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields. For the top four maize-exporting countries, which account for 87% of global maize exports, the probability that they have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes."

However, the extent to which different species partition food resources is largely unknown because species-level identification of food plants is prohibitively difficult with traditional methods. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large herbivores in semiarid African savanna. Our results show that diet composition differs between all species—even pairs of species matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity is sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages, and that large herbivore diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This study highlights the importance of diet composition in determining the extent to which species partition food resources. Understanding the mechanisms of niche partitioning is critical for predicting the consequences of climate change and habitat loss for biodiversity."

The accumulation of plastic debris in the ocean has been widely reported, but the magnitude of the problem is still unclear. We present a global synthesis of the available data on the distribution of floating plastic debris in the ocean. We show that the plastic debris is mostly concentrated in the convergence zones of the five subtropical gyres, but the total load of plastic on the open ocean surface is far less than expected. This discrepancy is explained by the size distribution of the plastic debris, which shows that the millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic are rapidly removed from the surface by a combination of processes yet to be discovered. This sink may be of great importance to understand the fate of the missing plastic debris in the ocean."

The study of presolar grains, which are found in meteorites, provides a unique window into the conditions of nucleosynthesis in stars. We determined the ages of 40 large presolar silicon carbide grains extracted from the Murchison CM2 meteorite. The grains have ages of 3.9 ± 1.6 Ma to ∼3 ± 2 Ga before the start of the Solar System ∼4.6 Ga ago. A majority of the grains have interstellar lifetimes of &lt;300 Ma, which is shorter than theoretical estimates for large grains. This result suggests that the grains condensed in outflows of asymptotic giant branch stars &lt;4.9 Ga ago that possibly formed during an episode of enhanced star formation ∼7 Ga ago. Longer lifetimes are expected for large grains. We estimate that the majority of the grains acquired the bulk of their cosmogenic nuclides in the interstellar medium and not by exposure to an enhanced particle flux of the early active sun.

We demonstrate that high-anxious animals are prone to become subordinate and that this low probability to become dominant is associated with reduced mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens. We further show that nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3, enhances brain energy metabolism and prevents the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals.

IGF2BP1 silencing in human erythroblasts results in a nearly complete reversal of the adult hemoglobin expression pattern toward a more fetal-like phenotype. These results suggest a mechanism for chronoregulation of fetal and adult hemoglobin expression in humans. The findings may have implications for the development of hemoglobinopathies and for the treatment of anemia. They also suggest a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of anemia.

It is regulated by cellular metabolism, redox homeostasis, and various signaling pathways related to cancer. In this study, we found that activating mutation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), highly frequent events in human cancer, confers ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells, and that inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis induction. Mechanistically, this resistance requires sustained activation of mTORC1 and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)C1-dependent induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. Furthermore, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a transcriptional target of SREBP1, mediates the ferroptosis-suppressing activity of SREBP1 by producing monounsaturated fatty acids.

Our analyses resolved previously controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, both major independent origins of specialized herbivory in beetles coincide with the first appearances of an arsenal of PCWDEs encoded in their genomes. Our results suggest that PCWDEs enabled efficient digestion of plant tissues, including lignocellulose in cell walls, facilitating the evolution of uniquely specialized plant-feeding habits, such as leaf mining and stem and wood boring.

It is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis and can spread by multiple transmission pathways. Today, most human plague cases are caused by inhalation of infectious droplets, but the Second Pandemic (14–19th centuries) is characterized by recurrent epidemics, which were likely caused by human ectoparasite vectors. Here, we describe a compartmental model for plague transmission by a human ectoparasite vector. We show that this model fits mortality curves from nine outbreaks in Europe better than models for rodent or pneumonic transmission. Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346–1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats. This study contributes to our understanding of the history of plague and its vectors. It also provides a framework for future studies on the role of human ectoparasites in the spread of plague."

However, the evolution of brain information-processing capacity is not captured by brain size alone. This study shows that, relative to body size, brains of reptiles are smaller but have more neurons, resulting in lower neuronal densities. This pattern is reversed in birds and mammals, which have larger brains relative to body size but have lower neuron numbers. The evolution of brain neuronal density is associated with cognitive ability in birds and primates but not in other mammals. This has important implications for studies using relative brain size as a proxy when looking for evolutionary drivers of animal cognition."

This enzyme recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5′ termini, resulting in a one-nucleotide shift in substrate specificity. The unconventional manner in which RppH recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress.

To overcome this conundrum, we introduce the dual-field-of-view (FOV) high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) for simultaneously profiling aerosol and water cloud properties, especially water cloud microphysical properties. This instrument, verified by the Monte Carlo simulation and coincident observations of other techniques, was used to conduct a case study over Beijing. The observations show that increased aerosol loading led to increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius—consistent with expectations—but had no discernible increase on liquid water path. This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations obtained from the dual-FOV HSRL constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI process. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI."

We here present a method for reconstructing ancient surface temperatures based on the thermostability of ancestral enzymes. Our results suggest that Earth’s surface temperature decreased over geological time from ∼65–80 °C in the Archean, a finding consistent both with previous isotope-based and protein reconstruction-based interpretations.

The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic activation gate and normally shows no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation.

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, in the days (Studies 1 and 2) and months (Studies 3 through 6) following the 2016 American presidential election, women’s and men’s endorsement of hegemonic masculinity predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. The findings highlight the importance of psychological examinations of masculinity as a cultural ideology to understand how men’s and women’s endorsement of hegemonic masculinity legitimizes patriarchal dominance and reinforces gender, race, and class-based hierarchies via candidate support. They also suggest that men’s and women’s endorsement of hegemonic masculinity may be a target for intervention."

However, the management practices that can maximize SOC storage on grassland-derived Mollisols remain uncertain. We show that soil health management practices that increase soil organic matter and microbial biomass, such as incorporating legumes and manure into annual cropping systems, can increase SOC storage in the top 15 cm of soil. However, these practices did not increase mineral-associated SOC, a fraction that is more resistant to decomposition and loss through erosion. Soil health management practices that increase the abundance of soil microbes that decompose crop residues and manure, such as rotational grazing of pastures, can increase mineral-associated SOC and decrease the rate of SOC loss. These results highlight the importance of soil health management practices that increase the abundance of microbes that decompose crop residues and manure in increasing SOC storage on Mollisols.

We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. First, whereas MERS-CoV prefers human DPP4 over bat DPP4 as its receptor, HKU4 shows the opposite trend. Second, in the absence of exogenous proteases, both MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes mediate pseudovirus entry into bat cells, whereas only MERS-CoV spike mediates pseudovirus entry into human cells. Thus, MERS-CoV, but not HKU4, has adapted to use human cells for cross-species transmission. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4.

We found that the human pol δ holoenzyme is more stable than its S. cerevisiae counterpart and maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on lagging strand synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion.

The parchment used to make these books was a major innovation in the history of book production. The source of this parchment, often called “uterine vellum,” has been a long-standing controversy in codicology. Here, we report a simple and objective method to identify the animal origin of parchment. The method is based on the use of a PVC eraser to extract protein from the parchment surface, followed by analysis of the extracted proteins by mass spectrometry. The method is noninvasive and can be used to identify the animal origin of parchment from a single manuscript. The results suggest that the production of tissue-thin parchment did not necessarily require the use of abortive or newborn animals."

The cause of the extinction is still debated, but the timing of the extinction and the rapid recovery of biodiversity are well constrained by the stratigraphy of the Global Stratotype Section and Point for the Permian-Triassic boundary. The age model for the extinction is based on U-Pb dates of detrital zircon from five volcanic ash beds. The age model is refined by the identification of a carbon cycle perturbation that occurred at the time of the extinction. The carbon cycle perturbation is followed by a rapid recovery of the carbon cycle, but the link between the carbon cycle and the extinction is not yet resolved. The timing of the carbon cycle perturbation and the recovery of the carbon cycle are important for evaluating the plausibility of trigger and kill hypotheses. The age model for the extinction is the basis for a refined evaluation of the extinction and recovery dynamics."

RORαΔIEC mice exhibit excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs.

In this paper, we calculate, as a function of pressure, two central chemical properties of atoms, chemical hardness and electronegativity, which can be seen as the first- and second-order chemical potentials. We find that for most elements, chemical hardness and electronegativity decrease with pressure, consistent with pressure-induced metallization. Furthermore, we discover that pressure-induced s-d orbital transfer makes Ni, Pd, and Pt “pseudo–noble-gas” atoms with a closed d-shell configuration, and the elements preceding them (Fe and, especially, Co, Rh, and Ir) electron acceptors, while the elements right after them (Cu, Ag, Zn, and Cd) become highly electropositive.

We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML.

We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA.

The discovery of quasicrystals in meteorites and in the laboratory has led to a revolution in our understanding of the structure of solids. Here, we report the discovery of a hitherto unknown composition of icosahedral quasicrystal in a sample of red trinitite, the first test explosion of a nuclear bomb. The discovery of this new quasicrystal, Si61Cu30Ca7Fe2, provides a link between the discovery of quasicrystals in the laboratory and in meteorites and the discovery of quasicrystals in the environment. This discovery also demonstrates that quasicrystals can be discovered in the environment and that transient extreme pressure–temperature conditions are suitable for the synthesis of quasicrystals. This discovery has implications for the search for new quasicrystal-forming systems and for the search for extraterrestrial quasicrystals."

Neuroinflammation is also known to be associated with autoimmune diseases, such as EAE. Neuroinflammation is a complex process that involves multiple cell types, including microglia, astrocytes, and neurons. In this study, we found that neuroinflammation was reduced in both the early and later stages of EAE in microglia/macrophage-specific ASK1 knockout mice, whereas only the later-stage neuroinflammation was ameliorated in astrocyte-specific ASK1 knockout mice. We also found that ASK1 signaling in microglia played a major role in generating and maintaining disease. Activated astrocytes produce key inflammatory mediators, including CCL2, that further activated and recruited microglia/macrophages, in an astrocytic ASK1-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that glial ASK1 is a promising therapeutic target for reducing neuroinflammation. This study provides insights into the roles of ASK1 in the pathogenesis of EAE. These findings may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of EAE. (Show more)"

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. Our study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility in autism and suggests that the activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting is a potential therapeutic target for autism. This study also provides a model system to study the role of forgetting in learning and memory. (Show more)"

These aggregates are internalized and accumulate within other neurons, causing non–cell-autonomous pathology.

Rather, the inclusion bodies in ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis remain unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated the impact of O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (EtdT) lesions on the transcriptional fidelity of RNA polymerase II. We found that the three regioisomeric EtdT lesions can induce distinct transcriptional stalling profiles and that the transcriptional lesion bypass routes are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The results from this study provide important mechanistic insights into transcriptional stalling, lesion bypass, and mutagenesis of alkylated DNA lesions. This work also provides a comprehensive understanding of the impact of DNA alkylation on transcriptional fidelity. These findings will facilitate the development of DNA repair and mutagenesis assays for the study of DNA alkylation-induced mutagenesis.

To better understand how sequential proteolysis contributes to MERS-CoV infection, we introduced mutations that blocked the first cleavages of MERS-CoV spike (S) glycoproteins. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted conformational changes induced by cell receptors, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence. These findings may help to explain why MERS-CoV causes severe pneumonia in humans, but not in other cell types."

We show that a series of massive volcanic eruptions, coincident with the onset of deglaciation, plausibly led to stratospheric ozone depletion, which in turn caused a change in Southern Hemisphere climate. This finding provides a unique link between the timing of deglaciation and the stratosphere, and it has important implications for our understanding of the timing and causes of the last deglaciation. It also has implications for the timing of the next deglaciation. (The full version is in the PNAS journal archives.)"

In contrast, in Parkinson’s disease, this dominant network was subordinated to an independent disease-related pattern. Network functionality was assessed by quantifying metabolic activity in the dominant network during task performance.

Fibrous sheath interacting protein 1 (FSIP1) is a cancer antigen expressed in the majority of TNBC tissues and is associated with poor prognosis. However, the role of FSIP1 in the progression and drug sensitivity of TNBC has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. (Show more)"

We found that changes in temperature systematically altered the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures departed from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increased, meaning that more species were required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function.

However, the relative importance of small streams in driving coastal nutrient loads has not been quantified. We used a snapshot of nutrient inputs from nearly all tributaries of Lake Michigan to determine how land cover and dams alter nutrient inputs across watershed sizes. We found that the 6 largest of 235 tributaries accounted for ∼70% of the daily N and P delivered to Lake Michigan. However, small tributaries exhibited nutrient loads that were high for their size and biased toward dissolved inorganic forms. Our findings reveal an underappreciated role that small streams may play in driving coastal eutrophication in large water bodies. Expanding nutrient management efforts to address smaller watersheds could reduce the ecological impacts of nutrient loading on valuable nearshore ecosystems. This approach could be applied to other large water bodies, such as the Gulf of Mexico, to reduce the overall nutrient loads that threaten the health of coastal ecosystems."

We find that the long-time dynamics of such systems are biased toward states that exhibit a fine-tuned extremization of environmental forcing. This behavior is reminiscent of the “saddle-node” bifurcation, which is a well-known phenomenon in dynamical systems. We also find that the dynamics of the network are sensitive to the details of the environment, and that the system can exhibit a variety of behaviors, including a “saddle-node” bifurcation, depending on the details of the environment. This sensitivity to the environment is a hallmark of complex systems."

Here we show that NMDAR-Ab–related changes in cortical microcircuitry render the brain susceptible to paroxysmal EEG abnormalities. We use a dynamic model of the cortical microcircuit to explain the effects of NMDAR-Ab on EEG and to identify the key synaptic parameters that best explain EEG paroxysms in pediatric patients with NMDAR-Ab encephalitis. Finally, we show that the same parameter fluctuations are tolerated in the in silico model of the control condition, but only when the cortical microcircuit is critically susceptible to overt EEG paroxysms. These findings offer mechanistic insights into circuit-level dysfunction induced by NMDAR-Ab. They also provide a framework for understanding the effects of other neuropsychiatric disorders on EEG. This framework may be useful for the development of new treatments for these disorders. (Show more)"

However, the impact of this increase on the Earth system is not well understood. Here, we present a case study of a rapid global warming event that occurred during a previous period of rapid CO2 increase. We show that the warming was associated with a doubling of atmospheric CO2 and a biodiversity nadir. We also show that the warming was linked to an increase in nutrient fluxes and that the warming was driven by enhanced thermocline stratification. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the Earth system response to rapid CO2 increase in order to understand the impact of anthropogenic CO2 emissions on the system. This will require a better understanding of the Earth system response to abrupt warming events."

The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) is the leading certification scheme for palm oil, and many major corporations and countries have made commitments to purchase or produce only “sustainable” palm oil. We show that certification reduces deforestation in oil palm plantations, but that most plantations are too small to have a significant impact on deforestation. Certification also reduces active fire detection rates, but not forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Certification has no causal impact on deforestation in forests. These findings suggest that certification is not yet having the desired impact on deforestation in Indonesia."

In humans, its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. The small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 (exocyst component of 70 kDa) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

In vertebrates, sex is determined by a single genetic locus, which can be either male- or female-determining. In species with a single sex-determining locus, the sex of an individual is determined by the sex of its parents, and the sex of an individual is either male or female. In species with multiple sex-determining alleles, the sex of an individual can be male, female, or intersex, and the sex of an individual can be male or female depending on the sex of its parents. Here we investigate the effects of multiple sex-determining alleles on the evolution of secondary sexual characteristics. We find that multiple sex-determining alleles can produce modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics, and that the modularity of secondary sexual characteristics can be used to understand the evolutionary causes and consequences of the maintenance, gain, or loss of sex-determining alleles."

We sought to understand how Fe levels impact the retina, given that RPE cells are also challenged by accumulations of bisretinoids. We found that Fe levels in the retina are elevated in a mouse model of age-related macular degeneration, and that Fe levels promote the oxidation and degradation of the bisretinoid A2E. These findings suggest that Fe levels may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration. This interpretation was supported by experiments showing that Fe chelation decreased the oxidative/degradation of A2E in the presence of light and reduced cell death in cell-based experiments. Moreover, light-independent oxidation and degradation of A2E by Fenton chemistry products were evidenced by the consumption of A2E, release of dicarbonyls, and generation of oxidized A2E species in cell-free assays. These findings may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration. (Show more)"

In this study, we analyze the evolution of the feeding strategies of siphonophores, a group of pelagic cnidarians that use specialized tentacle structures armed with nematocysts for prey capture. We show that siphonophore specialization is not a dead end, and that the evolution of morphological innovations can lead to the diversification of feeding strategies. Our findings contribute to understanding the evolution of predator specialization and morphological innovation, and help us to understand how the structure of food webs has changed over time."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants."
