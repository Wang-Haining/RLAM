The most promising approach, initiated by von Neumann, is to reconstruct quantum mechanics from a few basic axioms. The most important of these axioms is that the set of density operators forms a convex set. This axiom is controversial, and there are several different ways to formulate it. We show that the controversy is due to different choices of mathematical language. We provide axioms for a category that is equivalent to the category of continuous linear operators between Hilbert spaces, and show that the set of density operators is a convex set in this category."

The evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, and a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we compare the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme, and show that the transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. Our results provide insights into the molecular basis of the extreme reduction in gene content and function that is characteristic of the Myxozoa. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1, but the molecular mechanism of this inhibition is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide"

A Threonine to Alanine substitution at this position was studied in three representative members of the K+-channel family. Interestingly, all of the mutant channels exhibited lack of C-type inactivation gating and an inversion of their allosteric coupling (i.e., closing of the activation gate collapses the channel’s selectivity filter). A state-dependent crystallographic study of KcsA-T75A proves that, on activation, the selectivity filter transitions from a nonconductive and deep C-type inactivated conformation to a conductive one.

High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low-anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as decreased ATP and increased ROS production in the nucleus accumbens.

The synthesized structures exhibit organic shapes and motions with irregular distributions of material phases. Within the structures, different materials play distinct roles yet seamlessly collaborate through sophisticated deformation mechanisms to produce the target behaviors.

We show that the NWFP halted the decline of bird populations associated with early-seral forests, but not older forests. This is partly due to the fact that older forests are declining, and the NWFP has not yet been able to halt this decline. We also show that the NWFP has not been effective in halting the decline of older-forest–associated bird populations. Our results highlight the need to continue to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and to ensure that the creation of early-seral forests does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure."

The development of new antibiotics is a major challenge, and computational approaches are essential tools to this end. In this study, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. The results of this study provide a proof of concept for the rational design of new antibiotics. This approach can be extended to other antibiotic classes. The design strategy presented here can be used to develop new antibiotics against a broad range of pathogens."

We used a comprehensive dataset to resolve the evolutionary history of beetles, including the origins of plant feeding, and to trace the evolution of genes enabling symbiont-independent digestion of lignocellulose. Phylogenomic analyses of these uniquely comprehensive datasets resolved previously controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, both major independent origins of specialized herbivory in beetles coincide with the first appearances of an arsenal of PCWDEs encoded in their genomes. Beetle diversity thus appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding PCWDEs.

Here, we report a novel role for APOE in regulating the rate of astrocytic phagocytosis of synapses, which is highly dependent on APOE isoform. We also found that APOE alleles affect the rate of C1q accumulation in the hippocampus, which may represent the accumulation of senescent synapses with enhanced vulnerability to complement-mediated neurodegeneration. These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of astrocytic phagocytosis. They also suggest the hypothesis that AD susceptibility of APOE4 may originate in part from defective phagocytic capacity of astrocytes which accelerates the rate of accumulation of C1q-coated senescent synapses, enhancing synaptic vulnerability to classical-complement-cascade mediated neurodegeneration. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that APOE4 is associated with a higher rate of neurodegeneration in AD patients."

The temperature of the early Earth has been estimated using a variety of methods, but the results have been inconsistent. We used the thermostability of ancestral enzymes to estimate the temperature of the surface environment of ancient organisms. Our results suggest that the temperature of the early Earth decreased over time. This finding is consistent with other methods of estimating the temperature of the early Earth and provides a new method for estimating the temperature of the early Earth."

They are also the main targets of drugs. Ion channels are classified into three types based on their structure and function. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel is a type-3 channel that is normally open and inactivated by slow C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s C-inactivation is state-dependent, and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. We propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. This study provides a new perspective on the regulation of ion channels.

The parasite, Plasmodium, uses a number of mechanisms to facilitate invasion of the red blood cell (RBC), the host cell in which it replicates. Here, we show that one of these mechanisms is the binding of a parasite protein to a receptor on the RBC surface. We show that this binding leads to a change in the physical properties of the RBC, which is required for invasion. This finding has implications for the development of new antimalarial drugs, as it suggests that the physical properties of the RBC are a critical target for drug action. It also has implications for the development of new strategies to prevent malaria, as it suggests that the physical properties of the RBC could be targeted to reduce the risk of infection.

We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

These results provide a mechanistic explanation for the unique properties of Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans. They also provide a rationale for the use of PCNA inhibitors in cancer therapy."

In the RNA world, before the evolution of proteins, genetic information was stored in RNA. In vitro evolution of RNA molecules has led to the discovery of many important RNA structures, but the ability to synthesize functional RNA molecules from an RNA template has not been demonstrated. Here, we report the development of an RNA polymerase ribozyme that can synthesize a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and, in low yield, even tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins. This work provides a foundation for the study of the origins of life and the evolution of RNA-based life."

We introduce a method to identify topics in a corpus and represent documents as topic sequences. This method is based on advances in theoretical machine learning, which have led to the development of a sparse representation of an embedding space. We can infer the topic that generated a sequence of words, and we can also identify the gender bias of our topics. Our method offers a flexible and broadly applicable approach to model topics in text data. We illustrate its application to a prominent example of underutilized text: the US National Violent Death Reporting System."

We show here that monoclonal antibodies targeting the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility, which resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

The band structures of the photonic crystals are predicted to produce unconventional atom–light interaction behaviors, including anisotropic emission, suppressed spontaneous decay, and photon-mediated atom–atom interactions controlled by the position of the atomic array relative to the photonic crystal. The device configuration also enables application of optical tweezers for controlled placement of atoms. Devices can be fabricated reliably from a 200-nm silicon nitride device layer using a lithography-based process, producing predicted optical properties in transmission and reflection measurements. These 2D photonic crystal devices can be readily deployed to experiments for many-body physics with neutral atoms and engineering of exotic quantum matter. The photonic crystals can be used to control the properties of the atoms, and the atoms can be used to control the properties of the photonic crystals. This is a new way to control the properties of matter."

However, the economic and ecological costs of wildfire have risen substantially in recent decades. Climate change has likely contributed to the increase in wildfire activity, but the direct role of people in increasing wildfire activity has been largely overlooked. We show that humans have vastly expanded the spatial and seasonal “fire niche” in the United States, accounting for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. Human-caused wildfires disproportionally occurred where fuel moisture was higher than lightning-started fires, thereby helping expand the geographic and seasonal niche of wildfire. Actions to raise awareness and increase management in regions prone to human-started wildfires should be a focus of United States policy to reduce fire risk and associated hazards."

Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function.

Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners.

However, the role of Si in plant resistance against insect herbivores has not been explored. In this study, we show that Si pretreatment of rice plants increased resistance against the rice leaffolder, a major insect pest of rice, and that this effect was associated with an increase in silicon accumulation and enhanced jasmonate (JA) biosynthesis and signaling. These results suggest that Si may promote insect herbivore resistance by priming JA-mediated defense responses. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the interaction between silicon and jasmonate in plant defense, which may lead to the development of new strategies for insect pest control.

The activity of this enzyme is modulated by the availability of tetrahydrobiopterin, which is a cofactor for the synthesis of the glycerophospholipids. This study reveals a new regulatory mechanism of the lipidome of macrophages and opens the way for further studies on the role of this enzyme in the function of macrophages."

We show that the size, shape, compactness, stiffness, and attachment location of the DNA nanostructures are important design parameters for the delivery of molecules to the interior of plants. This work establishes the feasibility of DNA nanostructures for the delivery of molecules to plants and also details the design parameters of importance for plant cell internalization and also assesses the impact of DNA nanostructure geometry for gene silencing mechanisms.

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants."
