This finding has important implications for the structure of ice II. It also provides a new route to study the structure of ice II at high pressure and temperature.

In this paper, we provide a purely categorical approach to the foundations of quantum theory. The axioms are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. This addresses a question about the mathematical foundations of quantum theory raised in reconstruction programs such as those of von Neumann, Mackey, Jauch, Piron, Abramsky, and Coecke. Our approach is based on the observation that the category of Hilbert spaces and bounded operators is equivalent to the category of continuous linear functions between Hilbert spaces. This equivalence is a special case of a general result about the structure of the category of vector spaces over a field. Our approach is thus a step toward a mathematical foundation of quantum theory that is independent of any specific mathematical structure. We believe that this is an important step forward in the search for a mathematical foundation of quantum theory."

The evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, but a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species and a cnidarian species. Our results show that the myxozoan body plan is reduced to the essential elements for survival as parasites. This study provides insight into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Show more)"

The virus responsible for this disease, SARS-CoV-2, is able to evade the antiviral action of the immune system by blocking the nuclear import of key transcription factors that are essential for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). In this study, we show that the accessory protein Orf6 of SARS-CoV-2 is able to block nuclear import of STAT1 and STAT2. We further show that this function is mediated by a direct interaction of Orf6 with the Nup98-Rae1 complex, which is essential for nuclear import of ISGs. Our findings provide a mechanism of viral antagonism that could be used by SARS-CoV-2 to escape the antiviral action of the immune system. This mechanism could be used as a target for the development of antiviral therapies. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. Sperm cells are quiescent in the male reproductive system due to Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1 channels, but become active once introduced into the low-Zn2+-concentration environment of the female reproductive tract. How Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide"

We find that the probability of simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero for the top four maize-exporting countries, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming. Our results underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa in the field. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammal species in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammal assemblages, and that large mammal diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.

However, the global load of plastic on the open ocean surface was estimated to be on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This discrepancy is explained by the size distribution of the debris, which points at important size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

In this study, we found that the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis protects cancer cells from ferroptosis through induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. This resistance to ferroptosis requires sustained activation of mTORC1 and the induction of SREBP1. In contrast, mTORC1 inhibition sensitized cancer cells to ferroptosis, and this sensitivity was abrogated by genetic or pharmacological ablation of SREBP1 or its target fatty acid desaturase-1.

TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. Thus, TRAP1 may be a promising target for cancer therapy. However, the molecular mechanisms by which TRAP1 regulates metabolism and invasiveness in normal cells remain to be determined. Elucidation of these mechanisms will be critical for the rational design of"

They are dynamic structures that are constantly being assembled and disassembled. The actin depolymerizing factor (ADF) family of proteins is the major regulator of actin filament disassembly. However, how it does so remains unclear. Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to study the action of ADF/cofilin in different mechanical situations. We find that ADF/cofilin enhances severing of filaments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist. A simple model, which faithfully recapitulates our experimental observations, indicates that the ADF/cofilin-induced twist enhances severing by 100-fold. We propose that this mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. Our findings have implications for understanding the role of ADF/cofilin in cells. They also provide a general framework for understanding the action of other proteins that are mechanosensitive. Finally, they suggest that the action of ADF/cofilin is fundamentally different from that of other ADF-related proteins."

However, the cellular response to stress is often accompanied by the generation of reactive oxygen species, which can inactivate the predominant Np4 decapping enzyme. Here, we show that, in the presence of such stress, a second enzyme, RppH, is activated and takes over the role of decapping Np4-capped RNAs. This enzyme has a unique mechanism for recognizing 5′ termini, which is distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5′ termini. This unconventional mechanism for recognizing capped 5′ ends could have major consequences for the reprogramming of gene expression during stress.

Mutations in VWF cause the common bleeding disorder, von Willebrand disease (VWD). We report that force application to platelets switches the A1 domain of VWF to a second state with faster on-rate, providing a mechanism for activating VWF binding to platelets. This mechanism is critical for the pathophysiology of VWD. The conversion of single molecule kon (s−1) to bulk phase kon (s−1M−1) and the kon and koff values extrapolated to zero force for the low-force pathways show remarkably good agreement with bulk-phase measurements. This suggests that the force-switched state is a thermodynamically stable state. The results provide a mechanism for understanding the effects of mutations in VWF. They also provide a platform for studying the effects of force on other proteins. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

It is also involved in the regulation of blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac contractility. The BK channel is unique in that it lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally shows no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Our findings provide a new perspective on the regulation of the BK channel. They also provide a theoretical framework for the study of other K+ channels.

In temperate regions, seasonal outbreaks of influenza virus are associated with decreases in ambient humidity. However, the impact of humidity on host defense against influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that mice housed in low humidity are more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide insights into the impact of dry air on host defense against influenza virus infection and disease outcome. They also suggest that dry air may be a modifiable risk factor for seasonal influenza epidemics. Our study may also be relevant to the impact of dry air on other respiratory viral infections.

This activity is distributed across multiple regions of the language network, including the superior temporal and inferior frontal cortices. The results are consistent with a neural implementation of a bottom-up or left-corner parser of the incoming language stream.

We show that the two forms of Axin in vertebrates are similar at the protein level and genetically redundant. We show that differential regulation of the two genes on the transcriptional and proteostatic level confers differential responsiveness that can be used in tissue-specific regulation. Such subtle features may distinguish other redundant gene pairs that are commonly found in vertebrates through gene knockout experiments.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions. Our findings provide insights into the origins and evolution of MERS-CoV and its potential for future human outbreaks. They also provide a basis for the development of vaccines and"

The carbon cycle reorganization that preceded the extinction is punctuated by a sharp negative spike in the isotopic composition of carbonate carbon. The carbon cycle volatility that persisted for ∼500 ka before a return to near preextinction values is consistent with the hypothesis that the extinction was triggered by a global environmental perturbation.

The Black and Latino populations are estimated to experience declines of 2.10 and 3.05 y, respectively. These projections imply an increase of nearly 40% in the Black−White life expectancy gap, from 3.6 y to over 5 y, thereby eliminating progress made in reducing this differential since 2006.

We provide evidence for repeated climate-driven reintroductions of the bacterium into European harbors from reservoirs in Asia, with a delay of 15 ± 1 y. Our analysis finds no support for the existence of permanent plague reservoirs in medieval Europe. Instead, we find that the introduction of plague into Europe was a recurrent event, with a delay of 15 y, which is consistent with the existence of a trans-Eurasian trade network. This trade network is likely to have been the result of the Silk Road system, which was in operation during the second plague pandemic.

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

We show that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner. Our findings suggest that the evolutionary rates of plastid genes reach several new rate equilibria during the process of functional reduction. These equilibria are linked to the modified protein turnover rates in heterotrophic plastids.

We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

These proteins aggregate and spread throughout the brain, causing damage to neurons. The mechanisms that underlie this spreading are not well understood. Here we use a fluorescently tagged polyglutamine-expanded form of human huntingtin to study the spreading of aggregates in a Drosophila model of Huntington’s disease. We show that aggregates accumulate at synaptic terminals and spread throughout the brain. We also show that aggregates cause non–cell-autonomous pathology, including loss of vulnerable neurons. Finally, we show that the release of aggregates requires fusion protein 1, demonstrating that active release and uptake of aggregates are important elements of spreading and disease progression.

However, the factors that contribute to virus spillover from bats are not well understood. Here, we identified and characterized a protein (MTX) that is highly concentrated in the submandibular salivary gland of the bat, Myotis pilosus. MTX inhibits the antiviral immune response of the host and facilitates viral infection by selectively inhibiting the epoxide hydrolase function of leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) to inhibit LTA4 hydrolysis and the generation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a potent lipid chemoattractant for host defense against infection. This study provides deeper insight into immunologically privileged sites for microbial community residence in bats and supports the therapeutic potential of targeting MTX-LTA4H. Our findings may help to elucidate the mechanisms of virus spillover from bats and provide a deeper understanding of the role of bats in the emergence of zoonotic diseases.

The disease is caused by mutations in a number of proteins, including superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), TDP-43, and Fused in Sarcoma (FUS). These proteins are highly aggregation-prone and form inclusions in the brains of patients with ALS. Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions in ALS are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. Rather, the inclusions are populated by proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. Our results suggest that the inclusions in ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. This is a significant finding, as it suggests that the inclusions in ALS are a direct consequence of the disease process, rather than being a result of the presence of a single protein. This may have implications for the design of therapeutic strategies for ALS. (Show more)"

To understand the mechanisms of MERS-CoV infection, we engineered MERS viruses with mutations that blocked sequential proteolysis. These mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence. These findings may also be relevant to other coronaviruses. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Here, we show that ets variant 2 (ETV2) is sufficient to induce EC development from human adult skin fibroblasts. ETV2-induced EC development is accompanied by the expression of multiple endothelial development factors, including FLI1, ERG, and TAL1. ETV2-induced EC development also results in the formation of mature functional vasculature in Matrigel plugs transplanted in mice. Our study provides a potential strategy for the generation of ECs for the treatment of vascular disorders. This study also provides a better understanding of the mechanism of human EC development.

Recently, two ligands, ALKAL1 and ALKAL2 (also named “augmentor-β” and “augmentor-α” or “FAM150A” and “FAM150B,” respectively) were discovered. Here, we show that these ligands play an important role in zebrafish pigment development. We demonstrate that augmentor ligands are essential for zebrafish iridophore differentiation and that they are activated by Ltk and not by Alk. These experiments establish a physiological link between augmentor ligands and Ltk and demonstrate that particular augmentors activate Ltk in a tissue-specific context to induce iridophore differentiation from neural crest-derived cells and pigment progenitor cells. This study provides a better understanding of the function of these orphan RTKs and their ligands in vivo. It also provides a model system for the study of the function of these ligands in other organisms. This study may lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets for cancer and other diseases.

Herein, we show that STING is required for normal β-cell function and is decreased in islets of T2D mice and patients. Moreover, we found that STING deficiency impairs glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, suggesting a possible role of STING in β-cell dysfunction. These findings establish a pathophysiological significance of fine-tuned STING within β-cells and insulin target tissues for maintaining glucose homeostasis.

They cause annual epidemics and occasionally severe pandemics. The viral genome is segmented into eight RNA fragments, which offers evolutionary advantages but complicates genomic packaging. The existence of a selective packaging mechanism, in which one copy of each viral RNA is specifically packaged into each virion, is suspected, but its molecular details remain unknown. Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus. We demonstrated that this interaction takes place in infected cells and is required for optimal viral replication. Disruption of this interaction decreased the amount of viral RNA in the viral particles, resulting in an eightfold increase in empty viral particles. This interaction is not widely conserved among influenza A viruses. Our experiments indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions. The lack of conservation of these interactions might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses. This study provides a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of influenza A virus replication. It also provides a basis for the development of new antiviral strategies. (Show more)"

Moreover, the composition and activity of the gut microbiota are altered in these subjects. These results suggest that the gut microbiota is involved in the development of alcohol dependence. Thus, the gut microbiota seems to be a previously unidentified target in the management of alcohol dependence. This study also shows that the gut barrier and the microbiota are linked to psychological symptoms of alcohol dependence. This may be important in the development of relapse. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc."

This gene encodes a flavin-dependent monooxygenase that catalyzes sequential hydroxylations of a single precursor. This work provides a major step forward in understanding the biosynthesis of tomato flavor. It also provides a model for the study of the biosynthesis of other classes of nitrogenous flavor compounds. (Show more)"

The SAN is composed of specialized cardiomyocytes, which are responsible for generating the heart rate. SAN cells (SANCs) are able to adjust heart rate to meet hemodynamic demand. Here, we report that stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and Orai1 channels, key components of store-operated Ca2+ entry, are selectively expressed in SANCs. Cardiac-specific deletion of STIM1 in mice resulted in depletion of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ stores of SANCs and led to SAN dysfunction, as was evident by a reduction in heart rate, sinus arrest, and an exaggerated autonomic response to cholinergic signaling. Moreover, STIM1 influenced SAN function by regulating ionic fluxes in SANCs, including activation of a store-operated Ca2+ current, a reduction in L-type Ca2+ current, and enhancing the activities of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. In conclusion, these studies reveal that STIM1 is a multifunctional regulator of Ca2+ dynamics in SANCs that links SR Ca2+ store content with electrical events occurring in"

However, little attention is paid to the role of natural landscapes such as forests in meeting nutrition goals. This study shows that deforestation can reduce people’s consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are important sources of vitamins. Conversely, forest fragmentation can increase people’s consumption of fruits and vegetables, which is a positive development. The results have important implications for policy makers, who should consider the role of forests in meeting both food and nutrition goals. This study also has implications for researchers, who should consider the role of natural landscapes in meeting nutrition goals. Finally, the study has implications for practitioners, who should consider the role of natural landscapes in meeting nutrition goals. This study provides a causal link between deforestation and people’s dietary quality, and the results have important implications for policy makers, researchers, practitioners, and the general public."

However, it has come at a cost of soil degradation, with the risk of subsoil compaction becoming a major concern. We show that the risk of subsoil compaction has increased over the course of modern mechanization, with the risk of compaction now exceeding the safe mechanical limits for soil functioning. This alarming trend calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis needs to be tested in the field. (Show more)"
