However, the structure of ice II with a guest molecule dissolved in it has not been resolved. Here, we report the structure of ice II with neon dissolved in it at 480 MPa and 260 K. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The structure is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. This work provides a unique insight into the structure of ice II and the properties of the guest–host system. It also provides a reference for the study of the structure of ice II at other pressures and temperatures. This work is expected to be useful for the development of new materials and the understanding of the properties of the guest–host system."

The evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, but a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we present the first genomic and transcriptomic analyses of two distantly related myxozoan species, Kudoa iwatai and Myxobolus cerebralis, and compare these to the transcriptome and genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results provide insight into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. They also suggest that the Myxozoa are a sister group to the cnidarians."

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to block the nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are essential for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We found that the viral accessory protein Orf6 is responsible for this activity and that it does so by interfering with the nuclear import of ISGs. Our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the host immune response and may help in the development of new antiviral strategies. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1, but the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species in semiarid African savanna. We found that, despite being similar in body size and proportional grass consumption, these species differed in diet composition, and that dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our approach provides a powerful tool for quantifying diet in large herbivores, and for understanding the role of niche partitioning in structuring herbivore assemblages.

However, the global load of floating plastic debris is still unknown. We show that the global load of floating plastic debris is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This discrepancy is explained by the selective removal of the millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic by a combination of processes, such as nano-fragmentation, transference to the ocean interior, and ballasting. This study highlights the importance of size-selective sinks in the fate of floating plastic debris and the need for a better understanding of the global distribution of the different size fractions of floating plastic debris. This will be crucial to assess the magnitude of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

The development of new antibiotics is a long and expensive process, which is often unsuccessful. Here, we present a computational approach to accelerate the discovery of new antibiotics. We used a computational model to predict the solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity of acylide antibiotics toward the ribosome. We then tested the predicted best candidates in vitro and in vivo. The best candidate is synthetically more accessible, exhibits higher solubility and binding affinity to the ribosome, and is up to 56 times more active against resistant pathogens than telithromycin. Notably, the best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. Our approach can be used to accelerate the discovery of new antibiotics and to reduce the risk of failure in the drug development process. This article is protected by copyright.

Results show evidence for 24 lake level drops of more than 200 m during the Late Quaternary, including 15 lowstands when water levels were more than 400 m lower than modern. A dramatic shift is observed at the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT), consistent with far-field climate forcing, which separates vastly different hydroclimate regimes before and after ∼800,000 years ago. We also observe that periods of high lake level are observed during times of high eccentricity.

This finding would suggest that the parasite and host cell are working together to facilitate invasion, rather than the parasite acting alone. This would have major implications for the development of antimalarial drugs."

These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. HM was associated with less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia, but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors.

To understand how HKU4 and HKU5 transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions.

We used a grid-based approach to sample the genomic diversity across the island, and we found that Madagascar is a mosaic of African and Asian ancestry, with a recent settlement of the island. The settlement history is also reflected in the distribution of the ancestry across the island, showing that the settlement happened independently from Africa and Asia. This study shows that Madagascar is a unique case, with a unique history, and that the island is not a “natural laboratory” for the study of human evolution. Instead, it is a unique laboratory for the study of the history of Madagascar."

We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA."

We show that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner. Our findings suggest that the evolutionary rates of plastid genes are linked to the extent of functional reduction and the establishment of the obligate parasitic lifestyle.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners.

Here, we present a study of an abrupt climate change event that occurred during a glacial period. We show that this event was accompanied by a doubling of atmospheric CO2 and a biodiversity nadir. We also show that this event was linked to an increase in the amount of organic matter entering the ocean and to an increase in the amount of nutrients reaching the surface ocean. These results provide insights into the mechanisms that can lead to abrupt climate change and highlight the importance of organic matter in the Earth system. View Full-Text"

Certification is the main tool used to meet these commitments, and around 20% of global palm oil production is certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. We show that certification is associated with reduced deforestation in Indonesia, but that the impact is small and limited to areas that are already degraded. Certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation."

In humans, its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. In this study, we discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and offers a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

In this study, we investigate the effects of multiple interacting sex determination alleles on secondary sexual characteristics in a species with four possible sex classes. We find that the interplay of sex determination alleles in M. mbenjii produces modular variation in morphological and behavioral traits, and that the evolution or introgression of a newly acquired sex determiner creates additional axes of variation for varied traits. These results highlight the potential for polygenic sex determination to produce a wide range of sexual phenotypes, and the evolutionary consequences of such variation. (Show more)"

These species are generated by the metabolism of vitamin A and can damage the retina. We show that the presence of iron in the retina can promote the oxidation and degradation of these species. This finding has implications for the retina in health and disease.

However, the evolution of specialization is often considered a dead end, as it is associated with the loss of morphological and functional optimizations. Here we show that specialization can be maintained and even enhanced by the evolution of morphological innovations, and that specialization can be shifted to other prey types. These findings help understand the evolution of specialization in predators, and the role of morphological evolution in the diversification of food webs."

The study of the hand is complicated by the fact that the hand is the most mobile part of the body and, therefore, the most difficult to preserve. However, the study of the hand is important because it provides insight into the evolution of the human brain and the evolution of intelligence. This study provides the earliest evidence for the evolution of a key derived feature of the human hand, the third metacarpal styloid process."

We show that the weight of farm machinery has increased by a factor of 10 since the 1950s, and that the weight of harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods. We hypothesize that the roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants."
