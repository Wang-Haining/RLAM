Here, we provide the first genomic and transcriptomic data for two species of myxozoans, which allowed us to compare the genome and transcriptome of a parasitic cnidarian to that of a parasitic noncnidarian. Our results show that the myxozoan body plan is reduced to the bare minimum, with a genome size that is one of the smallest among animals. This reduction is accompanied by a reduction in gene content and expression of genes involved in development and cell–cell communication. Our results provide insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic cnidarian. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 uses a previously unknown mechanism to block nuclear import of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex. Our results reveal a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels."

This instability in global grain trade and international grain prices will affect especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. We also show that, under 2 °C of global warming, the optimum growing temperature will be exceeded in most of the world’s major maize-producing countries, and that the optimum growing temperature will be exceeded in all of them under 4 °C of global warming.

Dietary overlap was also greater between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption than between species that were similar in body size and proportional browse consumption. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammal assemblages, and that large mammal diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This may have important implications for the management of large mammal populations and the conservation of savanna ecosystems. (Show more)"

The development of new antibiotics is a major challenge for the scientific community. In this work, we present a rational design approach to develop new antibiotics. The approach is based on the prediction of the physicochemical properties of the compounds, which are then tested in vitro and in vivo. The best compounds are then tested for their activity against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. The results show that the best compounds designed by us are active against antibiotic-resistant pathogens, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin. The approach presented here can be used to develop new antibiotics against other antibiotic-resistant pathogens. (Show more)"

We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data.

We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor.

We find that ADF/cofilin binds to the barbed end of the filament and that this binding is enhanced by local curvature. Surprisingly, we find that tension has no effect on ADF/cofilin binding, but that tension enhances severing. We propose that the enhanced severing is due to the ADF/cofilin-induced filament twist.

We found that the Malagasy population is a mixture of Bantu and Austronesian populations, with a limited contribution from Europe and the Middle East. The distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. This study provides a comprehensive view of the genomic diversity of Madagascar. It is a unique resource for the scientific community. It will be used to study the human history of Madagascar and the Indian Ocean. It will also be used to study the human history of Africa and Southeast Asia. (Show more)"

Our results suggest that people are influenced by the emotions of others, even when they are not interacting with them in person. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others’ positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.

One of the most common modifications in coding regions of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) is pseudouridine (Ψ), which is present in 10–20% of uridine nucleotides. We show that the presence of Ψ in an mRNA codon can impede the activation of the elongation factor EF-Tu and the addition of amino acids to the growing peptide chain. We also find that the presence of Ψ can promote the synthesis of multiple peptide products from a single mRNA sequence in the cell. These findings suggest that the presence of Ψ in mRNAs can have a modest impact on protein synthesis.

The temperature dependence of rhinovirus replication has been attributed to a reduced antiviral defense response of infected cells at cool temperature. Here, we show that mouse airway cells infected with mouse-adapted rhinovirus exhibit a striking enrichment in expression of antiviral defense response genes at 37 °C relative to 33 °C. This correlates with higher expression levels of type I and type III IFN genes and ISGs at 37 °C. Temperature-dependent IFN induction in response to rhinovirus is dependent on the MAVS protein, a key signaling adaptor of the RIG-I–like receptors (RLRs). Stimulation of primary airway cells with the synthetic RLR ligand poly I:C leads to greater IFN induction at 37 °C relative to 33 °C at early time points poststimulation and to a sustained increase in the induction of ISGs at 37 °C relative to 33 °C. These findings demonstrate that in mouse airway cells, rhinovirus replicates preferentially at nasal cavity temperature due, in part, to a less efficient antiviral defense response of infected cells at cool temperature. This may help explain the increased susceptibility"

This instrument is capable of providing high-resolution observations of aerosols and clouds, especially water cloud microphysical properties. We demonstrate the scientific potential of this instrument by conducting a case study over Beijing. The observations show that the increased aerosol loading led to increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius, which is consistent with expectations. However, the aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation.

Here, we use the thermostability of reconstructed ancestral enzymes to determine the temperature history of the Earth over geological time. Our results suggest that the temperature of the Earth’s surface decreased over time, a finding consistent with both previous isotope-based and protein reconstruction-based interpretations. This study demonstrates the utility of integrating genomic, geologic, and paleontologic data to provide new insight into the coevolution of life and environment over Earth history. This approach may be extended to other systems to further our understanding of the evolution of life on Earth. (Show more)"

They are activated and deactivated by two gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel opening/closing and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. We found that the BK channel, which is a large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel, lacks a classic activation gate at the intracellular end and normally shows no C-type inactivation. We induced C-type inactivation in BK channels and studied the relationship between activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery. We found that C-type inactivation in BK channels is state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. Our findings provide insights into the mechanism of the BK channel’s unique properties. (Show more)"

The Plasmodium parasite invades the human red blood cell (RBC) to complete its life cycle. The invasion process is poorly understood, and the role of the parasite’s erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 (EBA175) in this process is unknown. Here, we show that EBA175 binding to glycophorin A (GPA) on the RBC surface leads to an increase in the tension of the red cell cytoskeleton and a reduction in the bending modulus of the membrane. These changes in the red cell biophysical properties are correlated with parasite invasion efficiency. This finding suggests that the malaria parasite primes the erythrocyte surface through its binding antigens, altering the biophysical nature of the target cell and thus reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion. This would constitute a major change in our concept of malaria parasite invasion, suggesting it is, in fact, a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces working together to facilitate entry. This work provides a new perspective on the invasion process and could lead to the development of new antimalarial strategies. (Show more)"

In temperate regions, seasonal influenza outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in ambient humidity. However, the impact of low humidity on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the impact of low humidity on influenza virus infection and disease outcome. They also suggest that low humidity may be a modifiable risk factor for influenza virus infection and disease severity.

We show here that the two forms of Axin, Axin1 and Axin2, are similar at the protein level and genetically redundant. We show that the two forms of Axin are regulated differently on the transcriptional and proteostatic level, which confers differential responsiveness that can be used in tissue-specific regulation. Such subtle features may distinguish other redundant gene pairs that are commonly found in vertebrates through gene knockout experiments.

The auditory organs of these animals are extremely diverse in anatomy after hundreds of millions of years of evolution, yet they are all made up of cellular tissue and are morphologically part of the bodies of animals. Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. We find that the spider’s web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to sense the motion of web threads, which allows the spider to remotely detect and localize the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself.

The lagging strand template is replicated by DNA polymerase δ (pol δ) in a processive manner, but the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is unknown. Here, we report the results of a series of kinetic studies that provide a detailed picture of the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. Our results indicate that pol δ maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. Our results also suggest that the human pol δ holoenzyme is more stable than the S. cerevisiae pol δ holoenzyme. This difference may be important for the replication of the human genome."

We connect changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods with economic and demographic data and find that three factors predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities. Our method can be used to monitor the physical changes in cities over time and to study the causes of urban change. We hope that our method will be useful to urban scholars and practitioners."

Here, we report a simple and objective method to identify the animal origin of parchment. The method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals; however, we did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides. These results suggest that ultrafine vellum does not necessarily derive from the use of abortive or newborn animals with ultrathin hides, but could equally well reflect a production process that allowed the skins of maturing animals of several species to be rendered into vellum of equal quality and fineness.

However, the mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. Here, we show that the squid Euprymna scolopes regulates the activities of its symbiotic luminescent bacteria through the strategic provision of a single glycan, which is catabolized only at night. This glycan is delivered to the squid’s immune cells, where it is released into the symbiotic organ, where it is catabolized by the bacteria. The catabolism of this glycan is required for the persistence of the symbionts and for the acidification of the symbiotic organ, which enhances the luminescence of the symbionts.

We introduce a method to identify topics in a corpus and represent documents as topic sequences. We use this method to identify latent topics in a prominent example of underutilized text: the US National Violent Death Reporting System. Our method offers a flexible and broadly applicable approach to model topics in text data. It can be used to identify latent patterns in many domains, including social media, news, and medical records. It can also be used to identify latent topics in structured data, such as medical records, and to model the gender bias of topics.

This epidemic marked the start of the second plague pandemic, which lasted in Europe until the early 19th century. We show that the climate conditions in Asia, where the disease originated, were favorable for the survival of Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that causes plague, for centuries before the arrival of the disease in Europe. We also show that the climate conditions in Europe, where the disease established itself, were favorable for the survival of the bacterium for centuries after the arrival of the disease. Our results suggest that the Black Death was the consequence of repeated reintroductions of the bacterium into European harbors from Asian reservoirs, with a delay of 15 ± 1 y. This suggests that the Black Death was not the consequence of a single introduction of the bacterium into Europe. (Show more)"

We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects, and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. We also show that an antibody targeting IL1RAP can suppress the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action.

The RNA encodes a 28-amino acid protein that interacts with the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, GlpD, and increases dehydrogenase activity. The RNA also interferes with the ability of another sRNA to repress the ntax operon, which encodes the enzymes required for the synthesis of the cell envelope.

These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting.

Thus, we have identified a metabolic vulnerability of lymphoma cells that can be exploited for cancer therapy."

Here, we show that the proteins that are colocalized with mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), TDP-43, and Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) in the brain and spinal cord of patients with ALS are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. Rather, the inclusion bodies that contain these proteins are the result of a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. Our results suggest that the inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. This metastable state may be a common feature of neurodegenerative diseases, and may provide a target for therapeutic intervention. (Show more)"

The development of atherosclerotic lesions is a complex process that involves a series of events, including the induction of proatherosclerotic phenotypes in vascular cells. In this study, we identified a critical role of Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) in the flow regulation of vascular cells. We found that disturbed flow, a common feature of atherosclerosis, activates YAP/TAZ in vascular cells. YAP/TAZ then up-regulates the expression of genes that promote the development of atheroprone phenotypes. Our results suggest that inhibition of YAP/TAZ activation is a promising strategy for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

In the United States, the economic and ecological costs of wildfire have risen substantially in recent decades. Although climate change has likely enabled a portion of the increase in wildfire activity, the direct role of people in increasing wildfire activity has been largely overlooked. We show that humans have vastly expanded the spatial and seasonal “fire niche” in the United States, accounting for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. Human-caused wildfires disproportionally occurred where fuel moisture was higher than lightning-started fires, thereby helping expand the geographic and seasonal niche of wildfire. Actions to raise awareness and increase management in regions prone to human-started wildfires should be a focus of United States policy to reduce fire risk and associated hazards. (Abridged)"

We connect changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods with economic and demographic data and find that three factors predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities. Our method can be used to study the physical dynamics of cities in the future."

We also show that an antiviral treatment can reduce the time to undetectable plasma viral load, but that the treatment must be given early in the course of infection to be effective. Finally, we show that the timing of treatment is important for the efficacy of a polymerase inhibitor, favipiravir, and that the timing of treatment is less important for an inhibitor of the viral polymerase, ribavirin.

This signal is used by people to gauge the connection between themselves and others, and it is used by others to gauge the connection between themselves and others. This signal is so robust that it is used by third-party listeners to gauge the connection between themselves and the people they are listening to. This work provides a new way to understand connection, one that is based on the speed with which people respond to each other.

Certification also reduced the amount of forest remaining in oil palm plantations, but had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Our results suggest that certification is a promising tool for reducing deforestation, but broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation.

We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants.
