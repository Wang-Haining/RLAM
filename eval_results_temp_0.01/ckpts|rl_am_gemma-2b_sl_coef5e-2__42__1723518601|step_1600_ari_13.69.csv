It is of great interest to understand the structure of ice II in the presence of a guest molecule. In this work, we report the structure of neon hydrate at high pressure and low temperature. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The resolved structure where Ne dissolved in ice II is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. The vibration of Ne atoms is mainly in planes perpendicular to D2O channels, whereas their distributions along the channels are further constrained by interactions between adjacent Ne atoms. This work provides a new perspective on the structure of ice II and the guest–host interaction. It also provides a new route to study the structure of ice II at high pressure and low temperature.

Although the evolutionary origin of the myxozoan body plan has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we report the results of a comparative analysis of the genomes of two myxozoans and a cnidarian parasite. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. These results have implications for understanding the evolution of parasitism and the origin of the parasitic lifestyle. (Less)"

The virus responsible for this disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is able to block the action of the host immune system by inhibiting the interferon (IFN) response. In this study, we describe a mechanism of viral antagonism in which SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the nuclear pore complex (NPC) to block the nuclear import of the transcription factors STAT1 and STAT2, which are central players in the IFN response. Our findings provide a molecular understanding of the viral strategy to overcome the IFN response and contribute to the development of new antiviral strategies.

Zinc is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of zinc inhibition of the proton channel. We find that zinc binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric channels, suggesting that the zinc-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how zinc inhibits the proton channel will further our understanding of the channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for the proton channel.

This high diversity is thought to be a consequence of the ability of herbivores to partition food resources, but the extent to which they do so is unknown. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammalian herbivore species in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in body size and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages, and that herbivore diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This work provides a framework for understanding the role of herbivores in shaping plant communities and the biodiversity they contain. It also provides a model for the application of DNA metabarcoding to the study of diet in other taxa."

However, the global load of floating plastic debris is still unknown. We show that the global load of floating plastic debris is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This discrepancy is explained by the selective removal of millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

This resistance is mediated by the activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1/stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1-dependent lipogenesis, which is a mechanism that protects cancer cells from oxidative stress and ferroptosis.

We show that the policy was effective in halting the decline of older-forest–associated bird populations, but not early-seral–associated species. The policy failed to halt the decline of older forests, and the creation of early-seral ecosystems has not been sufficient to reverse declines. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure."

The best candidate is synthetically more accessible, exhibits higher binding affinity to the ribosome, and is up to 56 times more active against resistant pathogens than telithromycin. Notably, the best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

Phylogenomic analyses of these uniquely comprehensive datasets resolved controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, plant cell wall-degrading enzymes obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, both major independent origins of specialized herbivory in beetles coincide with the first appearances of an arsenal of PCWDEs encoded in their genomes. Beetle diversity thus appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding PCWDEs.

Therefore, understanding the entanglement evolution unveils how thermodynamics emerges in isolated systems. Alas, an exact computation of the entanglement dynamics was available so far only for noninteracting systems, whereas it was deemed unfeasible for interacting ones.

Actin filaments are dynamic polymers, and they can be disassembled and reassembled by proteins that bind to them. These proteins are called actin depolymerizing factors (ADF). ADF proteins are members of the cofilin family, and they are named after cofilin, the best-characterized member of the family. Here, we show that cofilin binds to actin filaments and disassembles them, but the binding is reversible. We also show that cofilin can sever actin filaments, and we propose a mechanochemical mechanism that explains how this happens. This mechanism is important for cells, because it allows them to disassemble and reassemble actin filaments in a controlled manner."

The settlement was not homogeneous across the island, suggesting that the settlement was not a single event but rather a series of independent events. In addition, we found that a few centuries are sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations.

However, the complexity of ACI makes it difficult to be well represented in climate models. The main reason is that the observational capability of ACI is inadequate. This study introduces a new technique, the dual-FOV high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL), to measure aerosol and cloud properties simultaneously. The HSRL is capable of measuring aerosol and cloud properties with high spectral resolution, which is not available in current remote-sensing techniques. The HSRL was used to investigate the interactions between aerosol loading and water cloud microphysical properties. The results show that the aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI. The HSRL is expected to become a significant contributor to the ACI investigations. This article is the first of a series of articles to be published in this journal."

The K+ channel, BK, is a major regulator of the resting membrane potential of the heart and is also involved in arrhythmia. The BK channel is unique in that it has no classic activation gate and shows no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its rates and extents inversely correlate with channel-open probability. We propose that the BK channel’s closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. This study provides a new perspective on the regulation of K+ channel function. It also provides a possible explanation for the BK channel’s unique properties and may have implications for the development of drugs for arrhythmia. (Read more)"

This finding suggests that the parasite and host cell are working together to facilitate invasion, rather than the parasite using a single mechanism to invade.

In the temperate regions, seasonal outbreaks of influenza correlate with decreases in ambient humidity. While low humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the impact of dry air on influenza virus infection and disease outcome, and may help to develop strategies to mitigate the impact of influenza in the future.

This pattern of activity is consistent with a merge operation that applies equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity. More superficial models of language, based solely on sequential transition probability over lexical and syntactic categories, only captured activity in the posterior middle temporal gyrus. Activity in those regions was consistent with a neural implementation of a bottom-up or left-corner parser of the incoming language stream.

The auditory organs of these animals are extremely diverse in anatomy after hundreds of millions of years of evolution, yet they are all made up of cellular tissue and are morphologically part of the body of the animal. Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is outsourced to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. The orb web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to sense the motion of web threads, and the spider remotely detects and localizes the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself. The outsourcing and supersizing of auditory function in spiders provides unique features for studying extended and regenerative sensing and designing novel acoustic flow detectors for precise fluid dynamic measurement and manipulation.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how HKU4 and HKU5 transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions. Our findings provide insights into the evolution of MERS-CoV and the molecular basis of cross-species transmission of bat coronaviruses. They also suggest"

We quantify the effects of climate change and human demography on fire activity and the carbon cycle using a coupled climate–fire–carbon cycle model. We find that changes in human demography tend to suppress global fire activity, keeping more carbon within terrestrial ecosystems and attenuating warming. However, climate change has already warmed the fire regime, and climate–carbon cycle feedbacks are most effective at slowing global warming under lower emission scenarios. Our study highlights that ignitions and active and passive fire suppression can be as important in driving future fire regimes as changes in climate, although with some risk of more extreme fires regionally and with implications for other ecosystem functions in fire-dependent ecosystems. Our results have implications for climate policy and for the management of fire in terrestrial ecosystems."

The island is located ∼400 km from the east coast of Africa, but its genetic and linguistic traits are from both Southeast Asia and Eastern Africa. We used a grid-based approach to sample at high resolution the genomic diversity (including maternal lineages, paternal lineages, and genome-wide data) across 257 villages and 2,704 Malagasy individuals. We find a common Bantu and Austronesian descent for all Malagasy individuals with a limited paternal contribution from Europe and the Middle East. Admixture and demographic growth happened recently, suggesting a rapid settlement of Madagascar during the last millennium. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. These results provide insights into the human history of Madagascar.

Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The RNA encodes a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC) and a 164-nucleotide RNA (denoted AzuR). The protein interacts with the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, GlpD, and increases dehydrogenase activity. The RNA also represses two carbon utilization genes, cadA and galE, by base pairing with the RNA. Interestingly, the translation of the protein interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA. This demonstrates that the translation and base-pairing functions compete. These findings provide insight into the evolution of the dual-function RNA. They also suggest that the protein may be involved in the regulation of carbon utilization."

We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility, which resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

This protein, which selectively inhibits the epoxide hydrolase function of leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) to inhibit LTB4 generation, has no effect on the aminopeptidase function of LTA4H and therefore does not impair the antiinflammatory function of LTA4H. This study provides deeper insight into immunologically privileged sites for microbial community residence in bats and supports the therapeutic potential of targeting MTX-LTA4H. The results also provide a deeper understanding of the role of MTX in the immune system and may help to explain the evolution of the immune system in bats.

We report the discovery of a small-molecule inhibitor of both human serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 and 2 (SHMT1/2). This inhibitor is effective in inhibiting colon cancer cell growth in vivo, and is particularly effective in B-cell lines. However, in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a cancer type with defective glycine import, the inhibitor is more cytotoxic than in other cancer cell lines. We show that this effect is rooted in the requirement for glycine import for survival. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas the more rigid uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into"

Herein, we found that STING is required for normal β-cell function, and its deficiency causes glucose intolerance due to impaired insulin secretion. These findings establish a pathophysiological significance of fine-tuned STING within β-cells and insulin target tissues for maintaining glucose homeostasis.

The selective packaging mechanism, in which one copy of each viral RNA is specifically packaged into each virion, is suspected, but its molecular details remain unknown. Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus. This interaction is required for optimal viral replication and favors copackaging of the interacting viral RNA segments. Our results provide insights into the molecular details of the selective packaging mechanism of the influenza A virus. They also suggest that the interaction we identified might be a general mechanism for the packaging of RNA segments in other viruses.

In this paper, we introduce a computer vision method to measure changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods from time-series street-level imagery. We connect changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities."

The underlying causes of bleaching are not fully understood, but are thought to be driven by an increase in the metabolic demand of the coral host. Here, we show that the metabolic demand of the coral host is increased during heat stress, which is compensated by the degradation of amino acids. This leads to an increase in the release of ammonium from the coral holobiont, which in turn promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. These processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host.

Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. (PsycINFO Database Record"

However, these two factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. Our findings have important implications for our ability to predict the impacts of climate change on ecosystem functioning. They also highlight the need to consider the combined effects of biodiversity loss and environmental warming in the design of conservation and restoration strategies."

The SAN is a highly specialized organ that must be able to generate a regular electrical signal at a constant rate, even when the heart is at rest. This is a remarkable feat, considering that the SAN is a tiny organ, only a few millimeters in diameter, and that it is located deep within the heart. In this study, we show that the function of the SAN is regulated by a protein called stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1). Our findings suggest that STIM1 is a key regulator of the electrical activity of the SAN.

We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits.
