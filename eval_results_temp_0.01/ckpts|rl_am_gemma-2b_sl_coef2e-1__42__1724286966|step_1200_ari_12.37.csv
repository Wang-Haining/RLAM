The most prominent reconstruction programs are due to von Neumann, Mackey, Jauch, Piron, Abramsky, and Coecke. They all attempt to provide a purely categorical axiomatization of quantum theory. The present paper provides a categorical foundation for quantum theory that is purely categorical and does not presuppose any analytical structure. It is based on a set of axioms that guarantee that the category of Hilbert spaces and bounded operators is equivalent to the category of continuous linear functions between Hilbert spaces. This result is of independent interest and may be of use in other areas of mathematics. It also addresses a question about the foundations of quantum theory raised in these reconstruction programs."

Although the evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we compare the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This transition is a remarkable example of the extreme evolutionary changes that can occur during the course of a parasitic lifestyle. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The virus has evolved a number of strategies to evade the host immune response. One of the most important strategies is the inhibition of the antiviral signaling mediated by the transcription factors STAT1 and STAT2. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2 in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes. We identified a viral accessory protein, Orf6, that is responsible for this anti-IFN activity. We show that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain. This interaction disrupts the docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupts nuclear import. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the host immune response and could lead to the development of new antiviral strategies.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1 channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels."

However, despite decades of research, we still do not know how diverse assemblages of these species coexist. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species of wild and domestic LMH. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers, and grass consumption varied from &gt;99% to &lt;1%. Grass consumption was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of % grass consumption, indicating that RRA conveys reliable quantitative information about consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption, but dietary composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages. Thus, LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

However, the global scale of the problem is still unknown. We show that the plastic debris is mostly concentrated in the convergence zones of the five subtropical gyres. However, the global load of plastic on the open ocean surface was estimated to be on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This discrepancy is explained by the size distribution of the debris, which points at important size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean.

However, the mechanisms underlying social rank are largely unknown. Here we show that trait anxiety directly influences social dominance in male outbred rats and identify an important mediating role for mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens. High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low-anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as decreased ATP and increased reactive oxygen species production in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals. We conclude that mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens is crucial for social hierarchy establishment and is critically involved in the low social competitiveness associated with high anxiety.

In this study, we found that the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis protects cancer cells from ferroptosis through induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. In contrast, SREBP1-mediated lipogenesis is required for ferroptosis induction in cancer cells with PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway mutation. Thus, the combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction shows therapeutic promise in preclinical models. This approach may be useful for cancer treatment in which the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis is activated. This study also provides a mechanism for understanding the resistance of cancer cells to ferroptosis. This knowledge may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.

The NWFP has not yet been effective in reversing the decline of older-forest–associated bird populations. This is partly because of the continued decline of older forests due to fire and clearcutting elsewhere. The NWFP has not yet been effective in reversing the decline of early-seral bird populations, but this may be because of the creation of early-seral ecosystems on federal land. The NWFP has been effective in halting the decline of early-seral bird populations.

Here, we introduce a network architecture based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice, and automatically adapts to different problems. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data. We also show that the proposed architecture is able to achieve state-of-the-art results for the problem of semantic image segmentation.

However, in contrast to congenital deficiency, this was not fatal. CTLA-4 deletion induced preferential expansion of Treg cells, but T cells from CTLA-4–deficient inducible KO mice were able to adoptively transfer the diseases into T cell-deficient mice.

It has been responsible for the deaths of millions of people in the past and continues to be a threat to human health. The Second Pandemic, which occurred between the 14th and 19th centuries, is the longest documented period of plague outbreaks in Europe. However, the vector of these epidemics is still debated. Here, we present a mathematical model for plague transmission by a human ectoparasite vector. Our results support that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by human ectoparasites during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death. This has important implications for our understanding of the history of plague and the development of control measures."

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal cells is not well understood. Here we show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1 may act as a tumor suppressor in some settings. These data suggest that TRAP1 may be a promising target for cancer therapy.

However, the structural basis for their antifungal activity is not known. Here, we report the structure of a unique antifungal peptide from the legume Medicago truncatula. This peptide is highly diverse and exhibits potent antifungal activity against multiple plant fungal pathogens. We show that this peptide binds to multiple bioactive phosphoinositides in vitro and in planta. The antifungal activity of the peptide is due to its ability to penetrate the fungal cell wall and membrane, followed by accumulation in the cytoplasm and nucleus. This work provides a structural basis for the antifungal activity of plant immune peptides and opens up the possibility of developing this class of peptides as a spray-on fungistat/fungicide.

Here, we use proteomics to characterize the posttesticular life history of the Drosophila sperm proteome and determine the extent of molecular continuity between males and females. We show that the female reproductive tract contributes to the life history of sperm, and that this contribution is critical for sperm viability during the prolonged period between copulation and fertilization. Our research provides a comprehensive characterization of sperm proteome dynamics and expands our understanding of the critical process of sperm–FRT interactions.

Here, we use the thermostability of reconstructed ancestral enzymes to infer the temperature of the surface environment over geological time. Our results suggest that the surface environment cooled over time from ∼80 °C in the Archean to the present ∼15 °C. This finding is consistent with both isotopic and protein reconstruction-based interpretations of the temperature history of the surface environment.

We induced C-type inactivation in BK channels and studied the relationship between activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery. We observed prominent slow C-type inactivation/recovery in BK channels by an extreme low concentration of extracellular K+ together with a Y294E/K/Q/S or Y279F mutation whose equivalent in Shaker channels (T449E/K/D/Q/S or W434F) caused a greatly accelerated rate of C-type inactivation or constitutive C-inactivation.

Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden.

The merge operation was not limited to simple sequences of words but applied equally to multiword phrases. More superficial models of language, based on sequential transition probability, only captured activity in the posterior middle temporal gyrus. Activity in superior temporal and inferior frontal cortices was consistent with a neural implementation of a bottom-up or left-corner parser of the incoming language stream. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases.

The auditory organs of these animals are extremely diverse in anatomy after hundreds of millions of years of evolution, yet all are made up of cellular tissue and are morphologically part of the bodies of animals. Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. We find that the wispy, wheel-shaped orb web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to capture the sound-induced air particle movements that approach the maximum physical efficiency better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By sensing the motion of web threads, the spider remotely detects and localizes the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave, such as those emitted by approaching prey or predators. By outsourcing and supersizing of auditory function in spiders provides unique features for studying extended and regenerative sensing and designing novel acoustic flow detectors for precise fluid dynamic measurement and manipulation.

This could be up to 5.55 million per year by additionally controlling nonfossil anthropogenic sources. The chemical influence of air pollution on aeolian dust contributes to the aerosol cooling. Since aerosols mask the anthropogenic rise in global temperature, removing fossil-fuel-generated particles liberates 0.51 °C and all pollution particles 0.73 °C, thus limiting global warming to 2 °C.

These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. The findings highlight the importance of psychological examinations of masculinity as a cultural ideology to understand how men’s and women’s endorsement of hegemonic masculinity legitimizes patriarchal dominance and reinforces gender, race, and class-based hierarchies via candidate support.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions.

This method could be used to identify the animal origin of parchment from the past and the present. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The age model for this extinction event is critical for understanding the causes and consequences of the extinction and recovery dynamics. We present a new age model for the extinction based on U-Pb dating of volcanic ash beds. The age model indicates that the extinction occurred between 251.941 ± 0.037 and 251.880 ± 0.031 Mya, an interval of 60 ± 48 ka. The carbon cycle reorganization precedes the extinction and is punctuated by a sharp negative spike in the isotopic composition of carbonate carbon. The carbon cycle volatility persists for ∼500 ka before a return to near preextinction values. The new age model will allow a refined evaluation of the relative roles of rate-dependent processes contributing to the extinction, permitting insight into postextinction ecosystem expansion. The new age model will also allow a more accurate evaluation of the trigger and kill hypotheses. The new age model will also allow a more accurate evaluation of the trigger and kill hypotheses.

It is involved in various biological processes, including circadian rhythm, cancer, and metabolism. However, the function of RORα in the intestine is still unclear. Here, we generated intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific RORα-deficient mice and found that RORα is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis by attenuating nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcriptional activity. RORαΔIEC mice exhibit excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis reveals corecruitment of RORα and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) on NF-κB target promoters and subsequent dismissal of CREB binding protein (CBP) and bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) for transcriptional repression. Together, we demonstrate that RORα/HDAC3-mediated attenuation of NF-κB signaling controls the balance of"

Chitin is released by hemocytes from the squid’s immune cells, just before dusk, and is catabolized by the symbionts, whose activity is dependent on the timing of this nutrient delivery. This glycan is thus used by the squid to regulate the growth of its symbionts, which in turn are required for the squid to produce light at night. This study provides a new perspective on the regulation of symbiosis by the provision of nutrients.

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The RNA encodes a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC) that interacts with aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (denoted GlpD) and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that the RNA base pairs with two genes, cadA and galE, that are repressed by AzuC. Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA. The translation and base-pairing functions compete. This is the first example of a dual-function RNA in which the protein function is dependent on translation. This work provides insight into the function of dual-function RNAs in bacteria.

The explosion created a fireball, shock wave, and a crater, as well as a 50-m-tall tower of sand, copper, and other materials. The tower was later excavated, and the material was found to be a glassy mixture of sand, copper, and other materials. We report the discovery of a hitherto unknown composition of icosahedral quasicrystal in this material. The discovery of this quasicrystal, which was formed by a nuclear explosion, has implications for the search for extraterrestrial materials. It also demonstrates that quasicrystals can be formed by extreme pressure–temperature conditions, which are common in the Earth’s crust. This discovery has implications for the search for quasicrystals in the Earth’s crust.

Photosynthesis relies on these modified tetrapyrroles for the capture of solar radiation and its conversion to chemical energy. The formation of the isocyclic fifth ring, the key reaction in the biosynthesis of chlorophyll, has remained enigmatic for more than 60 y. This reaction is catalyzed by two unrelated cyclase enzymes using different chemistries. The majority of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria use BchE, an O2-sensitive [4Fe-4S] cluster protein, whereas plants, cyanobacteria, and some phototrophic bacteria possess an O2-dependent enzyme, the major catalytic component of which is a diiron protein, AcsF. Plant and cyanobacterial mutants in ycf54 display impaired function of the O2-dependent enzyme, accumulating the reaction substrate. Swapping cyclases between cyanobacteria and purple phototrophic bacteria reveals three classes of the O2-dependent enzyme. These data delineate three classes of O2-dependent cyclase in chlorophototrophic organisms from higher plants to bacteria, and their evolution is discussed herein. (Show more)"

In this study, we found that ASK1 in microglia/macrophages plays a major role in generating and maintaining disease. ASK1-deficient microglia/macrophages exhibited reduced neuroinflammation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We also found that ASK1 in astrocytes plays a proinflammatory role in the later stage of EAE.

The drought began in 2012 and has led to acute water shortages, groundwater overdraft, critically low streamflow, and enhanced wildfire risk. We find that precipitation deficits that occurred when conditions were warm were more than twice as likely to yield drought years. We also find that although there has not been a substantial change in the probability of either negative or moderately negative precipitation anomalies in recent decades, the occurrence of drought years has been greater in the past two decades than in the preceding century. In addition, the probability that precipitation deficits co-occur with warm conditions and the probability that precipitation deficits produce drought have both increased. We conclude that anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of co-occurring warm–dry conditions like those that have created the acute human and ecosystem impacts associated with the “exceptional” 2012–2014 drought in California.

The etiology of autism is so complicated because it involves the effects of variants of several hundred risk genes along with the contribution of environmental factors. Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. As an alternative approach, extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying the convergence of the targets and functions of the autism-risk genes to facilitate mapping out causal paths. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. Mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility"

We show that aggregates accumulate at synaptic terminals and spread throughout the brain, causing damage to vulnerable neurons. We also show that the spread of aggregates is dependent on endocytosis in the spreading neurons.

However, the mechanisms by which this is achieved are poorly understood. Here, we show that the squid Euprymna scolopes regulates the activities of its luminescent symbionts through the strategic provision of a single glycan, chitin. Chitin is released by host hemocytes into the symbiotic crypts just before dusk, when the squid is ready to receive the glycan. Chitin catabolism by the symbionts is required for a periodic acidification of the crypts, which increases the level of oxygen available to the symbionts and enhances their capacity to produce bioluminescence at night. This study provides a mechanism for the regulation of the activities of symbionts in their host’s tissues. It also suggests that other hosts may similarly regulate the activities of their associated microbes through the strategic provision of specific nutrients, whose catabolism modulates conditions like pH or anoxia in the habitat of the symbionts. This may be a general mechanism for the regulation of symbiosis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Virions require spike (S) proteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Virions must first be cleaved sequentially by cell-surface proteases, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. Here, we show that the first cleavages are significant for virus infection into human lung-derived cells, but not into other cell types. These findings suggest that the first cleavages are significant for virus virulence. Therefore, the first cleavages may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence. Understanding the determinants of MERS-CoV virulence may lead to the development of more effective therapies and vaccines. Copyright © 2016. Published by Elsevier Inc."

The food choices of the population have a large influence on these emissions. Increasing the proportion of vegetarian meals in catering settings could have a significant impact on reducing these emissions. This study shows that increasing the proportion of vegetarian meals available in a catering setting can have a large impact on sales. This suggests that simple changes to catering practices could have a large impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This study also shows that the impact of increasing the proportion of vegetarian meals available is concentrated among diners who are already choosing vegetarian meals. This suggests that increasing the proportion of vegetarian meals available could have a large impact on the health of the population while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This study provides evidence to support the potential for simple changes to catering practices to make an important contribution to achieving more sustainable diets at the population level.

It is a dynamic and complex environment, and the cell surface proteome is a major component of this interface. Here we use a combination of methods to study the surfaceome of a breast epithelial cell line stably expressing six of the most common oncogenes. We find that each oncogene has a different surfaceome, but that the functions of these proteins are harmonized by common biological themes including up-regulation of nutrient transporters, down-regulation of adhesion molecules, and alteration in immune modulators. These studies provide a broad systems-level view of how specific driver oncogenes remodel the surfaceome and the glycoproteome in a cell autologous fashion, and suggest possible surface targets, and combinations thereof, for drug and biomarker discovery. This work is a first step toward understanding the surfaceome of cancer cells. The surfaceome is a promising target for drug and biomarker discovery.

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive design-based analysis of the effect of universal vote-by-mail—a policy under which every voter is mailed a ballot in advance of the election—on electoral outcomes. We find that universal vote-by-mail does not appear to affect either party’s share of turnout, does not appear to increase either party’s vote share, and modestly increases overall average turnout rates. All three conclusions support the conventional wisdom of election administration experts and contradict many popular claims in the media. Our results suggest that vote-by-mail is a safe and effective way to conduct elections during the COVID-19 pandemic."

The virus has a large number of accessory proteins that are rapidly evolving, and it is unclear how these proteins contribute to the severity of the disease. Here, we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 ORF8, which is a rapidly evolving accessory protein. The structure reveals a unique dimerization interface that is specific to SARS-CoV-2. This interface is likely important for immune evasion and immune suppression. The structure also reveals a second interface that is not present in SARS-CoV, suggesting that the two viruses have evolved different strategies to evade the immune system. These results provide insight into the molecular basis of the unique properties of SARS-CoV-2. (Show more)"

CRF acts on the cortex via its receptor CRFR1 to trigger signaling of cAMP/PKA in astrocytes, leading to activation of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and cerebral edema. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying cerebral edema and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies. This article is protected by copyright.

ETV2-induced ETVECs exhibit EC characteristics in vitro and form mature functional vasculature in vivo. These results indicate that ETV2 is a promising factor for the generation of ECs. Furthermore, ETV2 can be used for the generation of ECs from nonvascular cells, such as fibroblasts, and for the formation of vascular networks in vivo.

The material delivers a large capacity of ∼170 mA ⋅ h ⋅ g−1 with a low operating potential range of 1.9 to 2.8 versus Li/Li+ in 21 m lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide (LiTFSA) aqueous electrolyte. A full cell consisting of Li1.05Mn1.95O4/Li9/7Nb2/7Mo3/7O2 presents high energy density of 107 W ⋅ h ⋅ kg−1 as the maximum value in 21 m LiTFSA aqueous electrolyte, and 73% in capacity retention is achieved after 2,000 cycles. Furthermore, hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study reveals that a protective surface layer is formed at the surface of the negative electrode, by which the high-energy and durable aqueous batteries are"

In mammals, this ability is lost during development, and the adult nervous system is incapable of regenerating. Here, we identify a form of regeneration that is independent of the canonical MAPK signaling pathway. This form of regeneration is triggered by sensory activity and is similar to a form of endogenous activity-dependent ectopic axon outgrowth in the same neuron type. These findings suggest that this form of regeneration may be a powerful platform for gene discovery in the study of neuronal regeneration. Moreover, our study unifies disparate forms of neuronal outgrowth to uncover fresh molecular insights into activity-dependent control of the adult nervous system’s intrinsic regenerative capacity.

In this paper, we describe the distribution of recombination across the genome of a flowering plant. We find that recombination is concentrated in hotspots, which are interspersed with cold regions. The distribution of recombination is similar to that in yeast and in mice. This suggests that the general pattern of recombination described here in Mimulus may reflect ancient and conserved eukaryotic mechanisms. This work provides a foundation for understanding the evolution of recombination in plants. It also has implications for understanding the evolution of recombination in humans."

The analysis of these fluctuations has led to the identification of a small number of reproducible networks, which are assumed to represent the main functional systems of the brain. However, the total activity of the brain is not fluctuating, and the analysis of metabolic signals can provide a more complete picture of brain activity. Here, we show that the dominant metabolic RSN in healthy subjects is topographically similar to the DMN, but that this pattern is subordinated in Parkinson’s disease. The dominant RSN is also reduced in cognitive and motor dysfunction in PD, and is reduced earlier in PD than in Alzheimer’s disease. These results suggest that metabolic imaging can provide information about the resting organization of the brain in health and disease. This approach may be useful for the early diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression."

However, the role of FSIP1 in the progression and drug sensitivity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies.

However, these factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. This is a critical insight for understanding the impacts of climate change on the functioning of ecosystems. It also has implications for the design of biodiversity conservation strategies. The maintenance of biodiversity is not only important for maintaining ecosystem services, but also for ensuring that ecosystems can adapt to environmental change. Our results suggest that this adaptation will be compromised if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits."

However, the history of the last 500 million years is poorly understood because of the scarcity of high-resolution, multiproxy records. Here, we present a high-resolution record of a global warming event that occurred ∼304 Ma. We show that the event was linked to an increase in atmospheric CO2 and a biodiversity nadir. We also show that the event was linked to an increase in nutrient fluxes and thermocline stratification. These results have implications for the history of the Earth system and for the development of future climate models. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

We show that RSPO certification is associated with reduced deforestation in oil palm plantations. However, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results highlight the importance of certification in forested regions and the need for certification to be tightly linked to the protection of remaining forest. These findings are important for the future of sustainability certification in the palm oil sector."

In humans, its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. The exocyst complex is composed of 10 evolutionarily conserved subunits. The small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

In vertebrates, sex is determined by a single locus, which can be male- or female-determining. In species with a single locus, the sex of an individual is determined by the sex of the parent, and the sex of the offspring is determined by the sex of the parent. In species with multiple loci, the sex of an individual is determined by the sex of the parent and the sex of the offspring. Here we investigate the effects of multiple loci on secondary sexual characteristics in a fish species with four possible sex classes."

We show that the intracellular levels of iron, which are elevated in retinal pigment epithelial cells, promote the oxidation and degradation of bisretinoids. These findings have implications for the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in the elderly. The results also suggest that the addition of iron chelators to current therapies for age-related macular degeneration may be beneficial. This is an important step toward the development of new therapies for this blinding disease. (Show more)"

However, the evolution of specialization is often considered a dead end due to the constraints associated with the evolution of morphological and functional optimizations throughout the organism. Here we show that siphonophores, a group of pelagic cnidarians, can evolve into specialists on different prey types. Our results suggest that shifts between prey types are linked to shifts in the morphology, mode of evolution, and evolutionary correlations of tentilla and their nematocysts. These findings contribute to understanding how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs. They also help build a broader perspective on predatory niche diversification via morphological innovation and evolution. This perspective is important for understanding the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems."

The origin of these features is a matter of intense debate, but the fossil record has thus far failed to provide unambiguous evidence for the evolution of the key features of the human hand. Here we report the discovery of a hominin hand fossil from East Africa that preserves the third metacarpal styloid process, a key feature of the human hand that is absent in all other primates. This fossil provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of this key feature of the human hand. The discovery of this fossil also suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo. This finding has important implications for our understanding of the evolution of the human hand and its relationship to the Neandertal hand. This article is protected by copyright.

One-carbon units are essential for cell growth, and are provided by the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). Here we identify a small-molecule inhibitor of SHMT, and show that it blocks tumor growth in a mouse model of colon cancer. We also show that the one-carbon donor formate can rescue cells from SHMT inhibition, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in a cancer cell-line screen. This effect is rooted in defective glycine import, which is a targetable metabolic deficiency of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Thus, defective glycine import is a metabolic deficiency of cancer cells that can be targeted therapeutically. This work provides a rationale for the use of formate as a metabolic targeting agent in cancer. Formate is a by-product of fermentation, and thus the use of formate in cancer therapy may be applicable to a broad range of cancers. Formate is also a precursor for the biosynthesis of the antibiotic valinomycin, which is used in the fuel cells of the future. Thus, formate may be a useful antibiotic for the treatment of cancer in the future."

Agricultural intensification is a key strategy to address these challenges, but it is often at the expense of natural landscapes such as forests. This study shows that deforestation can reduce people’s access to fruits and vegetables, which are important sources of micronutrients. Conversely, forest fragmentation can increase access to these foods, thus improving people’s diets. These findings have important implications for policy makers, who should consider the role of forests in improving people’s diets and nutrition security. This study also highlights the need to consider the role of natural landscapes in strategies to improve food and nutrition security. This is particularly important in low- and middle-income countries where forests are often overlooked in such strategies."

We show that the weight of modern farm vehicles has increased the mechanical stress in the subsoil to levels that are close to the safe limits for soil functioning. This has resulted in the widespread subsoil compaction, with potential loss of productivity. We hypothesize that the roaming of sauropods on land may have had similar adverse effects on soil productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. Our findings have implications for the design of farm machinery and for the study of prehistoric ecosystems. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
