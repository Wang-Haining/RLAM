However, the guest molecule is usually a small molecule, such as CO2 or CH4. In this work, we report the synthesis and in situ neutron diffraction study of a hydrate with a guest molecule of neon. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The resolved structure where Ne dissolved in ice II is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. The guest Ne atoms are found to be mainly in planes perpendicular to D2O channels, whereas their distributions along the channels are further constrained by interactions between adjacent Ne atoms.

The most prominent reconstruction programs, those of von Neumann, Mackey, Jauch, Piron, Abramsky, and Coecke, all rely on the existence of a category of states of a quantum system that is equivalent to the category of continuous linear functionals on a suitable vector space. We provide a purely categorical characterization of this category. The axioms are formulated in terms of a single binary operation on a class of categories. This addresses a question about the foundations of quantum theory raised in reconstruction programs such as those of von Neumann, Mackey, Jauch, Piron, Abramsky, and Coecke. The axioms are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. This resolves a long-standing problem in the foundations of quantum theory. The axioms are also of independent interest in category theory. The class of categories satisfying the axioms is shown to be closed under certain types of limits and colimits. The class is also closed under retracts, and the class is shown to be closed under a certain type of fibered product. The class is also closed under certain limits and colimits of categories of topological spaces. The class is"

Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we compare the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. These results provide insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. They also highlight the potential for genome sequencing to provide insights into the origin and evolution of parasitic lifestyles.

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We found that SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 evades IFN-mediated antiviral signaling and provides a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

We quantify the impact of climate change on maize yields and yield variability in the major maize-producing and -exporting countries. We find that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields increases almost everywhere to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields. For the top four maize-exporting countries, which account for 87% of global maize exports, the probability that they have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. They also underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven LMH species (six wild, one domestic) in semiarid African savanna. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers. Grass consumption inferred from DNA sequences was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of grass consumption, indicating that DNA metabarcoding can be used to quantify diet breadth and composition. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. These findings have implications for understanding the role of LMH in ecosystem functioning and biodiversity. This is an open-access"

Several themes emerged. First, mass layoffs and closures had already occurred—just a few weeks into the crisis. Second, the risk of closure was negatively associated with the expected length of the crisis. Moreover, businesses had widely varying beliefs about the likely duration of COVID-related disruptions. Third, many small businesses are financially fragile: The median business with more than $10,000 in monthly expenses had only about 2 wk of cash on hand at the time of the survey. Fourth, the majority of businesses planned to seek funding through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. However, many anticipated problems with accessing the program, such as bureaucratic hassles and difficulties establishing eligibility. Using experimental variation, we also assess take-up rates and business resilience effects for loans relative to grants-based programs.

However, the magnitude and the fate of this pollution are still open questions. Using data from the Malaspina 2010 circumnavigation, regional surveys, and previously published reports, we show a worldwide distribution of plastic on the surface of the open ocean, mostly accumulating in the convergence zones of each of the five subtropical gyres with comparable density. However, the global load of plastic on the open ocean surface was estimated to be on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean. We propose a hypothesis for the fate of the missing plastic debris. This hypothesis is based on the observations of the size distribution of floating plastic debris, which points at important size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale.

There are signs, however, of stabilization and more effective management in recent years, with a reduction in fleet sizes in developed countries. Based on historical patterns and allowing for the slowing rate of expansion, 1 million more motorized vessels could join the global fleet by midcentury as developing countries continue to transition away from subsistence fisheries.

In placental mammals, the mother’s ability to reproduce is limited by her own energy reserves. All forms of external energy provisioning increase reproductive output, but the extent to which this increase is realized depends on the form of the provisioning. We find that all forms of external energy provisioning correlate with larger litters without compromising offspring size. The greatest increase we observe in reproductive power is in species that practice allonursing. Our results suggest that the ultimate factor limiting reproductive output in placental mammals is maternal metabolic power rather than resource availability.

The cytopathological hallmark of MSA is α-syn accumulation in affected oligodendrocytes. We present here an in vivo proof of concept of the ability of the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 to mitigate α-syn pathology and to mediate neuroprotection in a mouse model of MSA. VX-765 prevented motor deficits in the mouse model and reduced α-syn load in the striatum. More importantly, VX-765 showed neuroprotective effects by preserving tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in the substantia nigra. In conclusion, our results suggest that VX-765, a drug that was well tolerated in a 6 wk-long phase II trial in patients with epilepsy, is a promising candidate to achieve disease modification in synucleinopathies by limiting α-syn accumulation.

It is a highly specialized cell type that controls vascular contractility, hemostasis, and inflammation and regulates the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products between circulating blood and tissue. To control each function, the endothelium processes endlessly arriving requests from multiple sources using separate clusters of cells specialized to detect specific stimuli. A well-developed but poorly understood communication system operates between cells to integrate multiple lines of information and coordinate endothelial responses. Here, the nature of the communication network has been addressed using single-cell Ca2+ imaging across thousands of endothelial cells in intact blood vessels. Cell activities were cross-correlated and compared to a stochastic model to determine network connections. Highly correlated Ca2+ activities occurred in scattered cell clusters, and network communication links between them exhibited unexpectedly short path lengths. The number of connections between cells (degree distribution) followed a power-law relationship revealing a scale-free network topology. The path length and degree distribution revealed an endothelial network with a “small-world” configuration.

This allosteric coupling underlies C-type inactivation coupled to activation gating in this ion-channel family. We have identified the second Threonine residue within the TTVGYGD signature sequence of K+ channels as a crucial residue for this allosteric communication. A Threonine to Alanine substitution at this position was studied in three representative members of the K+-channel family. Interestingly, all of the mutant channels exhibited lack of C-type inactivation gating and an inversion of their allosteric coupling (i.e., closing of the activation gate collapses the channel’s selectivity filter). A state-dependent crystallographic study of KcsA-T75A proves that, on activation, the selectivity filter transitions from a nonconductive and deep C-type inactivated conformation to a conductive one. Finally, we provide a crystallographic demonstration that closed-state inactivation can be achieved by the structural collapse of the channel’s selectivity filter.

High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low-anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as decreased ATP and increased ROS production in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals. We conclude that mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens is crucial for social hierarchy establishment and is critically involved in the low social competitiveness associated with high anxiety.

However, the use of a single material phase and heuristically developed structural patterns leads to restricted design space and potential failure to achieve specific target behaviors. Here, through a free-form inverse design approach, multiple hyperelastic materials with distinct properties are optimally synthesized into composite structures to precisely achieve arbitrary and extreme responses. The digitally synthesized structures exhibit organic shapes and motions with irregular distributions of material phases. Within the structures, different materials play distinct roles yet seamlessly collaborate through sophisticated deformation mechanisms to produce the target behaviors. While complex in geometry and material heterogeneity, the discovered structures are effectively manufactured via multimaterial fabrication with different polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomers with distinct behaviors and their highly nonlinear responses are physically and accurately realized in experiments. To enhance programmability, the synthesized structures are heteroassembled into architectures that exhibit highly complex yet navigable responses. The proposed synthesis, multimaterial fabrication, and heteroassembly strategy can be utilized to design function-oriented and situation-specific mechanical devices for a wide range of applications. The design of programmable and extreme-response mechanical structures is greatly facilitated. The study provides a general approach to design mechanical devices"

Here we show that the insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) is expressed in human erythroid tissues and that IGF2BP1 can reprogram the hemoglobin expression pattern in human erythroblasts toward a more fetal-like phenotype. This suggests a mechanism for chronoregulation of fetal and adult hemoglobin expression in humans. The results also suggest that IGF2BP1 may be a potential therapeutic target for hemoglobinopathies.

In this study, we found that activating mutation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) function, highly frequent events in human cancer, confers ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells, and that inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis induction. Mechanistically, this resistance requires sustained activation of mTORC1 and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)C1-dependent induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. Furthermore, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a transcriptional target of SREBP1, mediates the ferroptosis-suppressing activity of SREBP1 by producing monounsaturated fatty acids.

Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. Our findings unravel a mechanism of LCCBs action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI.

We used &gt;25 years of bird surveys to test whether the NWFP’s policy of reducing clearcutting and increasing old-growth-like forests stabilized populations of older-forest–associated birds and reversed declines of early-seral–associated birds. We found that the NWFP halted declines of early-seral–associated birds, but older-forest–associated birds continued to decline. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure. Our results also highlight the importance of monitoring and adaptive management to ensure that policies are effective. Our findings are relevant to other policies that aim to restore biodiversity. The NWFP is a unique case study, but the principles of monitoring and adaptive management are widely applicable.

Here, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

Phylogenomic analyses of these uniquely comprehensive datasets resolved previously controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, both major independent origins of specialized herbivory in beetles coincide with the first appearances of an arsenal of PCWDEs encoded in their genomes. Beetle diversity thus appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding PC"

We demonstrate that the nucleation of the body-centered cubic phase of iron is much easier than that of the hexagonal close-packed phase, which is the stable phase of iron at the inner core conditions. This mechanism reduces the required undercooling of iron nucleation, which provides a key factor in solving the inner core nucleation paradox.

In ventral striatum (key brain reward region), MP-induced increases in DA were inversely correlated with scores of negative emotionality, which were significantly higher for marijuana abusers than controls. The attenuated responses to MP, including reduced decreases in striatal DA, are consistent with decreased brain reactivity to the DA stimulation in marijuana abusers that might contribute to their negative emotionality (increased stress reactivity and irritability) and addictive behaviors.

They also suggest that DA responses in reward-related brain regions might be a promising biomarker for predicting the addictive potential of drugs that stimulate DA.

These results provide computational evidence that predictive processing fundamentally shapes the language comprehension mechanisms in the human brain. They also suggest that the most powerful models of language processing in the brain may be capturing the core mechanisms of language comprehension.

The disease is characterized by progressive loss of sensation and disfigurement of the face. The disease is curable with multidrug therapy, but the cause of the disease remains unknown. We sequenced the genome of a patient with leprosy from Mexico and compared it with that of Mycobacterium leprae. The genomes are similar in size and synteny, and the genomes have undergone extensive pseudogenization. The patient also harbored a genome of an uncultured pathogen, Mycobacterium lepromatosis, which is closer to the MRCA than M. leprae. The two leprosy pathogens are remarkably conserved and still cause similar pathologic conditions.

The study of quantum quenches revealed that these concepts are intricately intertwined. Although the unitary time evolution ensuing from a pure state maintains the system at zero entropy, local properties at long times are captured by a statistical ensemble with nonzero thermodynamic entropy, which is the entanglement accumulated during the dynamics. Therefore, understanding the entanglement evolution unveils how thermodynamics emerges in isolated systems. Alas, an exact computation of the entanglement dynamics was available so far only for noninteracting systems, whereas it was deemed unfeasible for interacting ones. Here, we show that the standard quasiparticle picture of the entanglement evolution, complemented with integrability-based knowledge of the steady state and its excitations, leads to a complete understanding of the entanglement dynamics in the space–time scaling limit. We thoroughly check our result for the paradigmatic Heisenberg chain. We also show that the entanglement dynamics in the space–time scaling limit is universal, in the sense that it is independent of the microscopic details of the system.

In addition, the furin cleavage site within the spike protein was deleted from the viral genome for added safety of the vaccine strain. The vaccine candidate generated high levels of spike-specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies in hamsters. Upon challenge with WT virus, COVI-VAC vaccination reduced lung challenge viral titers, resulted in undetectable virus in the brain, and protected hamsters from almost all SARS-CoV-2–associated weight loss.

Using Bayesian inference, we found that this model fits mortality curves from nine outbreaks in Europe better than models for pneumonic or rodent transmission. Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346–1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats.

We show that the evolution of brain size is not the only factor that determines the cognitive capacity of animals. We use the largest dataset of its kind to reconstruct the evolution of brain size in amniotes and show that reptiles have not only small brains relative to body size but also low neuronal densities, resulting in average neuron numbers over 20 times lower than those in birds and mammals of similar body size. Amniote brain evolution is characterized by the following four major shifts in neuron–brain scaling. The most dramatic increases in brain neurons occurred independently with the appearance of birds and mammals, resulting in convergent neuron scaling in the two endotherm lineages. The other two major increases in the number of neurons happened in core land birds and anthropoid primates, which are two groups known for their cognitive prowess. Interestingly, relative brain size is associated with relative neuronal cell density in reptiles, birds, and primates but not in other mammals.

However, current inhibitors cannot distinguish between HSP90 and TRAP1, making their utility as probes of TRAP1-specific function questionable. We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This study also provides a rationale for the development of TRAP1-directed therapies. The TRAP1-specific inhibitor 17-A-E, which we have developed, is currently in"

However, how ADF does so in a physiological context, where filaments are interconnected and under mechanical stress, remains unclear. Here, we monitor and quantify the action of ADF in different mechanical situations by using single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques, coupled to microfluidics. We find that local curvature favors severing, while tension surprisingly has no effect on ADF binding and weakly enhances severing. Remarkably, we observe that filament segments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist, experience a mechanical torque upon ADF binding. We find that this ADF-induced torque increases the severing rate constant 100-fold. A consequence of this mechanism is that cross-linked filament networks are severed by cofilin far more efficiently than nonconnected filaments. We propose that this mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. This mechanism may be important for many cellular processes, including cytokinesis and cell migration. Our findings have implications for understanding actin dynamics in cells.

We investigated the effects of fructose versus glucose on brain, hormone, and appetitive responses to food cues and food-approach behavior. Twenty-four healthy volunteers underwent two fMRI sessions with ingestion of either fructose or glucose in a double-blinded, random-order cross-over design. Ingestion of fructose relative to glucose resulted in smaller increases in plasma insulin levels and greater brain reactivity to food cues in the visual cortex and left orbital frontal cortex. Parallel to the neuroimaging findings, fructose versus glucose led to greater hunger and desire for food and a greater willingness to give up long-term monetary rewards to obtain immediate high-calorie foods. These findings suggest that ingestion of fructose relative to glucose results in greater activation of brain regions involved in attention and reward processing and may promote feeding behavior. Our results suggest that fructose may be a weaker suppressor of appetite than glucose. They also suggest that fructose may promote overeating and weight gain.

This paper tests the hypothesis that aquatic mammals are constrained to a size attractor in the water by energetic constraints on feeding and thermoregulation. We find that the evolution of an aquatic lifestyle is driving three of the four extant aquatic mammal clades toward a size attractor at ∼500 kg. The existence of this body size attractor and the relatively rapid selection toward, and limited deviation from, this attractor rule out most hypothesized drivers of size increase. These three independent body size increases and a shared aquatic optimum size are consistent with control by differences in the scaling of energetic intake and cost functions with body size between the terrestrial and aquatic realms. Under this energetic model, thermoregulatory costs constrain minimum size, whereas limitations on feeding efficiency constrain maximum size. The optimum size occurs at an intermediate value where thermoregulatory costs are low but feeding efficiency remains high. Rather than being released from size pressures, water-dwelling mammals are driven and confined to larger body sizes by the strict energetic demands of the aquatic medium. This model provides a mechanistic explanation for the evolution of aquatic mammals and their larger-than-land relatives. This model also has implications for"

It is able to cause infections by producing a variety of virulence factors, including toxins, proteases, and biofilm-inducing molecules. Here we show that P. aeruginosa uses its type IV pili for surface sensing. Type IV pili are major surface adhesins, but their activity is also required for the pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa. We demonstrate that type IV pili are required for the detection of surfaces and for the regulation of virulence. We also show that type IV pili are mechanosensitive and that the mechanical activity of pili is sensed by a methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein-like chemosensory system. This mechanochemical model for surface sensing and regulation of virulence factors in P. aeruginosa is unique among bacterial pathogens. It provides a new paradigm for the use of pili in sensing the environment and regulating virulence. It also suggests that type IV pili may be a target for new antibiotics. This study thus provides a new perspective on the role of pili in bacterial pathogens. It also provides a new paradigm for the use of pili in sensing the environment and regulating virulence.

However, the role of Aβ in the initiation and progression of AD is still unclear. Here, we show that neurons are the major source of inflammatory factors in AD. We demonstrate that Aβ-burdened neurons produce a variety of potent immune factors, both at the transcript and protein levels. Moreover, we identify an inflammatory profile unique to Aβ-burdened neurons, since neighboring glial cells did not express similar molecules. Importantly, we show that a neuron-specific inflammatory response may precede insoluble Aβ plaque and tau tangle formation in the human brain. Thus, we reveal the Aβ-burdened neuron as a primary proinflammatory agent, implicating the intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ as a significant immunological component in the AD pathogenesis. Our findings have important implications for the development of therapeutic strategies for AD. Our results suggest that targeting Aβ-burdened neurons may be a promising approach for AD treatment. This study also provides a rationale for the use of Aβ-burdened neurons as a source of biomarkers for AD. Finally"

The results of our faunal analysis demonstrate that the Hellenistic (fourth–second centuries B.C.E.) site of Maresha, Israel, is the earliest site known today where economic exploitation of chickens was widely practiced. We base our claim on the exceptionally high frequency of chicken bones at that site, the majority of which belong to adult individuals, and on the observed 2:1 ratio of female to male bones. These results are supported further by an extensive survey of faunal remains from 234 sites in the Southern Levant, spanning more than three millennia, which shows a sharp increase in the frequency of chicken during the Hellenistic period. We further argue that the earliest secure evidence for economic exploitation of chickens in Europe dates to the first century B.C.E. and therefore is predated by the finds in the Southern Levant by at least a century. We suggest that the gradual acclimatization of chickens in the Southern Levant and its gradual integration into the local economy, the latter fully accomplished in the Hellenistic period, was a crucial step in the adoption of this species in European husbandry some 100 y later."

We have used a high-resolution hydrogen exchange method to study the folding of the large two-domain maltose binding protein. The results show that the folding process is multistep, with a fast collapse into a polyglobular state, a slower formation of a distinct intermediate, and a longer-time-constant folding to the native state. The intermediate is an obligatory step on the folding pathway and contains the sites of three previously reported destabilizing mutations. The intermediate is composed of segments that are distant in the MBP sequence but adjacent in the native protein. The intermediate is a native-like folding intermediate that is formed before the native state is reached. These results add a large protein to the list of proteins known to fold through distinct native-like intermediates in distinct pathways. The results also suggest that the intermediate is a common feature of large protein folding. This is the first time that a native-like folding intermediate has been observed in a large protein. The results are important for understanding the folding of large proteins. They also provide a basis for the design of new proteins with improved properties.

In bacteria, the predominant decapping enzyme ApaH is inactivated by the very conditions of disulfide stress that enable Np4-capped RNAs to accumulate to high levels. Here, we show that, in cells experiencing such stress, the pyrophosphohydrolase RppH assumes a leading role in decapping those transcripts, preferring them as substrates over their triphosphorylated and diphosphorylated counterparts. The unique manner in which capped substrates of this kind bind to the active site of RppH positions the δ-phosphate, rather than the β-phosphate, for hydrolytic attack, generating triphosphorylated RNA as the primary product of decapping. This study reveals a mechanism for how the cellular concentration of alarmones can be used to regulate decapping of capped transcripts. The unconventional manner in which RppH recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress.

We found that citrulline, an arginine metabolite, was more efficient than arginine in increasing arginine plasma levels and restoring T cell mitochondrial function and proliferation while reducing immunosuppression. Because there is no specific therapeutic strategy to restore immune function after sepsis, we believe that our study provides evidence for developing citrulline-based clinical studies in sepsis.

We find that the kingdoms of life concentrate at different locations on the planet; plants (≈450 Gt C) are primarily terrestrial, whereas animals (≈2 Gt C) are mainly marine, and bacteria (≈70 Gt C) and archaea (≈7 Gt C) are predominantly located in deep subsurface environments. We show that the global marine biomass pyramid contains more consumers than producers, thus increasing the scope of previous observations on inverse food pyramids.

Our model is continuous, in contrast to all known models of SOC, and is a certain scaling limit of the sandpile model, the first and archetypical model of SOC.

Our aim in this context is to present an idealized tropical toy model (cf. Turing reaction-diffusion model), requiring further investigation. We also discuss the relation between our model and the sandpile model. The sandpile model is a discrete model of SOC, while our model is a continuous model.

We also show that diamond can be demetallized, and its bandgap can be opened, by applying tensile strain. These findings offer opportunities for tailoring properties of diamond via strain engineering for electronic, photonic, and quantum applications.

Here, we use proteomics to characterize the posttesticular life history of the Drosophila sperm proteome and determine the extent of molecular continuity between male and female reproductive systems. We show that the sperm proteome undergoes substantial compositional changes after being transferred to the female reproductive tract. Multiple seminal fluid proteins initially associate with sperm, but most become undetectable after sperm are stored. Female-derived proteins also begin to associate with sperm immediately after mating, and they comprise nearly 20% of the postmating sperm proteome following 4 d of storage in the female reproductive tract. Female-derived proteins that associate with sperm are enriched for processes associated with energy metabolism, suggesting that female contributions support sperm viability during the prolonged period between copulation and fertilization.

The observations of aerosols and clouds using this instrument, verified by the Monte Carlo simulation and coincident observations of other techniques, highlight the scientific potential of dual-FOV HSRL to become a significant contributor to the ACI investigations. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI. This study also provides a case study of the ACI analysis over Beijing. The observed water cloud profiles identify that due to air entrainment its vertical structure is not perfectly adiabatic, as assumed by many current retrieval methods.

The ancestral environmental temperatures thereby determined for these photic-zone organisms––shown in modern taxa to correlate strongly with thermostability––are inferred to reflect ancient surface-environment paleotemperatures. Our results suggest that Earth’s surface temperature decreased over geological time from ∼65–80 °C in the Archean, a finding consistent both with previous isotope-based and protein reconstruction-based interpretations. Interdisciplinary studies such as those reported here integrating genomic, geologic, and paleontologic data hold promise for providing new insight into the coevolution of life and environment over Earth history.

K+ channels commonly possess two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We induced C-type inactivation in BK channels and studied the relationship between activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery. We observed prominent slow C-type inactivation/recovery in BK channels by an extreme low concentration of extracellular K+ together with a Y294E/K/Q/S or Y279F mutation whose equivalent in Shaker channels (T449E/K/D/Q/S or W434F) caused a greatly accelerated rate of C-inactivation or constitutive C-inactivation. C-type inactivation in most K+ channels occurs upon sustained membrane depolarization or channel opening and then recovers during hyperpolarized membrane potentials or channel closure. However, we found that the BK channel C-type inactivation occurred during hyperpolarized membrane potentials"

The malaria parasite erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 (EBA175) is required for parasite invasion in most parasite strains. Here, we show that EBA175 binding to glycophorin A (GPA) on the RBC surface leads to an increase in the cytoskeletal tension of the red cell and a reduction in the bending modulus of the cell’s membrane. We isolate the changes in the cytoskeleton and membrane and show that reduction in the bending modulus is directly correlated with parasite invasion efficiency. These data suggest that the malaria parasite primes the erythrocyte surface through its binding antigens, altering the biophysical nature of the target cell and thus reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion. This finding would constitute a major change in our concept of malaria parasite invasion, suggesting it is, in fact, a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces working together to facilitate entry. This study provides a new perspective on the malaria parasite invasion process. It also provides a potential target for the development of new antimalarial drugs.

It is a semiconductor with a large bandgap, but its electronic and optical properties are sensitive to defects and impurities. Here, we show that diamond can be metallized, solely under mechanical strain without phonon instability, so that its electronic bandgap fully vanishes. We also identify the pathway to metallization within six-dimensional strain space for different sample geometries. Our findings offer opportunities for tailoring properties of diamond via strain engineering for electronic, photonic, and quantum applications. This work also provides a general framework for exploring the phase diagram of diamond under strain.

In temperate regions, seasonal influenza outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in ambient humidity. However, the impact of humidity on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the impact of ambient humidity on influenza virus transmission and disease outcome. They also suggest that dry air may be a modifiable risk factor for influenza virus infection. Our study also provides a proof-of-concept for the development of humidity-"

However, whether and how the brain builds such structures remains largely unknown. Here, we used intracranial recordings to investigate how left-hemispheric brain activity varies during the formation of phrase structures. We found that high-gamma power increased with each successive word in a sentence but decreased suddenly whenever words could be merged into a phrase. This pattern of activity was consistent with a neural implementation of a bottom-up or left-corner parser of the incoming language stream. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases. This model of language processing may be a key to understanding the brain’s efficient and flexible use of language.

Axin is a key component that converts signals at the plasma membrane to signals inhibiting the degradation of β-catenin, leading to its accumulation and specific gene activation. We show here that differential regulation of the two forms of Axin confers differential responsiveness that can be used in tissue-specific regulation. Such subtle features may distinguish other redundant gene pairs that are commonly found in vertebrates through gene knockout experiments.

Electrical stimulation of LH GABA neurons causes vigorous eating in sated animals. We show that this effect is blocked by lesions of the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a major output region of LH GABA neurons. Lesions of the LH or peri-LH locus coeruleus (LC) GABA neurons also block eating. However, lesions of LH GABA terminals or LC GABA neurons do not alter body weight, suggesting that this circuit is not involved in the hunger or satiety mechanisms that govern normal feeding. Thus, we present a characterization of brain circuitry that may promote overeating and contribute to obesity. This circuit may be a target for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of obesity. This study also provides a model for the study of the role of dopamine in the regulation of feeding."

Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of controlling nitrogen fixation in bacteria in association with cereal plants. We developed a system in which the cereal plant produces a bacterial signal that controls the production of the bacterial nitrogenase. We used this system to control nitrogenase activity in bacteria colonizing cereal roots. Although nitrogenase activity was suboptimally effective relative to wild-type bacteria, activation was specific to cereal plants and was not observed on the roots of noncereal plants. This work represents a key milestone toward the development of a synthetic plant-controlled symbiosis in which the bacteria fix nitrogen only when in contact with the desired host plant and are prevented from interaction with nontarget plant species.

We study a community monitoring program that facilitated transfer of early deforestation alerts from the Global Forest Watch network to indigenous communities in the Peruvian Amazon and trained and incentivized community members to patrol forests in response to those alerts. The results from our analysis suggest that the program reduced tree cover loss, but the estimated effects from the experiment are imprecise. Community members perceived that the program’s monitors were new authorities with influence over forest management and that the monitors’ incentivized patrols were substitutes for traditional, unincentivized citizen patrols that suffer from free riding and inhibit timely community detection of and responses to deforestation. Should our findings be replicated elsewhere, they imply that externally facilitated community-based monitoring protocols that combine remote-sensed early deforestation alerts with training and incentives for monitors could contribute to sustainable forest management. This study is important because it provides evidence about how community-based monitoring protocols can be designed to contribute to sustainable forest management.

The auditory organs of these animals are extremely diverse in anatomy after hundreds of millions of years of evolution, yet all are made up of cellular tissue and are morphologically part of the bodies of animals. Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. We find that the wispy, wheel-shaped orb web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to capture the sound-induced air particle movements that approach the maximum physical efficiency better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By sensing the motion of web threads, the spider remotely detects and localizes the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave, such as those emitted by approaching prey or predators. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000"

We find that a phaseout of fossil-fuel-related emissions and major reductions of other anthropogenic sources can avoid an excess mortality rate of 3.61 (2.96–4.21) million per year from outdoor air pollution worldwide. This could be up to 5.55 (4.52–6.52) million per year by additionally controlling nonfossil anthropogenic sources. Globally, fossil-fuel-related emissions account for about 65% of the excess mortality, and 70% of the climate cooling by anthropogenic aerosols. The chemical influence of air pollution on aeolian dust contributes to the aerosol cooling. Since aerosols mask the anthropogenic rise in global temperature, removing fossil-fuel-generated particles liberates 0.51(±0.03) °C and all pollution particles 0.73(±0.03) °C warming, reaching around 2 °C over North America and Northeast Asia.

One of the main rewards plants offer to pollinators for visitation is nectar. Nesocodon mauritianus (Campanulaceae) produces a blood-red nectar that has been proposed to serve as a visual attractant for pollinator visitation. Here, we show that the nectar’s red color is derived from a previously undescribed alkaloid termed nesocodin. We identify a convergently evolved trait in two vertebrate-pollinated species, suggesting that the red pigment is selectively favored and that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation. This work cumulatively identifies a convergently evolved trait in two vertebrate-pollinated species, suggesting that the red pigment is selectively favored and that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation.

The individuals were selected to represent a broad range of social status and gender. Our data indicate that while men generally had ancestry that closely resembles modern northern and central Europeans, women exhibit a very high genetic heterogeneity; this includes signals of genetic ancestry ranging from western Europe to East Asia. Particularly striking are women with artificial skull deformations; the analysis of their collective genetic ancestry suggests an origin in southeastern Europe. In addition, functional variants revealed that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago. Our results indicate that complex demographic processes during the Early Medieval period may have contributed in an unexpected way to shape the modern European genetic landscape. Examination of the panel of functional loci also revealed that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago. Our results provide insights into the processes that shaped the modern European genetic landscape. This is particularly important in the context of the current debate on the role of migration in"

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. First, whereas MERS-CoV prefers human DPP4 over bat DPP4 as its receptor, HKU4 shows the opposite trend. Second, in the absence of exogenous proteases, both MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes mediate pseudovirus entry into bat cells, whereas only MERS-CoV spike, but not HKU4 spike, mediates pseudovirus entry into human cells. Thus, MERS-CoV, but not HKU4, has adapted to"

The stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. We designed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. We found that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the unique properties of the human lagging strand DNA polymerase holoenzyme. These findings also have implications for the design of therapeutic agents that target pol δ. Our results suggest that the loose association of pol δ with PCNA may be a desirable property for therapeutic agents that target pol δ.

In the hypothesized RNA world, before the evolution of proteins, genetic information was stored in RNA molecules that were replicated by RNA polymerases. In the laboratory, RNA polymerases have been used to synthesize RNA molecules, but the ability to replicate nucleic acids and to synthesize functional RNA molecules from scratch has been lacking. Here, we report the development of an RNA polymerase ribozyme that can replicate nucleic acids and synthesize functional RNA molecules from scratch. This RNA polymerase ribozyme can synthesize a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and, in low yield, even tRNA. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins. This work represents a major step toward the reconstruction of RNA-based life. The RNA polymerase ribozyme described here can be used to study the origin of life and to explore the potential of RNA-based life in the laboratory.

We connect changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities. Our results also suggest that the physical appearance of neighborhoods may be a useful indicator of the economic and demographic characteristics of the residents. This may have important implications for urban planning and policy. Our method may also be useful for other applications, such as monitoring the physical appearance of cities over time"

We show that the presence of high biliverdin in anurans (frogs and toads) has evolved multiple times during their evolutionary history, and relies on the same mechanism—the presence of a class of serpin family proteins that bind biliverdin. These proteins, hereafter named biliverdin-binding serpins (BBSs), are most similar to human glycoprotein alpha-1-antitrypsin, but with a remarkable functional diversification. Our results present molecular and functional evidence of recurrent evolution of chlorosis, describe a biliverdin-binding protein in vertebrates, and introduce a function for a member of the serpin superfamily, the largest and most ubiquitous group of protease inhibitors.

We show that hypoxia induces expression of AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), which demethylates N6-methyladenosine (m6A) on NANOG mRNA, a factor that encodes a breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) marker. ALKBH5 expression is induced by hypoxia through the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and HIF-2α pathways. ALKBH5-dependent m6A demethylation of NANOG mRNA increases NANOG protein levels and induces BCSCs. ALKBH5 expression in breast cancer cells increases their capacity to initiate tumors in immunodeficient mice. Thus, HIF-dependent ALKBH5 expression in hypoxic tumors promotes BCSC expansion. Our findings suggest that ALKBH5 may be a therapeutic target for breast cancer. This study also provides a mechanism for how hypoxia induces BCSCs.

The source of the parchment, often called “uterine vellum,” has been a long-standing controversy in codicology. The Latin term abortivum in many sources has led some scholars to suggest that fetal calves or sheep skins were used. Others have argued that it would not be possible to sustain herds if so many pocket Bibles were made from fetal skins, arguing instead for unexpected alternatives, such as rabbit. Here, we report a simple and objective method using standard conservation treatments to identify the animal origin of parchment. The noninvasive method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals. These results suggest that ultrafine vellum does not necessarily derive from the use of abortive or newborn animals with ultrathin hides, but could equally well reflect a production"

RORαΔIEC mice exhibit excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis reveals corecruitment of RORα and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) on NF-κB target promoters and subsequent dismissal of CREB binding protein (CBP) and bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) for transcriptional repression.

This pandemic is generally understood as the consequence of a singular introduction of Yersinia pestis, after which the disease established itself in European rodents over four centuries. To locate these putative plague reservoirs, we studied the climate fluctuations that preceded regional plague epidemics, based on a dataset of 7,711 georeferenced historical plague outbreaks and 15 annually resolved tree-ring records from Europe and Asia. We provide evidence for repeated climate-driven reintroductions of the bacterium into European harbors from reservoirs in Asia, with a delay of 15 ± 1 y.

We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

We synthesize the largest global dataset to date of soil respiration, moisture, and temperature measurements, totaling &gt;3,800 observations representing 27 temperature manipulation studies, spanning nine biomes and over 2 decades of warming. Our analysis reveals no significant differences in the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration between control and warmed plots in all biomes, with the exception of deserts and boreal forests. Thus, our data provide limited evidence of acclimation of soil respiration to experimental warming in several major biome types, contrary to the results from multiple single-site studies. Our analysis adds a unique cross-biome perspective on the temperature response of soil respiration, information critical to improving our mechanistic understanding of how soil carbon dynamics change with climatic warming. Our results suggest that soil respiration may be more responsive to warming in colder climates compared with warmer regions. This may have important implications for the global carbon cycle.

The transition from autotrophy to a nonphotosynthetic parasitic lifestyle is a major evolutionary event that has shaped the molecular evolution of plastid genomes. We present a model of the trajectory of plastid genome evolution during the transition from autotrophy to a nonphotosynthetic parasitic lifestyle. We show that relaxed purifying selection in all plastid genes is linked to obligate parasitism, characterized by the parasite’s dependence on a host to fulfill its life cycle, rather than the loss of photosynthesis. Our findings suggest that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner. During the functional reduction process, the elevation of evolutionary rates reaches several new rate equilibria, possibly relating to the modified protein turnover rates in heterotrophic plastids. This model can be used to infer the evolutionary history of the transition to obligate parasitism in the parasitic lineages of the plastid genomes.

We use a high-resolution large ensemble to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the probability of occurrence of multiyear rainfall deficits in southwestern South Africa. We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% by the year 2100 under an intermediate-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5 [SSP2-4.5]) and to 80% under a high-emission scenario (SSP5-8.5). These results highlight the strong sensitivity of the drought risk in SSA to future anthropogenic emissions. This work is a step towards quantifying the risk of future droughts in SSA. The high-resolution large ensemble used in this study can be used to study other extreme events. The methodology can be extended to other regions and climate variables. The results can be used to inform adaptation planning. The results can also be used to study

Photosynthesis relies on these modified tetrapyrroles for the capture of solar radiation and its conversion to chemical energy. The formation of the isocyclic fifth ring, the key reaction in the biosynthesis of (bacterio)chlorophylls, has remained enigmatic for more than 60 y. This reaction is catalyzed by two unrelated cyclase enzymes using different chemistries. The majority of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria use O2-sensitive [4Fe-4S] cluster proteins, whereas plants, cyanobacteria, and some phototrophic bacteria possess an O2-dependent enzyme, the major catalytic component of which is a diiron protein. Plant and cyanobacterial mutants in ycf54 display impaired function of the O2-dependent enzyme, accumulating the reaction substrate. Swapping cyclases between cyanobacteria and purple phototrophic bacteria reveals three classes of the O2-dependent enzyme.

Neuroinflammation is associated with the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) ASK1. However, the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms of ASK1 in neuroinflammation remain unknown. In this study, we generated conditional knockout (CKO) mice that lack ASK1 in T cells, dendritic cells, microglia/macrophages, microglia, or astrocytes. We found that ASK1 deficiency in microglia/macrophages and astrocytes ameliorated the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). ASK1 signaling in microglia/macrophages activated astrocytes to exacerbate neuroinflammation. Astrocyte-specific ASK1 deletion was achieved using a CX3CR1CreER system, and we found that ASK1-dependent astrocytes produced key inflammatory mediators, including CCL2, which further activated and recruited microglia/macrophages. Our findings suggest that glial ASK1 is a promising therapeutic target for reducing neuroinflammation. This study also provides a rationale for the use of CX3CR1 as a target for neuroinflammation.

The causal pathways that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility are still unknown. We used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. Our study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility in autism and suggests that the forgetting process is a potential therapeutic target for autism. This study also provides a framework for identifying the causal pathways that lead to the core autistic symptoms.

However, our understanding of the factors that contribute to virus spillover from bats is very limited. Here, we identified and characterized an immunosuppressant protein (MTX) that is highly concentrated in the submandibular salivary gland of the bat, Myotis pilosus. MTX selectively inhibits the epoxide hydrolase function of leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) to inhibit LTA4 hydrolysis and the generation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a potent lipid chemoattractant for host defense against infection. MTX potently inhibits proinflammatory proteases to induce immune tolerance and maintain high stability. In mouse models, influenza A virus (IAV) infection and pathogenicity were exacerbated by MTX but were reversed by interfering with the effects of MTX on LTA4H or exogenous LTB4 administration.

Here we show that dual SHMT knockout blocks colon cancer tumor growth. We identify small-molecule dual inhibitors of human SHMT1/2. We show that formate, a one-carbon donor, rescues cells from SHMT inhibition, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We show that this effect is rooted in defective glycine import in DLBCL cell lines, rendering them uniquely dependent upon SHMT enzymatic activity to meet glycine demand. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of DLBCL. These findings suggest that targeting SHMT in cancer may be a viable strategy for colon cancer, but not for DLBCL.

We present 10 ancient parvovirus B19V genomes (∼0.5–6.9 kya) from dental and skeletal remains of individuals who lived in Eurasia and Greenland. The most recent common ancestor of all B19V is placed ∼12.6 kya, and we find a substitution rate that is an order of magnitude lower than inferred previously. Further, we are able to date the recombination event between genotypes 1 and 3 that formed genotype 2 to ∼5.0–6.8 kya. This study emphasizes the importance of ancient viral sequences for our understanding of virus evolution and phylogenetics. The oldest B19V sequence is ∼70 years old, and the most recent common ancestor of all B19V has been dated to the early 1800s. This suggests that B19V has been circulating for at least 200"

This pattern is not explained by changes in occupation or levels of obesity. If this trend continues, pain prevalence will continue to increase for all adults, with potentially serious implications for healthcare. We suggest that the erosion of working-class life for those born after 1950 may be reflected in the erosion of working-class pain. This erosion may be a major contributor to the opioid crisis.

However, the mechanisms by which this is achieved are poorly understood. Here, we show that the squid Euprymna scolopes regulates the activities of its luminescent symbiont, Vibrio fischeri, by the strategic delivery of a single glycan, chitin. Chitin is released by host-derived immune cells just before dusk, when the organ containing the symbiont is at its most stable. The chitin is catabolized by the symbiont, which is then able to maintain a high population level and produce bioluminescence at night. This glycan-nutrient delivery system may be used by other animal hosts to regulate the activities of their symbiotic microbes. Understanding the mechanisms by which animals maintain stable relationships with their microbes is critical for the development of strategies to control microbial diseases. This study also provides a mechanism for the evolution of host-specific symbionts.

In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We found that pol II stalling at O2-EtdT and N3-EtdT sites is exacerbated by TFIIS-stimulated proofreading activity. Assessment for the impact of the EtdT lesions on individual fidelity checkpoints provided further mechanistic insights, where the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into endosomes."

We find that each oncogene has somewhat different surfaceomes, but the functions of these proteins are harmonized by common biological themes including up-regulation of nutrient transporters, down-regulation of adhesion molecules and tumor suppressing phosphatases, and alteration in immune modulators. Addition of a potent MEK inhibitor that blocks MAPK signaling brings each oncogene-induced surfaceome back to a common state reflecting the strong dependence of the oncogene on the MAPK pathway to propagate signaling.

The genome of the virus is segmented into eight fragments, which complicates genomic packaging. The selective packaging of viral RNA into virions is a fundamental process in all viruses, but the molecular details of this process are unknown. Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus. This interaction is required for optimal viral replication and favors the copackaging of the interacting viral RNA segments. Our results indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions. The lack of conservation of these interactions might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses. This study provides a molecular understanding of the selective packaging of viral RNA into virions. This knowledge is essential for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs against influenza A viruses. This work also provides a molecular understanding of the packaging of RNA in general. The existence of a selective packaging mechanism, in which one copy of each viral RNA is specifically packaged into each virion, is suspected, but its molecular details remain unknown.

The vascular environment, including hemodynamic forces, is believed to play an important role in the development of atheroprone phenotypes and the progression of atherosclerosis. However, the mechanisms by which the vascular environment regulates the atheroprone phenotypes and the consequential development of atherosclerotic lesions remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the activation of Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) by disturbed flow is critical for the development of atheroprone phenotypes and atherosclerotic lesion development.

However, human activities have greatly increased the spatial and seasonal extent of wildfire in the United States. This increase has been driven by the expansion of the fire niche, which is the combination of climate conditions and fuel conditions that support wildfire. The human-caused fire niche has expanded by 100-fold since 1992, and the human-caused fire season is three times longer than the lightning-caused fire season. The human-started fire season is expanding at a faster rate than the lightning-started fire season, and human-started wildfires are now dominant across the United States. Actions to reduce the risk of wildfire and associated hazards should focus on reducing the human-caused fire niche.

We connect changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

While the symptoms and consequences of this breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis have been extensively characterized, our understanding of the underlying causes remains incomplete. Here, we show that altered nutrient cycling during heat stress is a primary driver of the functional breakdown of the symbiosis. Heat stress increased the metabolic energy demand of the coral host, which was compensated by the catabolic degradation of amino acids. The resulting shift from net uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont subsequently promoted the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host. Energy limitation and altered symbiotic nutrient cycling are thus key factors in the early heat stress response, directly contributing to the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis. Interpreting the stability of the coral holobiont in light of its metabolic interactions provides a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

This DLK-independent regeneration is triggered by physical lesion of a sensory dendrite or mutations disrupting sensory activity, calcium signaling, or genes that restrict outgrowth during neuronal maturation. These connections suggest that ectopic outgrowth represents a powerful platform for gene discovery in neuronal regeneration. Moreover, we note numerous similarities between DLK-independent outgrowth and lesion conditioning, a phenomenon producing robust regeneration in the mammalian CNS.

Fibrous sheath interacting protein 1 (FSIP1) is a cancer antigen expressed in the majority of TNBCs and is associated with poor prognosis. However, the role of FSIP1 in TNBC progression and drug sensitivity has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. Thus, our study provides a rationale for targeting FSIP"

The present study shows that some alcohol-dependent subjects develop gut leakiness, which is associated with higher scores of depression, anxiety, and alcohol craving after 3 wk of abstinence. Moreover, subjects with increased gut permeability also had altered composition and activity of the gut microbiota. These results suggest the existence of a gut–brain axis in alcohol dependence, which implicates the gut microbiota as an actor in the gut barrier and in behavioral disorders. Thus, the gut microbiota seems to be a previously unidentified target in the management of alcohol dependence.

These species are valuable genetic resources for understanding the evolution of fruit traits, but the underlying genetic control of fruit traits is not fully understood. Here we report the identification of a locus that is essential for the production of all the detectable nitrogenous volatiles in tomato fruit.

However, these factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we use high-throughput experiments to investigate how changes in temperature affect the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We found that changes in temperature systematically altered the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures departed from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increased, meaning that more species were required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function.

Here, we used portable two-photon microscopes to examine the topographic arrangement of spatially modulated neurons in the superficial layers of MEC and adjacent parasubiculum during unrestrained behavior. We found that grid cells exhibited low levels of co-occurrence with OV cells and clustered anatomically, while border, HD, and OV cells tended to intermingle. These data suggest that grid cell networks might be largely distinct from those of border, HD, and OV cells. Grid cells exhibit strong coupling among themselves but weaker links to other cell types. Our findings provide a framework for understanding the organization of grid cell networks. They also suggest that grid cells may be more similar to HD cells than previously thought.

We demonstrate that striatonigral fibers originating in striosomes form highly unusual bouquet-like arborizations that target bundles of ventrally extending dopamine-containing dendrites and clusters of their parent nigral cell bodies. These clustered cell bodies in turn project to the striatum as part of the classic nigrostriatal pathway. Thus, these striosome–dendron bouquets likely represent subsystems with the nigro–striato–nigral loop that are affected in human disorders including Parkinson’s disease.

For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Finally, we demonstrate that this signal is used by third-party listeners as a heuristic of how well people are connected: Conversations with faster response times were perceived as more connected than the same conversations with slower response times. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.” This work provides a new way to measure and understand the quality of social connection.

We show that RSPO certification reduced tropical forest loss in Indonesia by 33% from 2001 to 2015. However, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results suggest that certification is not a silver bullet for tropical deforestation, but it is an important tool in the toolbox of policies to reduce tropical deforestation. Our findings also highlight the importance of monitoring and enforcement of certification requirements. Our results are based on a comprehensive dataset of oil palm plantations in Indonesia, the leading producer of palm oil. Our findings are relevant to other commodities and regions where certification is used to reduce tropical deforestation.

In humans, its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. Investigation of the dynamic regulation of the evolutionarily conserved exocyst-related processes using mutants in genetically tractable organisms such as Arabidopsis thaliana is limited by the lethality or the severity of phenotypes. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 (exocyst component of 70 kDa) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and offers a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease.

In many species, sex is determined by a single locus, but in others, multiple sex determination alleles interact to produce more than two genotypic sexes. Here we investigate the effects of polygenic sex determination in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii, where two alleles (W and Y) interact to produce four possible sex classes: ZZXX females, ZWXX females, ZWXY females, and ZZXY males. We find that polygenic sex determination can produce modular variation in morphological and behavioral traits, and that the evolution or introgression of a newly acquired sex determiner creates additional axes of variation for varied traits. These results provide context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations. Understanding the evolutionary history of sex determination is critical for predicting the effects of anthropogenic climate change and habitat fragmentation on species distributions.

We sought to understand how Fe levels impact the retina, given that retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are also challenged by accumulations of bisretinoids. We found that intracellular Fe promotes bisretinoid oxidation and degradation. This interpretation was supported by experiments showing that Fe chelation decreased the oxidative/degradation of the bisretinoid A2E in the presence of light and reduced cell death in cell-based experiments. Moreover, light-independent oxidation and degradation of A2E by Fenton chemistry products were evidenced by the consumption of A2E, release of dicarbonyls, and generation of oxidized A2E species in cell-free assays. These findings indicate that Fe is a key regulator of bisretinoid metabolism. This work provides a mechanistic understanding of the role of Fe in the retina and may lead to the development of therapeutic strategies to protect the retina from the damaging effects of bisretinoids. This work also provides a rationale for the use of Fe chelators in the treatment of age-related"

They are a highly specialized group of predators, with only a few species feeding on a single prey type. This specialization is often considered an evolutionary dead end, but we show that siphonophores can evolve into generalists and that specialists on one prey type can evolve into specialists on other prey types. Our results suggest that shifts between prey types are linked to shifts in the morphology, mode of evolution, and evolutionary correlations of tentilla and their nematocysts. These findings contribute to understanding how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs. They also help build a broader perspective on predatory niche diversification via morphological innovation and evolution. This study contributes to the understanding of the evolution of specialization and morphological evolution. It also contributes to the understanding of the evolution of food webs.

The fossil record for the evolution of the hand between 800,000 and 1.8 My old is sparse, and the oldest hominin hand fossils are incomplete. We report the discovery of a hand fossil from the Middle Pleistocene (1.42 My old) that preserves the third metacarpal styloid process, a key derived feature of the modern human hand. This fossil provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of this key derived feature and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato. This study also highlights the importance of East African fossil sites for understanding the evolution of the human hand. This fossil is from the Kaitio site, which has been the focus of recent excavations by the Turkana Basin Institute. The site is located in the Turkana Basin, Kenya, which is a key site for understanding the evolution of the human fossil record. The Turkana Basin is one of the most intensively studied fossil sites in the world, and the site has produced a number"

Mammalian cells have two SHMT isozymes, cytosolic SHMT1 and mitochondrial SHMT2. Cancer cells have elevated mitochondrial SHMT2, which is strongly up-regulated in colon cancer. Here we show that dual SHMT knockout blocks colon cancer tumor growth. We identify small-molecule dual inhibitors of human SHMT1/2. We show that formate, a one-carbon donor, rescues cells from SHMT inhibition, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We show that this effect is rooted in defective glycine import in DLBCL cell lines, rendering them uniquely dependent upon SHMT enzymatic activity to meet glycine demand. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of DLBCL. These findings suggest that targeting SHMT in cancer may be a viable strategy for colon cancer, but not for DLBCL. This is a first step toward developing a metabolically targeted cancer therapy. This work also provides a proof-of-concept for the use of formate as a one-carbon donor in cancer therapy."

In this study, we show that deforestation can have negative impacts on people’s diets and dietary vitamin A adequacy. We also show that forest fragmentation can have positive impacts on people’s diets and dietary vitamin A adequacy. These findings have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals.
