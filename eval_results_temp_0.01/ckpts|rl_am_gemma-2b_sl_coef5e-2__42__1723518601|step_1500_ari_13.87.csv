The guest atoms can be enclathrated in water molecules to form hydrate, which is of great significance for understanding the structure of hydrate with guest atoms. This work provides a new way to study the structure of hydrate with guest atoms."

In this paper we provide a purely categorical approach to the foundations of quantum theory. The axioms are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. This addresses a question about the mathematical foundations of quantum theory raised in reconstruction programs such as those of von Neumann, Mackey, Jauch, Piron, Abramsky, and Coecke. The approach is based on the notion of a category of functions, which is a generalisation of the notion of a function between sets. The category of Hilbert spaces and bounded linear operators is shown to be equivalent to the category of continuous linear functions between the appropriate categories of functions. This provides a mathematical foundation for the theory of quantum measurement. The approach is also applicable to other areas of mathematics, such as the theory of Banach spaces and operator algebras."

Although the evolutionary origin of the myxozoan body plan has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we report the results of a comparative analysis of the genomes of two myxozoans and a cnidarian parasite. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. These results have implications for understanding the evolution of the parasitic lifestyle. (Read more)"

The disease is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus has a high mutation rate and is constantly evolving, which makes it difficult to develop effective vaccines and antiviral drugs. In this study, we identified a mechanism of viral antagonism that is used by SARS-CoV-2 to overcome the antiviral action of interferon (IFN). We show that the virus is able to hijack the nuclear import machinery and block the nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, which are key factors in the IFN signaling pathway. Our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism that is used by SARS-CoV-2 to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This mechanism could be used as a target for the development of new antiviral drugs. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of the proton channel. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric channel. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on the channel: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits the channel will further our understanding of the channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for the channel.

This study quantifies the impact of climate change on maize production and yields, and the impact of climate change on the stability of maize production and yields, in the major maize-producing and -exporting countries. We find that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields will increase to values much larger than present-day values in the major maize-producing countries. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields. The probability that the major maize-exporting countries have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes."

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level differences in consumption of individual plant species. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species of large herbivores in semiarid African savanna. We found that, despite being similar in body size, digestive physiology, and location, all species consumed a range of plant species, and that dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This study highlights the need to consider the full range of species in studies of niche partitioning and coexistence, and to consider the potential for species to coexist even when they are highly similar in resource use. This is particularly important in light of the current global trend toward the loss of biodiversity."

We show that the predicted best candidate is more active than telithromycin, the current standard of care, and is up to 56 times more active against resistant pathogens than telithromycin. Notably, the best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

Here, we report a novel role for APOE in the regulation of the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes, which is highly dependent on APOE isoform. We also found that APOE alleles affect the rate of accumulation of senescent synapses in the brain, which may contribute to the increased vulnerability of APOE4 to complement-mediated neurodegeneration. These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes. They also suggest the hypothesis that AD susceptibility of APOE4 may originate in part from defective phagocytic capacity of astrocytes which accelerates the rate of accumulation of senescent synapses, enhancing synaptic vulnerability to complement-mediated neurodegeneration.

However, the mechanism by which it does so is not well understood. Here, we show that the action of ADF is enhanced by a mechanical torque that it generates upon binding to the filament. This mechanism is critical to the function of ADF in cells, where filaments are highly interconnected and under mechanical stress. Our findings have implications for our understanding of the role of mechanical stress in the action of ADF in cells. They also have implications for our understanding of the role of mechanical stress in the action of ADF in other contexts, such as in vitro."

However, the complexity of ACI makes it difficult to be well represented in current climate models. The main reason is that the observational capability is inadequate. To overcome this conundrum, we introduce the dual-field-of-view (FOV) high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) for simultaneously profiling aerosol and water cloud properties, especially water cloud microphysical properties. This instrument, verified by the Monte Carlo simulation and coincident observations of other techniques, was used to conduct a case study over Beijing. The observations show that the increased aerosol loading led to increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius—consistent with expectations—but had no discernible increase on liquid water path. This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations obtained from the dual-FOV HSRL constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI process. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The temperature history of the surface is inferred from the isotopic compositions of marine cherts, but this interpretation has been subject to question due to uncertainties regarding oceanic isotopic compositions, diagenetic or metamorphic resetting of the isotopic record, and depositional environments. We here present thermostability measurements of ancestral enzymes, which provide an independent method by which to assess the temperature history inferred from the isotopic evidence. Our results suggest that Earth’s surface temperature decreased over geological time from ∼65–80 °C in the Archean, a finding consistent both with previous isotope-based and protein reconstruction-based interpretations. Interdisciplinary studies such as those reported here integrating genomic, geologic, and paleontologic data hold promise for providing new insight into the coevolution of life and environment over Earth history.

Ion channels are also involved in a variety of diseases, such as epilepsy, cardiac arrhythmia, and hypertension. The pore gates of ion channels are the main sites of ion flow regulation. We studied the relationship between the activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery of the K+ channel BK. We found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. This study provides a new perspective on the regulation of ion flow and the development of new drugs for diseases involving ion channels. (Read more)"

We show that metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is a feasible, cost-effective, and resource-efficient approach to identify the cause of undifferentiated febrile illness in a resource-scarce setting. We demonstrate that mNGS can identify a variety of vector-borne, zoonotic, and emerging pathogens, including chikungunya virus, which presaged a national outbreak. We also show that mNGS can identify pathogens that are not included in the clinical workflow, such as Plasmodium knowlesi, which is a zoonotic pathogen that can cause severe disease in humans. These findings have implications for the early detection of emerging pathogens, and for the development of mNGS-based surveillance systems in resource-scarce settings. This approach can be used to identify the pathogen landscape in other settings, and to develop mNGS-based surveillance systems."

Here, we show that the provision of a single glycan, chitin, is sufficient to maintain the health of a symbiont in a light-producing organ of a squid. We also show that the glycan is provided and metabolized only at night, when the squid is active and the organ is colonized by the symbionts. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the regulation of the activities of symbionts in the environment, and may also have implications for the health of the host.

There is an urgent need for novel and more efficient therapies, ideally targeting AML stem cells that are essential for maintaining the disease. We show here that monoclonal antibodies targeting the IL1RAP (IL1R3) receptor on candidate leukemic stem cells in the majority of AML patients have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The RNA encodes a 28-amino acid protein that increases the activity of aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. We also show that the RNA also encodes a protein that interferes with the ability of the RNA to repress genes. This demonstrates that the translation and base-pairing functions of the RNA compete. This is an example of a mechanism that has evolved to control the expression of genes. This work provides insight into the evolution of the dual-function RNA. It also provides a model for how the protein encoded by the RNA may function. This model may be useful in the future development of antibiotics that target the protein encoded by the RNA."

These proteins form characteristic inclusions in the brain and spinal cord, and the presence of these inclusions is a hallmark of the disease. However, the proteins that form inclusions are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. Rather, the inclusions contain a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. This study provides a new perspective on the pathogenesis of ALS, and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies. (PsycINFO Database Record"

Instead, the origin of the flowering plants in a darkened forest is based upon a few isolated fossils. Here, we present a detailed study of Montsechia, a Cretaceous flowering plant that lived and reproduced below the surface of the water.

The packaging of the viral genome is a key step in the assembly of the virions, and the existence of a selective packaging mechanism, in which one copy of each viral RNA is specifically packaged into each virion, is suspected. However, the molecular details of this mechanism remain unknown. Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus. We demonstrated that this interaction takes place in infected cells and is required for optimal viral replication. Disruption of this interaction decreased the amount of viral RNA in the viral particles, resulting in an eightfold increase in empty viral particles. Our experiments indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions.

The development of atherosclerotic lesions is a complex process that involves a series of events, including the activation of proatherosclerotic phenotypes of vascular endothelial cells. The objective of this study is to identify the mechanisms that regulate the development of atherosclerotic lesions. We found that the activation of Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) is a critical event in the development of atheroprone phenotypes of vascular endothelial cells. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of the role of YAP/TAZ in the development of atherosclerotic lesions and suggest a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of atherosclerosis. This study also provides a rationale for the use of statin, an antiatherosclerotic drug, in the treatment of atherosclerosis. (PsycINFO Database Record"

We show that humans have vastly expanded the geographic and seasonal extent of wildfire in the United States, accounting for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. We also show that human-caused wildfires disproportionally occurred where fuel moisture was higher than lightning-caused fires, thereby helping expand the geographic and seasonal niche of wildfire. Our findings highlight the need to raise awareness and increase management in regions prone to human-started wildfires to reduce fire risk and associated hazards."

We use this method to study the physical dynamics of five US cities over the course of 10 years. We find that neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

Furthermore, we show that treatment of mice bearing breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) with the humanized anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab and paclitaxel is more effective than treatment with either alone in eradicating PDXs.

Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

Thus, the striosome–dendron bouquets likely represent subsystems with the nigro–striato–nigral loop that are affected in human disorders including Parkinson’s disease. Within the bouquets, striosomal fibers are found to be tightly intertwined with the dopamine-containing dendrites and also with other types of neurons and fibers. We suggest that the striosome–dendron bouquets are critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease."

But how do we know when two people are connected? We asked people to talk with each other and then rated the felt connection. We found that the speed at which people responded to each other was a robust predictor of felt connection. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results highlight the importance of certification in the context of a rapidly expanding global palm oil industry. Our findings also highlight the need for more rigorous evaluation of the effectiveness of certification schemes in reducing tropical deforestation. This is particularly important in light of the recent announcement by the RSPO that it will no longer certify new palm oil plantations.

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants."
