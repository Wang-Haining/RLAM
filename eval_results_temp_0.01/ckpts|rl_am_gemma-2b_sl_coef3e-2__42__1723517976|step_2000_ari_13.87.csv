Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. (Show more)"

These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

However, the extent to which species differ in their food-plant preferences is largely unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level differences in food consumption. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify the food-plant preferences of seven species of large African herbivores, and found that the degree of overlap in food-plant preferences was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, species differed in their food-plant preferences, and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These findings suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages, and that the diversity of large herbivores may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized."

A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals.

This is due to the fact that bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to the existing antibiotics. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new strategies to combat this problem. In this work, we present a rational design approach to develop new acylide antibiotics. The design strategy is based on the prediction of the solubility, the binding affinity to the ribosome, and the membrane permeability of the compounds. The best candidate was tested in vitro and in vivo, and it was found to be active against resistant pathogens. This work is a step forward in the development of new antibiotics. It is expected that the design strategy presented here will be useful for the development of new acylide antibiotics. This will help to combat the problem of antibiotic resistance."

This work provides a new perspective on the invasion process, suggesting that the parasite and host cell are working together to facilitate entry. This is a major change in our understanding of the invasion process and may lead to the development of new strategies to combat this disease. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that housing mice in low humidity increases the severity of influenza virus infection. We find that low humidity impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide insights into the role of humidity in the severity of influenza virus infection. They also suggest that the impact of ambient humidity on the severity of influenza virus infection may depend on the host defense and repair capacity of the host. These findings may help to develop strategies to mitigate the severity of influenza virus infection. (Show more)"

This merge operation is applied equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity, providing evidence for a merge mechanism that applies to the brain’s representation of language. Our results suggest that the brain uses a bottom-up or left-corner parser to build syntactic structures.

We have developed a synthetic plant-controlled symbiosis in which the bacteria fix nitrogen only when in contact with the desired host plant and are prevented from interaction with nontarget plant species. This work represents a key milestone toward the development of a synthetic plant-controlled symbiosis in which the bacteria fix N2 only when in contact with the desired host plant and are prevented from interaction with nontarget plant species.

We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

We also show that the catabolism of this glycan is required for the maintenance of the symbiosis. These results suggest that the provision of specific nutrients may be a general mechanism for the control of the activities of symbionts in animal-microbe interactions.

To better understand the role of the spike (S) glycoproteins in MERS-CoV infection, we introduced mutations that blocked the sequential proteolysis required for virus entry. These mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence."

The unique nanosized and metastable characters of the proposed material are responsible for the high capacity and the safe operation of the full cell. This work combines a high capacity with a safe negative electrode material through delivering the Mo-based oxide with unique nanosized and metastable characters.

The photoreceptor-generated ROS are quenched by the RPE, but the RPE is challenged by the RPE-generated ROS, which are not quenched. We show that the levels of iron in the retina impact the balance between the photoreceptor and RPE-generated ROS."

However, the evolution of predator specialization is often considered a dead end, due to the constraints associated with the evolution of morphological and functional optimizations throughout the organism. Here we show that the evolution of predator specialization is not a dead end, but rather a process that has led to the diversification of the feeding strategies of the animal kingdom."

The study of the human hand is complicated by the fact that it is the most complex part of the body, and the fossil record is sparse and fragmentary. We present the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key shared derived characteristic of modern human and Neandertal hand morphology."

We have developed a small-molecule inhibitor of SHMT, and show that it is effective in inhibiting colon cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. We also show that the one-carbon donor, formate, is a potent rescue of SHMT inhibition, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We propose that defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. This work provides a new target for cancer therapy, and a potential mechanism for the differential sensitivity of B-cell lines and lymphomas to SHMT inhibition. This work also provides a new scaffold for the development of small-molecule inhibitors of SHMT. (Show more)"

This study shows that natural landscapes, such as forests, can contribute to meeting these goals. The results have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We hypothesize that the roaming of sauropods, the largest animals that walked Earth, would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This study highlights the importance of considering the effects of modern farm machinery on soil ecology and the need for more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. This will allow for the continued expansion of food production while minimizing the risks of subsoil compaction."
