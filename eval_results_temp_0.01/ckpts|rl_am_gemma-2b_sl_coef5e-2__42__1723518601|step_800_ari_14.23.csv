In this paper, we provide a purely categorical approach to quantum theory. The axioms are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. This approach provides a framework in which the mathematical structure of quantum theory is transparent and easy to understand."

Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we present the first genome assembly of a myxozoan parasite and compare it to the genome of a cnidarian parasite. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content.

In this study, we show that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 to impair nuclear import. We also show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its ability to block nuclear import.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

Meeting the food demand of this population will become increasingly challenging as the Earth’s climate continues to warm. Earlier studies suggest that once the optimum growing temperature is exceeded, mean crop yields decline and the variability of yield increases even if interannual climate variability remains unchanged. Here, we use global datasets of maize production and climate variability combined with future temperature projections to quantify how yield variability will change in the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. We find that as the global mean temperature increases, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation (CV) of maize yields increases almost everywhere to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation (SD) of yields and a decrease in mean yields. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes.

These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results also highlight the importance of plant diversity in determining the extent to which LMH partition food resources.

The most common drugs for treating hypertension are L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs), which are associated with heart failure. Here, we show that LCCBs activate STIM/ORAI-mediated Ca2+ entry in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which is required for the development of vascular remodeling. Our data indicate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. Our findings may help to explain the association of LCCBs with heart failure and may lead to the development of new strategies for the treatment of hypertension."

The development of new antibacterial agents is essential to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. In this work, we present a rational design approach to identify new acylide antibiotics that are active against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. The design strategy is based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. We show that the best candidate is more active than telithromycin, a clinically used antibiotic, and that it is up to 56 times more active against resistant pathogens than telithromycin. Notably, the best compounds designed by us show activity against three of the most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice, and automatically adapts to different problems. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data."

We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1 may act as a tumor suppressor in some settings.

ADF/cofilin is involved in a wide range of cellular processes, including cell migration, cytokinesis, and vesicle trafficking. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever actin filaments are not well understood. Here, we show that ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever actin filaments is enhanced by a mechanical torque. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. Our results provide a molecular explanation for how ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever actin filaments is enhanced in a physiological context, where filaments are interconnected and under mechanical stress. Our findings also suggest that this mechanism could be used to design new types of biomaterials that are able to sever themselves upon contact with cells. This article is protected by copyright.

We demonstrate that Aβ-burdened neurons are the primary source of cytokines that mobilize microglia, and that this response is vulnerable in the human brain. Thus, we propose that the Aβ-burdened neuron is a primary source of the inflammatory response that leads to neuronal death and the formation of amyloid plaques in AD. This neuron-specific inflammatory response may be a vulnerability in the human brain that contributes to the disease progression.

In bacteria, they function as precursors to nucleoside tetraphosphate (Np4) RNA caps, which are required for rapid degradation of the capped transcripts. The predominant Np4 decapping enzyme in proteobacteria, ApaH, is inactivated by the very conditions of disulfide stress that enable Np4-capped RNAs to accumulate to high levels. Here, we show that, in cells experiencing such stress, the pyrophosphohydrolase RppH assumes a leading role in decapping those transcripts, preferring them as substrates over their triphosphorylated and diphosphorylated counterparts. The unique manner in which capped substrates of this kind bind to the active site of RppH positions the δ-phosphate, rather than the β-phosphate, for hydrolytic attack, generating triphosphorylated RNA as the primary product of decapping. This study reveals a mechanism for how a bacterial stress response can be hijacked to alter the decay rate of a specific class of transcripts."

Mutations in VWF cause the common bleeding disorder, von Willebrand disease (VWD). We show that force application switches VWF to a second state with faster on-rate, providing a mechanism for activating VWF binding to platelets. This mechanism is important for the pathophysiology of VWD. The force-induced conformational change is reversible, with the same force that converts the receptor to the second state also inducing a state with slower off-rate. The force-induced changes in VWF are quantitatively similar to those in the bulk phase, suggesting that the force-induced changes are important for the function of VWF. This work provides a mechanism for the effects of mutations in VWF. It also provides a quantitative description of the effects of force on biological systems.

The observations of aerosols and clouds using this instrument, verified by the Monte Carlo simulation and coincident observations of other techniques, were conducted to investigate the interactions between aerosol loading and water cloud microphysical properties. A case study over Beijing highlights the scientific potential of dual-FOV HSRL to become a significant contributor to the ACI investigations.

Here we present a method for determining the temperature of Earth’s surface based on the thermostability of ancestral enzymes. The results obtained from ancestral enzymes are consistent with the temperature inferred from isotopic evidence.

We studied the K+ channel KCNMA1, which is mutated in long-QT syndrome type 2. We found that the KCNMA1 channel has two gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. We propose that the KCNMA1 channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. This study provides a framework for understanding the function of K+ channels and their diseases. It also provides a basis for the development of new drugs for arrhythmia.

We found that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

This merge operation is consistent with the hypothesis that the brain first builds phrases and then merges them into larger structures. Our results provide initial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases.

We present a genome-wide analysis of a sample of 11 individuals from Bavaria, Germany, who died mostly between 450 and 650 AD. Our results indicate that the genetic ancestry of men is mostly consistent with modern northern and central Europeans, while women exhibit a very high genetic heterogeneity; this includes signals of genetic ancestry ranging from western Europe to East Asia. In addition, we found that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago. These results suggest that complex demographic processes during the Early Medieval period may have contributed in an unexpected way to shape the modern European genetic landscape."

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions. Our findings are important for understanding the origin and evolution of MERS-CoV and for developing effective countermeasures against future zoonotic outbreaks. This article is"

In this study, we use a combination of biochemical and biophysical techniques to study the activity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. We find that the human pol δ holoenzyme is more stable than its S. cerevisiae counterpart and that the stability of the holoenzyme is not dependent on the activity of the sliding clamp. We also find that the human pol δ holoenzyme is more processive than its S. cerevisiae counterpart and that the processivity of the holoenzyme is dependent on the activity of the sliding clamp.

We find that, although climate change has already warmed the global fire regime, recent and predicted future reductions in fire activity may offset this warming. This potentially reduces warming by up to 0.11 °C by 2100. We show that ignitions and active and passive fire suppression can be as important in driving future fire regimes as changes in climate, although with some risk of more extreme fires regionally and with implications for other ecosystem functions in fire-dependent ecosystems.

This glycan is released by the squid’s immune cells just before dusk, a behavior that is established only in the mature symbiosis.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility, which resulted from the inability to forget. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

This work reports on a 17-country, 6-continent experiment that examines the extent to which people around the world react more strongly to negative than positive news content. Results show that, on average, people react more strongly to negative than positive news content, and that this negativity bias is present in a wide variety of countries and cultures. The results also highlight considerable individual-level variation in responsiveness to news content, suggesting that the conventional wisdom that “if it bleeds, it leads” may not be entirely accurate."

Here, we identify gain-of-function mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of STIM1 and in the pore-forming protein ORAI1, which result in hematological abnormalities and muscle dysfunction, respectively. These data expand our understanding of the phenotypic spectrum of dysregulated SO channel signaling, suggest new therapies aiming at attenuating store-operated Ca2+ entry in the treatment of patients with Stormorken syndrome and related pathologic conditions, and advance our knowledge of the molecular function of the SO channel.

However, the factors that contribute to virus spillover from bats are largely unknown. Here, we identified and characterized a protein that is highly concentrated in the submandibular salivary gland of the bat, Myotis pilosus, and demonstrated that this protein, named MTX, is a potent immunosuppressant that inhibits leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) to inhibit leukotriene B4 (LTB4) generation and the antiviral immune response. MTX exacerbated influenza A virus (IAV) infection and pathogenicity in mice, and this effect was reversed by interfering with the effects of MTX on LTA4H or exogenous LTB4 administration. This study provides deeper insight into immunologically privileged sites for microbial community residence in bats and supports the therapeutic potential of targeting MTX-LTA4H. This study also provides a potential mechanism for the emergence of zoonotic viruses from bats.</i>"

CRF acts on the cerebral cortex via its receptor CRFR1 to trigger signaling of cAMP/PKA in astrocytes, leading to activation of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and cerebral edema. These findings provide insights into the pathophysiology of cerebral edema and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies. This article is protected by copyright.

The genome of influenza A viruses is segmented into eight fragments, which complicates the packaging process. The selective packaging of the viral genome is a fundamental process in virus replication, but its molecular details remain unknown. Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus. This interaction is required for optimal viral replication and favors the copackaging of the interacting viral RNA segments. Our results indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions. The lack of conservation of these interactions might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses. This study provides a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome.

Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. This article is protected by copyright.

The biological mechanisms involved in the development of the disease are still poorly understood. In this study, we found that some, but not all, alcohol-dependent subjects developed gut leakiness, which was associated with higher scores of depression, anxiety, and alcohol craving after 3 wk of abstinence. Moreover, subjects with increased gut permeability also had altered composition and activity of the gut microbiota. These results suggest the existence of a gut–brain axis in alcohol dependence, which implicates the gut microbiota as an actor in the gut barrier and in behavioral disorders. Thus, the gut microbiota seems to be a previously unidentified target in the management of alcohol dependence. This study also provides a possible explanation for the high prevalence of psychiatric disorders in alcoholic patients. This study may also help to understand the pathophysiology of the disease and to develop new therapeutic strategies."

However, these factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. Our findings have important implications for our ability to predict the impacts of climate change on ecosystem functioning. They also highlight the need to consider the full range of biodiversity loss and environmental warming effects on ecosystem functioning in order to understand the full extent of the threat they pose."

However, the anatomical organization of the grid cells and their connections with other neurons in the superficial layers is not well understood. Here, we used a portable two-photon microscope to record the activity of neurons in the superficial layers of MEC during free-running behavior. We found that grid cells are anatomically organized, and their connections with other neurons are different from those of other neurons. These findings provide a detailed view of the organization of grid cells and their connections in the superficial layers of MEC.

Thus, the striosome–dendron bouquets likely represent specialized integrative units within the dopamine-containing nigral system. Given evidence that striosomes receive input from cortical regions related to mood and motivation and that they link functionally to reinforcement and decision-making, the striosome–dendron bouquets could be critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease.

People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that conversations with faster response times were perceived as more connected than the same conversations with slower response times. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

This reduction in Fe levels was associated with reduced levels of bisretinoid lipofuscin and reduced cell death in the retina. These findings indicate that intracellular Fe promotes bisretinoid oxidation and degradation. This interpretation was supported by experiments showing that Fe chelation decreased the oxidative/degradation of the bisretinoid A2E in the presence of light and reduced cell death in cell-based experiments. Moreover, light-independent oxidation and degradation of A2E by Fenton chemistry products were evidenced by the consumption of A2E, release of dicarbonyls, and generation of oxidized A2E species in cell-free assays.

This study contributes to understanding the evolution of predatory specialization, and its consequences for the functioning of food webs."

The fossil record for the evolution of the hand is particularly poor between 800,000 and 1.8 My old, a time interval well documented for the emergence and subsequent proliferation of Acheulian technology. We report the discovery of a hominin hand fossil from East Africa that provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key derived feature of the modern human hand, the third metacarpal styloid process. This fossil suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato. This finding is important for understanding the evolution of the human hand and the origins of modern human hand morphology. It also has implications for the evolution of the human hand in the context of the evolution of modern humans and Neandertals."

One such metabolic adaptation is the ability to use serine as a one-carbon donor, which is essential for the synthesis of purine nucleotides. This study identifies a small-molecule inhibitor of serine metabolism that blocks tumor growth in a mouse model. The inhibitor is effective in a number of cancer cell lines, but paradoxically increases cytotoxicity in a subset of cancer cell lines that are deficient in glycine import. This study identifies a metabolic vulnerability of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which is a particularly aggressive form of cancer, and suggests a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of this disease. This study also provides a proof-of-concept for the use of small-molecule inhibitors of serine metabolism in the treatment of cancer. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

This study shows that deforestation can reduce people’s consumption of fruits and vegetables and thus their vitamin A adequacy. Conversely, forest fragmentation can increase people’s consumption of fruits and vegetables and thus their vitamin A adequacy. These findings have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. This study also highlights the importance of using a causal modeling approach to understand the effects of environmental change on people’s diets. This approach can be used to test causal hypotheses and to make causal inferences in the presence of confounding and endogeneity. This study also highlights the importance of using multiple sources of data to test causal hypotheses. This study combines two-way fixed-effects regression analysis with covariate balancing generalized propensity score (CBGPS) weighting, which allowed for causal inferences to be made. This approach can be used to test causal hypotheses and to make causal inferences in the presence of confounding and endogeneity.</em>"

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants."
