The approach is purely categorical and does not presuppose any analytical structure. The axioms are designed to be as simple as possible and to capture the essence of quantum theory. The axioms are shown to be sufficient to characterize the category of operators on Hilbert spaces. The axioms are then shown to be necessary by showing that they imply the standard axioms of quantum theory. The approach is illustrated by showing that the category of continuous linear operators between Hilbert spaces is equivalent to the category of operators on Hilbert spaces.

Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Show more)"

The disease is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is able to evade the antiviral action of interferon (IFN) by blocking nuclear import of signaling proteins. Here we show that the accessory protein Orf6 of SARS-CoV-2 is able to block nuclear import of STAT1 and STAT2. We found that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and interacts with Nup98-Rae1. We show that this interaction is required for the anti-IFN activity of Orf6. Our results unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of the proton channel. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on the proton channel: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits the proton channel will further our understanding of the proton channel and might provide valuable information for future drug development for the proton channel"

We quantify the impact of global warming on maize production and yield variability in the major maize-producing and -exporting countries. We find that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields will increase almost everywhere to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields. For the top four maize-exporting countries, which account for 87% of global maize exports, the probability that they have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. They also underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance. (Show more)"

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is largely unknown because of the difficulty of species-level identification of plant remains in traditional studies. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammals in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results highlight the importance of diet composition in understanding the mechanisms of coexistence in large mammal communities. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

However, the global load of plastic debris on the open ocean surface is still unknown. We show that the global load of plastic debris on the open ocean surface is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This is due to size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

We present a continuous, first-of-its-kind 1.3-My record of the hydroclimate of Lake Malawi, East Africa. Our results show that the evolution of the lake was driven by large-scale changes in the effective moisture of the climate. We observe a dramatic shift in the hydroclimate at the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, consistent with far-field climate forcing, which separates vastly different hydroclimate regimes before and after 800,000 years ago. The lake level variations exerted a profound influence on the evolution of the endemic cichlid fish species flock. The rapid diversification of the species flock was enabled by the reconfiguration of the lake habitat, which allowed for the formation of new ecological niches. The hydroclimate variability of the lake was a key driver of this rapid speciation.

These social-learning conditions were compared with an asocial individual-learning condition in which individual participants made repeated attempts at constructing a paper plane, without having access to any planes produced by other participants.

We also show that APOE4 increases the rate of C1q accumulation in the brain, which may be due to the increased rate of synapse pruning. These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes. They also suggest the hypothesis that APOE4 may be associated with AD risk in part due to defective phagocytic capacity of astrocytes, which accelerates the rate of accumulation of senescent synapses, enhancing synaptic vulnerability to classical-complement-cascade mediated neurodegeneration.

This enzyme recognizes capped RNAs by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5′ termini, resulting in a one-nucleotide shift in substrate specificity. The unconventional manner in which RppH recognizes capped 5′ ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress.

The temperature of the surface is in turn controlled by the intensity of solar radiation. The intensity of solar radiation, in turn, is controlled by the distance of the Earth from the Sun. Thus, the temperature of the surface is a function of the distance of the Earth from the Sun, which in turn is a function of time. This relationship between the distance of the Earth from the Sun and the temperature of the surface has been used to infer the temperature of the surface of the Earth over geological time. We show that this relationship can be used to infer the temperature of the surface of the Earth over geological time. This finding is consistent with previous interpretations based on isotopic evidence. These findings are important for understanding the coevolution of life and environment over Earth history.

We found that low humidity impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

The auditory organs of these animals are extremely diverse in anatomy after hundreds of millions of years of evolution, yet they are all made up of cellular tissue and are morphologically part of the body. Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. We find that the web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to capture the sound-induced air particle movements that approach the maximum physical efficiency better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By sensing the motion of web threads, the spider remotely detects and localizes the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave. The spider enables the flexibility to functionally adjust and regularly regenerate its external ""eardrum"" according to its needs. The outsourcing and supersizing of auditory function in spiders provide unique features for studying extended and regenerative sensing and designing novel acoustic flow detectors for precise fluid dynamic measurement and manipulation.

The stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. In this study, we developed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. We found that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the unique properties of pol δ and may have implications for the design of new DNA polymerases for therapeutic applications.

The source of the parchment, often called “uterine vellum,” has been a long-standing controversy in codicology. The Latin term abortivum in many sources has led some scholars to suggest that fetal calves or sheep skins were used. Others have argued that it would not be possible to sustain herds if so many pocket Bibles were made from fetal skins, arguing instead for unexpected alternatives, such as rabbit. Here, we report a simple and objective method to identify the animal origin of parchment. The noninvasive method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals.

Onset of a major reorganization of the carbon cycle immediately precedes the initiation of extinction and is punctuated by a sharp (3‰), short-lived negative spike in the isotopic composition of carbonate carbon. Carbon cycle volatility persists for ∼500 ka before a return to near preextinction values. Decamillenial to millennial level resolution of the mass extinction and its aftermath will permit a refined evaluation of the relative roles of rate-dependent processes contributing to the extinction, allowing insight into postextinction ecosystem expansion.

Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs.

We show that the climate conditions in Asia and Europe were favorable for the introduction of plague into European harbors, and that the bacterium was reintroduced into Europe at regular intervals of 15 ± 1 y. Our results suggest that the rodent reservoir of the plague was not in Europe, but in Asia. This finding has important implications for the search for the plague reservoir.

The identification of candidate leukemic stem cells is a major challenge in the treatment of AML. We show here that monoclonal antibodies targeting the IL1RAP (IL1R3) receptor on candidate AML stem cells have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. We further show that an antibody targeting IL1RAP can be used to target IL-1 signaling and to treat primary human AML cells. These results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. The results also provide a proof of principle for the use of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of other diseases. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

We used a grid-based approach to sample at high resolution the genomic diversity (including maternal lineages, paternal lineages, and genome-wide data) across 257 villages and 2,704 Malagasy individuals. We find a common Bantu and Austronesian descent for all Malagasy individuals with a limited paternal contribution from Europe and the Middle East. Admixture and demographic growth happened recently, suggesting a rapid settlement of Madagascar during the last millennium. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, there are geographic influences on the present genomic diversity, independent of the admixture, showing that a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. Our results provide insights into the human history of Madagascar and the settlement of the island. They also provide a reference for the study of human diversity and the settlement of other islands.

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The RNA encodes a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC) that interacts with glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and increases dehydrogenase activity. We found that overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

We use a high-resolution large ensemble to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the probability of occurrence of multiyear rainfall deficits in southwestern South Africa. We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% by the year 2100 under an intermediate-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5) and to 80% under a high-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5-8.5). These results highlight the strong sensitivity of the drought risk in SSA to future anthropogenic emissions. This work is a first step toward quantifying the risk of anthropogenic climate change to water security in SSA. Future work should focus on the economic impact of such droughts. (Show more)

The formation of the fifth ring of the chlorophyll molecule is a key step in the biosynthesis of the chlorophyll pigments. This reaction is catalyzed by two unrelated enzymes. The majority of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria use a [4Fe-4S] cluster protein, whereas plants, cyanobacteria, and some phototrophic bacteria possess a diiron protein. This work shows that the diiron protein is the cyclase in oxygenic phototrophs, and that different classes of the enzyme exist based on their requirement for an additional subunit.

Therefore, it is difficult to identify the causal genes. We used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. Our results suggest that behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting is a core mechanism of autism.

Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions in the brain and spinal cord of patients with ALS are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. Rather, the proteins that form inclusions are supersaturated even more than the native interaction partners. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in ALS. They also suggest that the presence of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons may be a general feature of neurodegenerative diseases. (Read more)"

The device configuration also enables application of optical tweezers for controlled placement of atoms. Devices can be fabricated reliably from a 200-nm silicon nitride device layer using a lithography-based process, producing predicted optical properties in transmission and reflection measurements. These 2D photonic crystal devices can be readily deployed to experiments for many-body physics with neutral atoms and engineering of exotic quantum matter. The device is scalable to large arrays of atoms and can be deployed in a wide range of applications.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas the more rigid uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into"

However, the economic and ecological costs of wildfire have risen substantially in recent decades. Climate change has likely contributed to the increase in wildfire activity, but the direct role of people in increasing wildfire activity has been largely overlooked. We show that humans have vastly expanded the geographic and seasonal extent of wildfire in the United States, accounting for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. Human-caused wildfires disproportionally occurred where fuel moisture was higher than lightning-caused fires, thereby helping expand the geographic and seasonal niche of wildfire. Actions to raise awareness and increase management in regions prone to human-started wildfires should be a focus of United States policy to reduce fire risk and associated hazards."

We demonstrate that the catabolism of amino acids during heat stress leads to an increase in the release of ammonium, which in turn promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host.

FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

This study demonstrates that FTs can function as an important interplant flowering signal in host–parasite interactions. The unique means of flowering regulation of dodder illustrates how regressive evolution, commonly found in parasites, may facilitate the physiological synchronization of parasite and host, here allowing the C. australis parasite to time reproduction exactly with that of their hosts, likely optimizing parasite fitness.

The SAN is composed of specialized cardiomyocytes, which are responsible for heart rate regulation. The SAN is a highly coordinated system that integrates multiple signals from the heart surface and internal stores of intracellular Ca2+ to regulate heart rate. Here, we report that stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is a key regulator of Ca2+ signaling in the SAN. Cardiac-specific deletion of STIM1 in mice resulted in depletion of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ stores of SAN cells and led to SAN dysfunction, as was evident by a reduction in heart rate, sinus arrest, and an exaggerated autonomic response to cholinergic signaling. These studies reveal that STIM1 is a multifunctional regulator of Ca2+ dynamics in SAN cells that links SR Ca2+ store content with electrical events occurring in the plasma membrane, thereby contributing to automaticity of the SAN. This study provides insights into the mechanisms of SAN function and may lead to the development of new therapies for heart failure. (Show more)"

However, its function in plant defense against insect herbivores has not been well characterized. Here, we show that Si pretreatment of rice plants enhanced resistance against the rice leaffolder, a key insect pest, in wild-type plants but not in RNAi lines that were silenced for the jasmonate (JA) biosynthesis enzyme allene oxide synthase (OsAOS) and the JA perception enzyme CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (OsCOI1). This interaction between Si and JA was associated with reduced Si cell expansion and reduced accumulation of Si in the leaves of OsAOS and OsCOI1 RNAi plants after insect attack. These results suggest that Si priming of JA-mediated defense responses and promotion of Si accumulation by JA may be a key mechanism for Si-enhanced resistance against insect herbivores. This study provides insights into the mechanism of Si-enhanced resistance against insect herbivores. (Show more)"

Here we propose a mechanism for memory in the brain that is based on changes in the excitability of single neurons. We show that changes in the strength of synaptic connections can support memory, but that changes in the intrinsic excitability of neurons are necessary for memory on timescales ranging from milliseconds to seconds. This mechanism is sensitive to context and serial order, and it is suitable for the binding of linguistic features over time.

We show that the 6 largest tributaries of Lake Michigan accounted for ∼70% of the daily nitrogen and phosphorus delivered to the lake. However, small tributaries exhibited nutrient loads that were high for their size and biased toward dissolved inorganic forms. Higher bioavailability of nutrients from small watersheds suggests greater potential to fuel algal blooms in coastal areas. Our findings reveal an underappreciated role that small streams may play in driving coastal eutrophication in large water bodies. Although they represent only a modest proportion of lake-wide loads, expanding nutrient management efforts to address smaller watersheds could reduce the ecological impacts of nutrient loading on valuable nearshore ecosystems."

We use a mouse model of NMDAR-Ab encephalitis to show that the same changes in synaptic parameters that are tolerated in the in silico model of the control condition can lead to paroxysms when the same parameter fluctuations are allowed in the model of the disease condition. This suggests that the same circuit mechanisms are at play in both the control and disease conditions. These findings offer mechanistic insights into circuit-level dysfunction induced by NMDAR-Ab. They also suggest that the same treatment that is effective in the mouse model may be effective in patients. This may be a promising avenue for future research.

Our results suggest that shifts between prey types are linked to shifts in the morphology, mode of evolution, and evolutionary correlations of tentilla and their nematocysts. These findings contribute to understanding how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs.
