The guest molecule is usually a small molecule, such as CO2, CH4, or H2O. The hydrate structure has been widely studied in the past decades. However, the structure of hydrate formed by a large guest molecule, such as neon, has not been reported. In this work, we report the structure of neon hydrate. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The resolved structure where Ne dissolved in ice II is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. The density distributions indicate that the vibration of Ne atoms is mainly in planes perpendicular to D2O channels, whereas their distributions along the channels are further constrained by interactions between adjacent Ne atoms. Our work provides a new route to study the structure of hydrate. It also provides a new phase for studying the dynamics of guest molecules. The structure of neon hydrate may be of interest to the community of geophysics. The structure of neon hydrate may be of interest to the community of geophysics"

The evolutionary origin of this group has been enigmatic, and a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we present the first comparative genomic analysis of two distantly related myxozoan species, which show that the myxozoan body plan is reduced to the essential elements required for parasitism. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study may help to understand the origin of the Myxozoa and the evolution of parasitism in general. (Show more)"

The disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus has a complex life cycle that involves multiple stages of infection. One of the most important stages is the infection of host cells. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to block nuclear import of STAT1 and STAT2, which are key components of the IFN-mediated antiviral signaling pathway. We found that the viral accessory protein Orf6 is responsible for this activity. We also show that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1, which is a key component of the NPC. Our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

However, the extent to which LMH partition food resources is largely unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level differences in diet. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant LMH species (six wild, one domestic) in semiarid African savanna. We found that LMH consumed a wide range of plant species, and that species were dissimilar in their diets. Nonetheless, species were not completely dissimilar, and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results also highlight the need for more comprehensive species-level diet data in future studies of LMH ecology and conservation. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

This indicates that the grains condensed in outflows of asymptotic giant branch stars &lt;4.9 Ga ago that possibly formed during an episode of enhanced star formation ∼7 Ga ago.

The disease is characterized by the accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregates in affected oligodendrocytes. We show here that the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 is able to limit the accumulation of α-syn in a mouse model of MSA. This effect was associated with a reduction of truncated α-syn and with neuroprotection. These results suggest that VX-765 could be a promising candidate to slow down the progression of MSA. This would be of great importance as there is no treatment available to slow down the aggressive neurodegenerative process. Our results also suggest that caspase-1 could be a promising therapeutic target in synucleinopathies.

Here we show that anxiety, a personality trait, directly influences social dominance in male outbred rats and identify an important mediating role for mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens. High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low-anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as decreased ATP and increased ROS production in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious individuals. We conclude that mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens is crucial for social hierarchy establishment and is critically involved in the low social competitiveness associated with high anxiety.

Furthermore, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a transcriptional target of SREBP1, mediates the ferroptosis-suppressing activity of SREBP1 by producing monounsaturated fatty acids.

We show that the NWFP halted the decline of early-seral–associated bird populations, but the decline of older-forest–associated species accelerated. This is partly because of the loss of older forests due to fire on federal land and continued clearcutting elsewhere. The NWFP is a unique opportunity to evaluate the influence of policy. Our findings highlight the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure.

We used a comprehensive dataset of 89 genes to estimate the timing and rates of beetle diversification, and a dataset of 154 genomes or transcriptomes to trace the evolution of genes enabling symbiont-independent digestion of lignocellulose. Phylogenomic analyses of these uniquely comprehensive datasets resolved previously controversial beetle relationships, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, corresponding (Jurassic) diversification rate increases suggest that these novel genes triggered adaptive radiations that resulted in nearly half of all living beetle species. We propose that these novel genes enabled efficient digestion of plant tissues, including lignocellulose in cell walls, facilitating the evolution of uniquely specialized plant-feeding habits, such as leaf mining and stem and wood boring. Beetle diversity thus appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding PCWDEs.

We also found that APOE4 increases the rate of C1q accumulation in hippocampus, which may represent the accumulation of senescent synapses with enhanced vulnerability to complement-mediated degeneration. These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes. They also suggest the hypothesis that APOE4 may be associated with AD risk in part because of defective astrocytic phagocytic capacity, which accelerates the rate of accumulation of C1q-coated senescent synapses, enhancing synaptic vulnerability to classical-complement-cascade mediated neurodegeneration. These studies provide a mechanistic explanation for the association of APOE4 with AD risk and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for AD."

The second step is the nucleation of the hcp phase, which is the stable phase at the outer core temperature. This mechanism reduces the required undercooling of iron nucleation, which provides a key factor in solving the inner core nucleation paradox.

Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346–1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats. This study has implications for our understanding of the history of plague and the evolution of vector control. It also has implications for the spread of other diseases by human ectoparasites."

However, this approach is biased because brain size is not the only factor that determines the computational capacity of the brain. We use the largest dataset of its kind to reconstruct the evolution of brain size in amniotes. We show that reptiles have not only small brains relative to body size but also low neuronal densities, resulting in average neuron numbers over 20 times lower than those in birds and mammals of similar body size. Amniote brain evolution is characterized by the following four major shifts in neuron–brain scaling. The most dramatic increases in brain neurons occurred independently with the appearance of birds and mammals, resulting in convergent neuron scaling in the two endotherm lineages. The other two major increases happened in core land birds and anthropoid primates, which are two groups known for their cognitive prowess."

TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 may act as a tumor suppressor in some settings."

Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to study the action of ADF/cofilin in different mechanical situations. We find that ADF/cofilin binds to actin filaments and severes them in a mechanical-torque-dependent manner. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. Our findings provide insights into the mechanism of ADF/cofilin action and may help us understand its role in cell motility and cancer metastasis.

We test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed of Facebook users. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks.

We show that the presence of one of the most common modifications present in mRNA coding regions, pseudouridine (Ψ), impedes amino acid addition and EF-Tu GTPase activation. We also find that the presence of Ψ can promote the low-level synthesis of multiple peptide products from a single mRNA sequence in the bacterial translation system.

The existence of this body size attractor and the relatively rapid selection toward, and limited deviation from, this attractor rule out most hypothesized drivers of size increase. These results are consistent with control by differences in the scaling of energetic intake and cost functions with body size between the terrestrial and aquatic realms.

This work illustrates the structural basis for antifungal activity of a unique NCR peptide and paves the way for future development of this class of peptides as a spray-on fungistat/fungicide.

In the case of internally fertilizing species, such as insects, the male’s contribution to the female’s offspring is likely to be limited to the sperm. However, the extent of such contributions is largely unknown. Here, we show that the proteome of Drosophila sperm undergoes substantial changes after being transferred to the female reproductive tract. We also show that the female reproductive tract contributes to the sperm proteome, and that these contributions support sperm viability during the prolonged period between copulation and fertilization. Our research provides a comprehensive characterization of the posttesticular life history of the sperm proteome and expands our understanding of the critical process of sperm–FRT interactions. This work will be of interest to the broader proteomics community and will be useful for understanding the molecular basis of sperm–FRT interactions in other species. (Show more)"

The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic activation gate and normally shows no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. Our findings may help us understand the BK channel’s unique properties and may provide a new approach for drug development. This study also provides a new paradigm for the regulation of ion channels."

In the temperate regions, seasonal outbreaks of influenza virus correlate with decreases in humidity. While low ambient humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

The auditory organs of animals are diverse in anatomy after hundreds of millions of years of evolution, yet all are made up of cellular tissue and are morphologically part of the body of the animal. Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. We find that the spider’s web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to sense the motion of web threads, which allows the spider to remotely detect and localize the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself. The outsourcing and supersizing of auditory function in spiders provide unique features for studying extended and regenerative sensing and designing novel acoustic flow detectors for precise fluid dynamic measurement and manipulation.

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, in the days (Studies 1 and 2) and months (Studies 3 through 6) following the 2016 American presidential election, women’s and men’s endorsement of hegemonic masculinity predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education.

The color of nectar is often used as an indicator of the reward’s nutritional value. Here, we show that the color of the red nectar of Nesocodon mauritianus is derived from a previously undescribed alkaloid. We identify the three enzymatic activities that are necessary for the production of this pigment. We also identify the alkaloid in the red nectar of two distantly related species, which have evolved this trait convergently. This work suggests that the red nectar of Nesocodon and Jaltomata is selectively favored and that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation. This work provides insight into the evolution of a unique floral trait."

This heterogeneity includes signals of genetic ancestry ranging from western Europe to East Asia. In addition, we show that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how HKU4 and HKU5 transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4.

We found that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion.

Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

This may facilitate binding to the receptor and the subsequent structural rearrangements required for viral membrane fusion. This may explain the increased infectivity of the mutant virus.

This glycan is catabolized by the symbiont, which is thus able to maintain a healthy population level only after the organ has matured. This glycan is also required for the acidification of the crypts, which enhances the luminescence of the symbiont.

Despite advances in therapy, the prognosis of AML remains poor, and there is an urgent need for novel and more efficient therapies. We show here that monoclonal antibodies targeting the IL1RAP (IL1R3) receptor can efficiently target AML stem cells in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This study provides a proof-of-concept for the use of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This approach may be applicable"

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

We use a high-resolution climate model to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the probability of occurrence of multiyear rainfall deficits in southwestern South Africa. We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% by the year 2100 under an intermediate-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5) and to 80% under a high-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5-8.5).

Neuroinflammation is a complex process that involves multiple cell types, including microglia, astrocytes, and neurons. Neuroinflammation is associated with the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) ASK1. In this study, we found that ASK1 in microglia plays a major role in generating and maintaining disease. ASK1-deficient microglia exhibited reduced activation and reduced production of proinflammatory mediators, including CCL2, which further activated and recruited astrocytes. Astrocyte-specific ASK1 deletion was achieved using a CX3CR1CreER system, and we found that ASK1 signaling in microglia played a major role in generating and maintaining disease. Our findings suggest that ASK1 in microglia is a promising therapeutic target for reducing neuroinflammation.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. Our study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility in autism and suggests a potential therapeutic target. Our findings may also provide insights into the mechanisms of other complex disorders with behavioral inflexibility as a core feature. This study may also help to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms."

Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions in the brain and spinal cord are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. To explain the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in ALS, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

Virions must first be cleaved sequentially by cell-surface proteases, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. We found that the first cleavages are significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence. Without the first cleavages, MERS viruses resisted receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. These findings suggest that the first cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence.

All three conclusions support the conventional wisdom of election administration experts and contradict many popular claims in the media. Our findings suggest that vote-by-mail is a safe and effective way to conduct elections during the COVID-19 pandemic."

This dimerization interface is unique to SARS-CoV-2, and we hypothesize that it may be involved in immune evasion and/or spread. This structure provides a foundation for future studies of the role of ORF8 in the pandemic."

Indeed, STING deficiency decreased expression of β-cell function–related genes, contributing to impaired GSIS. Mechanistically, the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) and cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&amp;Tag) analyses suggested that Pax6 was the transcription factor that might be associated with defective GSIS in STING-βKO mice.

The genome of influenza A viruses is segmented into eight fragments, which offers evolutionary advantages but complicates genomic packaging. The existence of a selective packaging mechanism, in which one copy of each viral RNA is specifically packaged into each virion, is suspected, but its molecular details remain unknown. Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus. This interaction takes place in infected cells and is required for optimal viral replication. Disruption of this interaction decreased the amount of viral RNA in the viral particles, resulting in an eightfold increase in empty viral particles. This interaction is not widely conserved among influenza A viruses. The lack of conservation might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses. Our results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of viral genome packaging. They also have implications for the development of influenza vaccines and antiviral drugs. (Show more)"

We demonstrate that the catabolism of amino acids during heat stress promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates, thereby contributing to the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis.

Here, we used a different approach, which measures the total activity of the brain, to identify and validate reproducible resting state networks in healthy and disease populations. We found that the dominant resting state network in healthy subjects was topographically similar to the default mode network.

Network functionality was assessed by quantifying the expression of the resting state networks in rest and during task performance. We found that the dominant resting state network was deactivated during task performance, and that this abnormality was partially corrected by dopaminergic therapy. This study provides a new approach to the study of the resting brain."

However, the role of FSIP1 in the progression and drug sensitivity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. This article is protected by copyright.

Moreover, subjects with increased gut permeability also had altered composition and activity of the gut microbiota. These results suggest the existence of a gut–brain axis in alcohol dependence, which implicates the gut microbiota as an actor in the gut barrier and in behavioral disorders. Thus, the gut microbiota seems to be a previously unidentified target in the management of alcohol dependence.

This gene encodes a flavin-dependent monooxygenase that catalyzes the formation of the nitrogenous moiety in these compounds. This work provides a major step forward in understanding the biosynthesis of tomato fruit flavor. It also opens the door to the development of new strategies for the production of other nitrogenous flavor compounds. (Show more)"

However, these factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we use high-throughput experiments to investigate how changes in temperature affect the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We found that changes in temperature systematically altered the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures departed from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increased, meaning that more species were required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. Our findings have important implications for the design of biodiversity conservation strategies and the management of ecosystems under climate change. This article is protected by copyright.

The unique means of flowering regulation of dodder illustrates how regressive evolution, commonly found in parasites, may facilitate the physiological synchronization of parasite and host, here allowing the C. australis parasite to time reproduction exactly with that of their hosts, likely optimizing parasite fitness.

We show that striatonigral fibers originating in striosomes form highly unusual bouquet-like arborizations that target bundles of ventrally extending dopamine-containing dendrites and clusters of their parent nigral cell bodies. These clustered cell bodies in turn project to the striatum as part of the classic nigrostriatal pathway. Thus, these striosome–dendron bouquets likely represent subsystems with the nigro–striato–nigral loop that are affected in human disorders including Parkinson’s disease. Given evidence that striosomes receive input from cortical regions related to the control of mood and motivation and that they link functionally to reinforcement and decision-making, the striosome–dendron bouquets could be critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease. This study provides a unique view of the organization of the dopamine-containing nigral system. It also suggests that the bouquet–dendron formation is a general feature of the striatonigral system.

We show that STIM1 is selectively expressed in the specialized cardiomyocytes of the SAN, and that its deletion in mice leads to a reduction in the number of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores in these cells. This leads to a reduction in the heart rate and to an exaggerated autonomic response. These results reveal a previously unknown role for STIM1 in Ca2+ dynamics in the SAN.

The oxidation of A2E is catalyzed by light and reactive oxygen species. We show that the accumulation of bisretinoids is reduced in mice with reduced levels of intracellular iron. This reduction is mediated by the chelator deferiprone, which increases intracellular iron levels. These findings have implications for the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in the elderly. They also suggest that the oxidation of A2E may be a target for the treatment of this disease. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the role of iron in the formation of the damaging species that contribute to the loss of photoreceptor cells in age-related macular degeneration. It also provides a rationale for the use of deferiprone in the treatment of this disease. (Read more)"

However, in some predators, prey capture is localized in separate structures. One of the most extreme cases of this modularity can be observed in the pelagic siphonophores, a group of cnidarians that use tentilla (tentacle side branches armed with nematocysts) exclusively for prey capture. We show that siphonophore specialists can evolve into generalists, and that specialists on one prey type have directly evolved into specialists on other prey types. Our findings help build a broader perspective on predatory niche diversification via morphological innovation and evolution. These findings contribute to understanding how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs."

The earliest hominin fossils are incomplete, and the time interval between the appearance of the first hominids and the emergence of the distinctive derived features of the modern human hand is poorly documented. We report the discovery of a hominin hand fossil from East Africa that preserves the third metacarpal styloid process, a key derived feature of the modern human hand. This fossil provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of this key derived feature of the human hand. The timing of the evolution of this feature suggests that it arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo. This finding has implications for our understanding of the evolution of the human hand and its relationship to the Neandertal hand. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

One-carbon units are required for cell growth, and are provided by the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). Here we show that dual knockout of SHMT1 and SHMT2 in cancer cells blocks tumor growth. We also identify a small-molecule inhibitor of SHMT1/2, which is effective in cancer cells and in cancer cell-line screens. Finally, we show that one-carbon donor formate is a potent rescue of SHMT inhibition in cancer cells, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in a cancer cell line that is uniquely dependent upon SHMT enzymatic activity for glycine import. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of cancer cells. This work provides a rationale for targeting SHMT in cancer. It also provides a platform for the development of a small-molecule cancer drug that is effective in a broad range of cancer cell types. This is a significant advance in the development of cancer therapeutics."

In low- and middle-income countries, forests are often overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, despite the fact that forests can provide people with access to a variety of foods that are rich in micronutrients. This study shows that deforestation can have negative impacts on people’s diets and micronutrient adequacy, and that this is likely to be the case in many other settings. This study has important implications for policy makers, who should consider the role of forests in improving people’s diets and nutrition."

We show that the increase in mechanization has led to the propagation of subsoil compaction into deeper soil layers. This has the potential to reduce soil productivity and has been exacerbated by the increase in vehicle weight. We propose that the design of farm machinery should consider intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. This may help to reduce subsoil compaction and improve soil productivity."
