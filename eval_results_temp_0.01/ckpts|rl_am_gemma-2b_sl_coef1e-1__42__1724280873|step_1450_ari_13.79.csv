In this work, we report the synthesis and structure of neon hydrate, which is the first example of a hydrate with ice II structure. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The resolved structure where Ne dissolved in ice II is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. The density distributions indicate that the vibration of Ne atoms is mainly in planes perpendicular to D2O channels, whereas their distributions along the channels are further constrained by interactions between adjacent Ne atoms. This work provides a new route to study the structure of ice II, which is the most stable phase of water at high pressure and low temperature. It also provides a new route to study the structure of ice II-structured hydrates. The latter is of great importance to the study of the structure of ice Ih, which is the most stable phase of water at ambient conditions."

Here, we report the genomes of two myxozoans, Kudoa iwatai and Myxobolus cerebralis, and compare them to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results show that the myxozoan body plan is reduced to the essential elements required for parasitism, and that the genome is reduced in size and gene content. These results suggest that the transition from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic myxozoan was accompanied by a dramatic reduction in genome size and gene content. This is the first report of a genome from a parasitic myxozoan, and the results provide a unique resource for understanding the evolution of the Myxozoa and the transition from a free-living to parasitic lifestyle.

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2 in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes. We found that SARS-CoV-2 Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 is able to evade the host immune response and may provide a target for the development of new antiviral strategies.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species of African LMH. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers. Grass consumption inferred from DNA sequence relative read abundance ranged from &gt;99% (plains zebra) to &lt;1% (dik-dik). Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.

However, the global load of plastic debris on the open ocean surface is still unknown. We show that the global load of plastic debris on the open ocean surface is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This discrepancy is explained by the selective removal of plastic debris on the open ocean surface by nano-fragmentation and transference to the ocean interior. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered.

This resistance is mediated by the induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism.

The treatment of hypertension is the cornerstone of the treatment of heart failure. The most common drugs for treating hypertension are the L-type Ca2+ channel blockers. These drugs are used in the majority of patients with hypertension. However, the use of these drugs is associated with the development of heart failure. Here, we show that these drugs activate the Ca2+ signaling machinery in vascular smooth muscle cells, which promotes vascular remodeling.

Our results show that the NWFP halted declines of early-seral birds, but failed to reverse declines of older-forest–associated birds. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure. The NWFP is a model for how science can inform policy and adaptive management. We hope that this study will inspire other conservation efforts to use science to inform policy.

The development of new antibiotics is a major challenge, and computational approaches are essential tools to this end. We present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

We used a comprehensive dataset of 154 beetle genomes and transcriptomes to trace the evolution of beetle genes enabling symbiont-independent digestion of lignocellulose, and to trace the evolution of beetle species and lineages over time. We found that plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, these novel genes triggered adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding PCWDEs. We propose that PCWDEs enabled efficient digestion of plant tissues, including lignocellulose in cell walls, facilitating the evolution of uniquely specialized plant-feeding habits, such as leaf mining and stem and wood boring. Beetle diversity thus appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding PC"

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal cells is not well understood. We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor.

We find that ADF binds to filaments in a mechanical-dependent manner, and that this binding enhances severing. We propose that this mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. Our findings have implications for understanding severing in cells and for developing new strategies to treat diseases caused by actin filament networks.

Here, we use a combination of comparative phylogenetic analysis and examination of the fossil record to show that the evolution of an aquatic lifestyle is driving three of the four extant aquatic mammal clades toward a size attractor at ∼500 kg. The existence of this body size attractor and the relatively rapid selection toward, and limited deviation from, this attractor rule out most hypothesized drivers of size increase. These three independent body size increases and a shared aquatic optimum size are consistent with control by differences in the scaling of energetic intake and cost functions with body size between the terrestrial and aquatic realms. Water-dwelling mammals are driven and confined to larger body sizes by the strict energetic demands of the aquatic medium.

This work describes the antifungal activity of a unique, highly dynamic, and structurally defined NCR peptide, which is a member of a large family of nodule-specific peptides in the model legume Medicago truncatula. The antifungal activity of the peptide is attributed to its ability to bind to and disrupt the cell wall of the fungal pathogen.

Here, we introduce a new instrument, the dual-field-of-view high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL), to overcome this conundrum. The HSRL can simultaneously profile aerosol and cloud properties, especially cloud microphysical properties. We demonstrate the scientific potential of this instrument by conducting a case study over Beijing. The observations show that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI process. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI.

The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We induced C-type inactivation in BK channels and studied the relationship between activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery. We observed prominent slow C-type inactivation/recovery in BK channels by an extreme low concentration of extracellular K+ together with a Y294E/K/Q/S or Y279F mutation whose equivalent in Shaker channels (T449E/K/D/Q/S or W434F) caused a greatly accelerated rate of C-type inactivation or constitutive C-inactivation.

In the temperate regions, seasonal influenza virus outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in ambient humidity. While low ambient humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the impact of low ambient humidity on influenza virus infection and disease outcome.

We show that soil health management practices can mitigate this trend and that the use of diverse, rotationally grazed pastures can increase soil C storage on agricultural lands. These results highlight the potential of grasslands to sequester C and provide a pathway for climate-smart agriculture.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions.

The stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. In S. cerevisiae, the extreme stability of the pol δ holoenzyme ensures that every nucleobase within an Okazaki fragment is faithfully duplicated before dissociation. However, the stability of the human pol δ holoenzyme is unknown. We designed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. Surprisingly, the results indicate that human pol δ maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This study provides a unique perspective on the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme and its implications for lagging strand synthesis in humans. It also provides a unique system to study the role of PCNA in the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme.

First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

The age model is consistent with the hypothesis that the extinction was triggered by a combination of volcanism, carbon cycle disruption, and climate change. The carbon cycle response is consistent with the hypothesis that the extinction was followed by a period of ecosystem reorganization. The age model presented here provides a starting point for a more detailed analysis of the extinction and recovery dynamics. (Less)"

Here, we generate intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific RORα-deficient (RORαΔIEC) mice and find that RORα is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis by attenuating nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcriptional activity. RORαΔIEC mice exhibit excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis reveals corecruitment of RORα and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) on NF-κB target promoters and subsequent dismissal of CREB binding protein (CBP) and bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) for transcriptional repression.

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

We use a high-resolution climate model to quantify the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the probability of occurrence of multiyear rainfall deficits in southwestern South Africa. We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% by the year 2100 under an intermediate-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5) and to 80% under a high-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5-8.5).

Neuroinflammation is also known to be associated with the progression of MS. However, the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms of neuroinflammation in EAE remain unknown. In this study, we found that ASK1 is a critical regulator of neuroinflammation in EAE. We also found that ASK1 in microglia/macrophages plays a major role in generating and maintaining disease, whereas ASK1 in astrocytes plays a greater proinflammatory role in the later stage. Our findings suggest that ASK1-mediated glial cell interactions are critical in the progression of EAE. We propose glial ASK1 as a promising therapeutic target for reducing neuroinflammation. This study may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for EAE and other neuroinflammatory diseases. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)."

The drought began in 2012 and now includes the lowest calendar-year and 12-mo precipitation, the highest annual temperature, and the most extreme drought indicators on record. The extremely warm and dry conditions have led to acute water shortages, groundwater overdraft, critically low streamflow, and enhanced wildfire risk. We find that precipitation deficits in California were more than twice as likely to yield drought years if they occurred when conditions were warm. We find that although there has not been a substantial change in the probability of either negative or moderately negative precipitation anomalies in recent decades, the occurrence of drought years has been greater in the past two decades than in the preceding century. In addition, the probability that precipitation deficits co-occur with warm conditions and the probability that precipitation deficits produce drought have both increased. We conclude that anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of co-occurring warm–dry conditions like those that have created the acute human and ecosystem impacts associated with the “exceptional” 2012–2014 drought in California."

In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. Our findings provide a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility in autism and may help to identify potential therapeutic targets.

However, the factors that contribute to virus spillover from bats are not well understood. Here, we identified and characterized a protein that is highly concentrated in the submandibular salivary gland of bats, which is a site for microbial community residence. This protein, named MTX, selectively inhibits the epoxide hydrolase function of leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) to inhibit LTA4 hydrolysis and the generation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a potent lipid chemoattractant for host defense against infection. MTX potently inhibited proinflammatory proteases to induce immune tolerance and maintain high stability. In mouse models, influenza A virus (IAV) infection and pathogenicity were exacerbated by MTX, but were reversed by interfering with the effects of MTX on LTA4H or exogenous LTB4 administration. This study provides deeper insight into immunologically privileged sites for microbial community residence in bats and supports the therapeutic potential of targeting MTX-LTA4H.

Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of DLBCL. This work provides a foundation for the development of SHMT inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy for cancer.

This paper provides a comprehensive design-based analysis of the effect of vote-by-mail on electoral outcomes. We find that vote-by-mail does not appear to affect either party’s share of turnout, does not appear to increase either party’s vote share, and modestly increases overall average turnout rates. All three conclusions support the conventional wisdom of election administration experts and contradict many popular claims in the media. Our findings suggest that vote-by-mail is a policy that can be implemented with minimal risk to electoral outcomes."

Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology.

Here, we show that the dominant network in healthy subjects is topographically similar to the default mode network, but that this assumption is not valid in Parkinson’s disease. We also show that the dominant network in healthy subjects is associated with reduced metabolic activity, which is reversed by dopaminergic therapy. This work provides a direct test of the validity of the resting state network hypothesis. It also provides a method for assessing the functional significance of the brain, which can be used to monitor the effects of disease and treatment."

We show that FSIP1 deficiency in TNBC cells impairs drug sensitivity and that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, which is a key component of the autophagy machinery. FSIP1 deficiency promotes autophagy, enhances AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreases mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. These findings uncover a role of FSIP1 in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies.

But how do we know when two people are feeling connected? We asked pairs of friends and strangers to talk with each other and rated their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners.

Cardiac-specific deletion of STIM1 in mice resulted in depletion of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ stores of SANCs and led to SAN dysfunction, as was evident by a reduction in heart rate, sinus arrest, and an exaggerated autonomic response to cholinergic signaling. Moreover, STIM1 influenced SAN function by regulating ionic fluxes in SANCs, including activation of a store-operated Ca2+ current, a reduction in L-type Ca2+ current, and enhancing the activities of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger.

In vertebrates, sex is determined by a single locus, which can be male- or female-determining. In some species, multiple alleles at a sex determination locus can produce more than two genotypic sexes, and in others, the sex determination locus can be lost. Here we investigate the effects of multiple alleles at a sex determination locus on the evolution of secondary sexual characteristics. We find that multiple alleles at a sex determination locus can produce modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics, and that the introgression of a new sex determination allele can produce additional axes of variation for secondary sexual characteristics. These results provide context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of multiple alleles at sex determination loci. (Read more)"

We show that the Fe chelator deferiprone decreases the photodegradation of the bisretinoid A2E in the presence of light and reduces the loss of photoreceptor cells in a mouse model of retinal degeneration. These findings suggest that Fe levels in the retina may impact the accumulation of bisretinoids and the loss of photoreceptor cells. This interpretation is supported by the demonstration that the Fe chelator decreases the oxidation of A2E in the presence of Fenton chemistry products. These results provide insight into the role of Fe in the retina and may lead to the development of new therapies for retinal degeneration.

However, the evolution of predator morphology is often constrained by the need to capture a wide range of prey types. In this study, we show that the evolution of predator morphology can be highly flexible, and that predators can evolve to specialize on new prey types. Our findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution of predator morphology, and for the functioning of food webs. They also have implications for our understanding of the evolution of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning."

One-carbon units are critical for cell growth, and SHMT is strongly up-regulated in cancer. Here we show that dual SHMT1/2 knockout blocks HCT-116 colon cancer tumor xenograft formation. We identify small-molecule dual inhibitors of human SHMT1/2, and show that they are effective cellular target engagers. We also show that formate generally rescues cells from SHMT inhibition, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We demonstrate that this effect is rooted in defective glycine uptake in DLBCL cell lines, rendering them uniquely dependent upon SHMT enzymatic activity to meet glycine demand. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of DLBCL. This work provides a foundation for the development of SHMT inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy for cancer. It also provides a rationale for targeting the glycine import pathway in DLBCL. This latter strategy is currently being explored in a clinical trial. This work also provides a foundation for the development of SHMT inhibitors as a therapeutic"

The mechanization of agriculture has increased the capacity of farm machinery, but it has also increased the weight of vehicles, which has led to subsoil compaction. We show that the weight of modern farm machinery has increased subsoil compaction risk to the point that it now affects 20% of arable land. We hypothesize that this trend is a consequence of the increasing size of sauropods, which roamed the Earth before the development of modern agriculture. Our findings suggest that the roaming of these giants may have had a similar effect on land productivity as modern farm vehicles."
