The evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, and a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the genomes of two myxozoans and a cnidarian parasite, and we show that the myxozoan body plan is remarkably reduced in terms of genome size and gene content. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Abridged) more"

In the latter case, the virus has evolved mechanisms to evade the host immune response. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to block the nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are essential for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes. We found that the viral accessory protein Orf6 is responsible for this activity and that it does so by interfering with the nuclear import of these transcription factors. Our findings provide a mechanism of viral antagonism that may be used by SARS-CoV-2 to escape the antiviral response of the host. (Less)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammal assemblages, and that large mammal diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.

The disease is characterized by the presence of α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregates in affected neurons. The inflammatory protease caspase-1 has been implicated in the mechanisms that promote aggregation of α-syn in vitro and in neuronal cell models of α-syn toxicity. We show here that the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 is able to limit the accumulation of α-syn in a mouse model of MSA. This effect is associated with a reduction of truncated α-syn and with neuroprotection. These results suggest that VX-765 is a promising candidate to achieve disease modification in synucleinopathies by limiting α-syn accumulation. This study provides an in vivo proof of concept for the potential of this drug to slow down the progression of MSA. This is the first study to show that the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 is able to limit the accumulation of α-syn in vivo.

Interestingly, all of the mutant channels exhibited lack of C-type inactivation gating and an inversion of their allosteric coupling (i.e., closing of the activation gate collapses the channel’s selectivity filter). A state-dependent crystallographic study of KcsA-T75A proves that, on activation, the selectivity filter transitions from a nonconductive and deep C-type inactivated conformation to a conductive one. Finally, we provide a crystallographic demonstration that closed-state inactivation can be achieved by the structural collapse of the channel’s selectivity filter.

Despite recent advances in cancer treatment, the majority of patients do not respond to therapy. One of the main reasons for this failure is the emergence of drug resistance, which is often mediated by mutations in key signaling pathways. In this study, we show that the activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway confers resistance to ferroptosis, a form of regulated necrosis that is regulated by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. We also show that this resistance is mediated by the activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1/stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1-dependent lipogenesis, which is essential for the survival of cancer cells in the presence of oxidative stress. Finally, we demonstrate that the combination of ferroptosis induction and mTOR inhibition is effective in preclinical models of cancer. These results suggest that ferroptosis may be a promising strategy for cancer therapy. (Less)"

We used a comprehensive dataset of 154 genomes and transcriptomes to trace the evolution of beetle genes enabling symbiont-independent digestion of lignocellulose, the major component of plant cell walls. Our analyses resolved previously controversial beetle relationships and revealed that plant cell wall-degrading enzymes obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, both major independent origins of specialized herbivory coincide with the first appearances of these genes in beetles. We propose that these novel genes enabled efficient digestion of plant tissues, including lignocellulose in cell walls, facilitating the evolution of uniquely specialized plant-feeding habits, such as leaf mining and stem and wood boring. Beetle diversity thus appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding PCWDEs.

Here, we show that the entanglement dynamics in the space–time scaling limit can be understood in terms of quasiparticles, which are the elementary excitations of the system. This allows us to compute the entanglement dynamics in the paradigmatic case of the Heisenberg chain. Our results are exact and valid in the limit of large system size.

The vector of the Black Death, which caused the pandemic, is still debated. We developed a compartmental model for plague transmission by a human ectoparasite vector. Using Bayesian inference, we found that this model fits mortality curves from nine outbreaks in Europe better than models for pneumonic or rodent transmission. Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346–1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats.

We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor.

Severing is a key process in many cellular processes, including cell motility and cytokinesis. However, the mechanism by which ADF severes filaments is not well understood. Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to study the action of ADF in different mechanical situations. We find that ADF-induced curvature favors severing, while tension has no effect on ADF binding and weakly enhances severing. Surprisingly, we also find that ADF-induced filament torque dramatically enhances severing. A simple model, which faithfully reproduces our experimental observations, suggests that the ADF-induced filament torque increases the severing rate constant by 100-fold. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. We propose that this mechanism is a general principle in severing by ADF and other ADF-like proteins.

We describe how our model is related to pattern formation and proportional growth phenomena and discuss the dichotomy between continuous and discrete models in several contexts. Our aim in this paper is to present an idealized tropical toy model, requiring further investigation."

We show that the sperm proteome undergoes substantial compositional changes after being transferred to the female reproductive tract. Multiple seminal fluid proteins initially associate with sperm, but most become undetectable after sperm are stored. Female-derived proteins also begin to associate with sperm immediately after mating, and they comprise nearly 20% of the postmating sperm proteome following 4 d of storage in the female reproductive tract. Female-derived proteins that associate with sperm are enriched for processes associated with energy metabolism, suggesting that female contributions support sperm viability during the prolonged period between copulation and fertilization. Our research provides a comprehensive characterization of sperm proteome dynamics and expands our understanding of the critical process of sperm–FRT interactions. (Less)"

We have used the thermostability of reconstructed ancestral enzymes to determine the temperature of the surface environment of ancient organisms, and our results are consistent with the surface temperature decreasing over geological time.

Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden.

Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. We find that the spider’s web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to sense the motion of web threads, which is better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself. The outsourcing and supersizing of auditory function in spiders provides unique features for studying extended and regenerative sensing and designing novel acoustic flow detectors for precise fluid dynamic measurement and manipulation.

We show that soil management practices that reduce soil disturbance, diversify crop rotations, and integrate livestock can increase SOC storage and the amount of SOC stored in the mineral soil. These results highlight the potential of well-managed grasslands to sequester carbon and provide a framework for the development of climate-smart agricultural practices.

One of the main rewards plants offer to pollinators is nectar, which is produced by specialized glands in the flower. The color of nectar is often used as an indicator of the quality of the reward. Here, we show that the color of the nectar of the plant Nesocodon mauritianus is derived from a previously undescribed alkaloid. We also show that this alkaloid is attractive to the most likely pollinators of this plant, the gecko lizards. This work demonstrates that the red color of nectar is a convergent trait that is likely to be favored by natural selection. This work also provides evidence that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation. This is important because it suggests that the search for the “magic molecule” that underlies nectar color may be futile. Instead, the search for the “magic molecules” that underlie the evolution of vertebrate pollination may be more fruitful."

The analysis of this dataset indicates that the genetic ancestry of men from this period is similar to that of modern northern and central Europeans. However, women exhibit a very high genetic heterogeneity, including signals of genetic ancestry ranging from western Europe to East Asia. This heterogeneity is also reflected in the functional variants that we identified, which indicate that women differed in visible characteristics.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how HKU4 and HKU5 transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5.

Others have argued that it would not be possible to sustain herds if so many pocket Bibles were made from fetal skins, arguing instead for unexpected alternatives, such as rabbit. Here, we report a simple and objective method using standard conservation treatments to identify the animal origin of parchment. The noninvasive method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals. These results suggest that ultrafine vellum does not necessarily derive from the use of abortive or newborn animals with ultrathin hides, but could equally well reflect a production"

The age of the extinction is critical for understanding its cause and the controls on extinction/recovery dynamics. We present a precise age model for the extinction based on U-Pb dates from five volcanic ash beds. The age of the extinction is 251.941 ± 0.037 and 251.880 ± 0.031 Ma, an interval of 60 ± 48 ka. The carbon cycle was highly volatile immediately preceding the extinction, and the system remained volatile for ∼500 ka. The extinction was followed by a period of ecosystem reorganization, which may have contributed to the recovery of the biota. The age model presented here will allow a refined evaluation of the relative roles of rate-dependent processes contributing to the extinction, allowing insight into postextinction ecosystem expansion. This work will also provide a precise time point for evaluating the plausibility of trigger and kill mechanisms. (Abridged)"

However, the function of RORα in the intestinal epithelium (IE) is still unclear. Here, we generated intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific RORα-deficient (RORαΔIEC) mice and found that RORα is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis by attenuating nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcriptional activity. RORαΔIEC mice exhibit excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis reveals corecruitment of RORα and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) on NF-κB target promoters and subsequent dismissal of CREB binding protein (CBP) and bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) for transcriptional repression.

However, the risk of more extreme fires regionally and with implications for other ecosystem functions in fire-dependent ecosystems means that the potential benefits of reduced ignitions and suppression are not guaranteed. Our study highlights the importance of fire in the global carbon cycle and the need to better understand the feedbacks between climate, fire, and the carbon cycle.

Here we show that the squid Euprymna scolopes regulates the provision of a single glycan to its symbiotic luminescent bacterium, Vibrio fischeri, in a diel rhythm. This glycan is catabolized by the symbiont, which is thereby maintained at a constant level. The glycan is provided only at night, when the squid is active, and the catabolism of the glycan is required for the symbiont to maintain its luminescence. This is the first example of a nutrient being provided to a symbiont in a diel rhythm, and it suggests that the provision of nutrients to symbionts may be a more common phenomenon than previously thought."

The RNA encodes a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC) that increases the activity of aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GlpD). We found that overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that the RNA also base pairs with the promoter of two other genes, cadA and galE.

The contribution of anthropogenic climate change to this prolonged rainfall deficit has been estimated through observations and climate models. However, model adequacy and insufficient horizontal resolution make it difficult to precisely quantify the changing likelihood of extreme droughts, given the small regional scale. Here, we use a high-resolution large ensemble to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the probability of occurrence of multiyear SSA rainfall deficits in past and future decades. We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six.

However, the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms of ASK1 in neuroinflammation remain unknown. In this study, we generated conditional knockout (CKO) mice that lack ASK1 in microglia/macrophages, astrocytes, or T cells, and we found that ASK1 in microglia/macrophages plays a major role in neuroinflammation. ASK1 deficiency in T cells and dendritic cells had no significant effects on EAE severity. Further, we found that ASK1 in microglia/macrophages induces a proinflammatory environment, which subsequently activates astrocytes to exacerbate neuroinflammation. Our findings suggest that ASK1 in microglia/macrophages is a promising therapeutic target for reducing neuroinflammation. (PsycINFO Database Record"

The causal pathways that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility are not well understood. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

To better understand how sequential proteolysis contributes to MERS-CoV infection, we introduced mutations that blocked the first cleavages of MERS-CoV spike (S) proteins. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection, but had little effect on infection into other cell types. The cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses trafficked past cell-surface proteases and into endosomes, whereas precleaved viruses used endosomal proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry. Uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS"

The food choices of the world’s population are a key driver of this problem, and there is a need to develop effective strategies for changing these choices. This study demonstrates that increasing the proportion of vegetarian meals available in a catering operation can have a significant impact on meal selection. This approach could be used to increase the proportion of vegetarian meals available in a wide range of settings, including schools, hospitals, and workplaces. The approach is simple to implement, requires no new technology, and has low cost and minimal disruption to the catering operation. The results suggest that this approach could have a significant impact on the environment and population health. Further research is needed to understand the impact of this approach in different settings and to explore the potential for scaling up. This work has the potential to make a significant contribution to the global sustainability agenda."

We find that each oncogene has a different surfaceome, but the functions of these proteins are harmonized by common biological themes including up-regulation of nutrient transporters, down-regulation of adhesion molecules and tumor suppressing phosphatases, and alteration in immune modulators. We complement the surfaceome data with whole cell glycoproteomics enabled by a recently developed technique called activated ion electron transfer dissociation. These studies provide a broad systems-level view of how specific driver oncogenes remodel the surfaceome and the glycoproteome in a cell autologous fashion, and suggest possible surface targets, and combinations thereof, for drug and biomarker discovery.

In the adult mammalian CNS, however, neurons are largely incapable of regenerating after injury. In this study, we identify a form of regeneration in the C. elegans nervous system that is independent of the MAPK signaling pathway. This form of regeneration is triggered by physical lesion of a sensory dendrite and is enhanced by disrupting neuronal activity. We also identify a form of regeneration in the mammalian CNS that is triggered by physical lesion of a sensory dendrite and is enhanced by disrupting neuronal activity. These connections suggest that the mechanisms that control regeneration in the mammalian CNS may be conserved in the C. elegans nervous system."

The role of the recently identified cancer antigen, fibrous sheath interacting protein 1 (FSIP1), in TNBC has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 is highly expressed in TNBC and is associated with poor prognosis. FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. (PsycINFO Database Record"

We asked pairs of friends and strangers to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.” This may be why we click with some people and not with others."

We show that RSPO certification reduced deforestation in Indonesia by 33%. However, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results suggest that certification is not a panacea for tropical deforestation, but it is an important tool in the toolbox of policies to reduce tropical deforestation.

The exocytosis process is tightly regulated, and any disruption in this process can lead to significant diseases. The exocyst complex is a key regulator of the exocytosis process, and its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Less)"

In many vertebrates, sex determination is a single locus that determines the sex of the gonad and the sex of the organism. In other vertebrates, sex determination is polygenic, with multiple alleles segregating within a species. In this study, we investigate the effects of polygenic sex determination in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii, where two alleles, one of which determines female sex, and one of which determines male sex, interact to produce four possible sex classes: females with XY sex chromosomes and XX sex chromosomes, and males with XY sex chromosomes and XY sex chromosomes. We find that polygenic sex determination produces modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics, and that the introgression of a newly acquired sex determination allele produces additional axes of variation for secondary sexual characteristics. These results provide insight into the evolutionary causes and consequences of polygenic sex determination. (Simplified)"

We sought to understand how intracellular iron (Fe) impacts the retina, given that retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are also challenged by accumulations of vitamin A aldehyde adducts (bisretinoids) that photogenerate reactive oxygen species and photodecompose into damaging aldehyde- and dicarbonyls-bearing species. We found that intracellular Fe promotes bisretinoid oxidation and degradation. This interpretation was supported by experiments showing that Fe chelation decreased the oxidative/degradation of the bisretinoid A2E in the presence of light and reduced cell death in cell-based experiments. Moreover, light-independent oxidation and degradation of A2E by Fenton chemistry products were evidenced by the consumption of A2E, release of dicarbonyls, and generation of oxidized A2E species in cell-free assays. These findings suggest that Fe is a key factor in the photodegradation of bisretinoids. This knowledge may be useful in the development of therapies to protect the retina from the damaging effects of bisretinoids. (PsycINFO Database Record"

Siphonophores are pelagic colonial cnidarians that use their tentacles to capture prey. They are a model system to study the evolution of predatory morphology, as they have a high degree of specialization, and are able to capture different types of prey. We show that siphonophores have a modular prey-capture system, with each tentacle specialized for a specific prey type. We also show that the evolution of this system is linked to the evolution of the prey itself. This study contributes to our understanding of how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs."

These features are thought to have played a role in the evolution of the modern human hand and in the emergence of the genus Homo. The oldest unambiguous evidence for these features comes from the early Middle Pleistocene, but the origin of the features is likely to be earlier. Here we report the discovery of a hominin hand fossil from East Africa that provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of these features. The fossil dates to 1.42 Mya, suggesting that the features are present in the earliest members of the genus Homo. This fossil and the associated data provide new insights into the evolution of the human hand. (Less summary)"

We have developed a small-molecule inhibitor of the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), which converts serine to glycine and a folate-bound one-carbon unit. We show that this inhibitor blocks colon cancer growth in mice, and that the cancer cells are dependent upon SHMT enzymatic activity for growth. We also show that the cancer cells are uniquely dependent upon SHMT for glycine import, and that this deficiency is a targetable metabolic deficiency of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. These studies provide a foundation for the development of a therapeutic strategy for colon cancer and a metabolic strategy for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. This article is protected by copyright.

This study shows that deforestation can have a negative impact on people’s diets, and that this impact can be mitigated by the presence of forests. The results have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. This study also highlights the importance of using a causal modeling approach to understand the impact of deforestation on people’s diets. This approach is increasingly being used in the social sciences, but is still relatively new in the field of nutrition. The results of this study suggest that this approach is a valuable tool for understanding the impact of environmental change on people’s diets."

We show that the increase in mechanization has led to a significant increase in the depth of compaction, with the risk of subsoil compaction now affecting 20% of arable land. This is a major problem for agricultural productivity, and it is important to understand the causes of this trend. We show that the increase in subsoil compaction is not due to an increase in the weight of farm machinery, but rather to an increase in the size of tractors, which is a result of the increase in mechanization. This suggests that the design of farm machinery should be guided by the intrinsic mechanical limits of the soil."
