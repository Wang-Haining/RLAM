Therefore, it is important to understand the structure, synthesis, and stability of gas hydrates. Here, we report the synthesis of neon hydrate and the atomic-level structure of this material at high pressures and low temperatures. We demonstrate that neon atoms can be enclathrated in ice II-structured hydrates. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of ice channels. This work also provides direct evidence that the guest atoms can have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The results reported here will contribute to our understanding of the formation of natural gas hydrates in the earth’s crust."

But is there a deeper structure underlying the category of Hilbert spaces and linear operators? The paper shows that this is the only one up to equivalence. This addresses foundational questions raised in reconstruction programs in the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics.

In addition, we present evidence that myxozoans have the smallest known animal genomes and that these genomes have undergone extreme shrinkage and gene loss, especially in gene categories related to development and cell–cell communication. These results indicate that the transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasite was accompanied by drastic reductions in body size and genome complexity.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. We propose that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

Rising temperatures will affect global maize production, but the effect of increasing temperature variability is not well understood. We use global datasets of maize production and climate variability combined with future temperature projections to quantify how yield variability will change in the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. We find that as the global mean temperature increases, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the variability of maize yields will increase dramatically. This will lead to more frequent simultaneous production losses in the major maize-exporting countries. The resulting instability in global grain trade will affect especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes.

Decades of research have revealed several mechanisms of resource partitioning, but the extent to which herbivores partition food-plant species is unknown because comprehensive species-level identification is difficult. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant African herbivore species (six wild, one domestic). These species consumed over 700 plant species, and diet breadth was highly variable among individuals of the same species, indicating that both fine-grained and broad-scale dietary differences contribute to resource partitioning. Our results suggest that large herbivores partition food resources more finely than is currently recognized, which may facilitate coexistence without fully resolving competition. This fine-scale partitioning may be easier to study with DNA metabarcoding."

This is achieved by reduced stability of BCL11A mRNA and reduced translation of BCL11A protein.

We report that activating PI3K or loss of PTEN confers resistance to ferroptosis, and that inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis induction. Mechanistically, this resistance requires sustained activation of mTORC1 and the mTORC1-dependent induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. Our study provides a rationale for combining mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction in the treatment of PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway-altered cancers."

Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) remodeling is a pathological hallmark of chronic hypertension. L-type Ca2+ channel (Cav1.2) blockers (LCCBs) are widely used for treating hypertension. Here, we show that all three major classes of LCCBs promote VSMC remodeling through a mechanism that does not involve blocking Cav1.2 channels. Instead, LCCBs activate the Ca2+ sensor stromal-interacting molecule (STIM) by binding to an N-terminal region of STIM not involved in store-operated Ca2+ entry. This binding causes STIM to translocate to junctions and activate ORAI Ca2+ channels. Upregulated STIM in VSMCs of hypertensive rats and in patients with end-stage hypertension makes them particularly vulnerable to LCCB-induced VSMC remodeling. Our findings indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling."

Insects, however, have evolved the ability to digest lignocellulose, enabling them to feed on a wide variety of plant tissues and thereby to become the most diverse group of animals. We show that the ancestor of all beetles acquired genes from bacteria and fungi that enable the digestion of lignocellulose, allowing the beetle lineage to diversify into more than 350,000 species today. Our analyses of the most comprehensive phylogenomic datasets for beetles reveal that horizontal gene transfers of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes from microorganisms triggered the evolution of remarkably specialized plant-feeding habits, including leaf mining and stem and wood boring.

We solve this problem by using a combination of the Bethe ansatz and of the quasiparticle picture. Our result shows that the entanglement entropy behaves as a thermodynamic entropy in the long-time limit and that the dynamics of entanglement is a manifestation of the emergence of thermodynamics in isolated quantum systems. Our approach is exact and applies to finite systems without taking the thermodynamic limit. Our result is exact and provides the dynamics of the entanglement entropy in interacting quantum systems.

During the Second Pandemic (14th to 19th centuries CE), plague spread rapidly through Europe, causing high mortality and recurrent epidemics for hundreds of years. Here, we use mathematical modeling to show that human ectoparasites, such as human fleas or body lice, were likely the primary vectors during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346–1353), and that rats were less important. This challenges the assumption that rats and rat fleas were the primary source of historical plague epidemics.

We use single-molecule techniques to study severing under controlled mechanical conditions. We discover that ADF/cofilin can induce a mechanical torque on a filament segment, simply because it is constrained to not rotate. This torque strongly boosts the severing of interconnected filaments, which is likely to be critical for their efficient disassembly in cells.

Recently, biochemical analyses have identified secreted small ALK-like proteins (ALKALS) as potential ligands for human ALK and the related leukocyte tyrosine kinase (LTK). We show that zebrafish ALKALS potently activate zebrafish LTK and human ALK driving downstream signaling events. Overexpression of zebrafish ALKALS causes ectopic iridophore development in zebrafish embryos, whereas loss of the ALKALS leads to the loss of iridophores. Our results provide in vivo evidence of (i) activation of ALK/LTK family receptors by ALKALs and (ii) an involvement of these ligand–receptor complexes in neural crest development. As human ALK is targeted by drugs in cancer therapy, the zebrafish model may be used to study ALKAL-dependent biology in vivo."

Nesocodon mauritianus produces a blood-red nectar that has been proposed to serve as a visual attractant for pollinator visitation. Here, we show that the nectar’s red color is derived from a previously undescribed alkaloid termed nesocodin. The first nectar produced is acidic and pale yellow in color, but slowly becomes alkaline before taking on its characteristic red color. Three enzymes secreted into the nectar are either necessary or sufficient for pigment production.

Their color is not due to pigments in their skin, but rather to a protein never described before in vertebrates. This protein is a member of the serpin superfamily, the largest and most ubiquitous group of protease inhibitors. How did this happen? Frogs have a unique mechanism to detoxify and recycle biliverdin, a molecule that gives the color to chlorophyll and is a product of hemoglobin catabolism. This recycling process makes biliverdin available to bind to serpins, which in turn change their conformation and absorption spectra. This study shows that the evolution of chlorosis in anurans (frogs and toads) has happened several times during their evolutionary history and relies on this serpin. The described function is a remarkable functional diversification for a serpin."

RORα-deficient mice exhibit excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model.

These more open conformations facilitate binding to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2, and the subsequent structural rearrangements required for viral membrane fusion. We also find that the D614G mutation is associated with a faster rate of pseudovirus membrane fusion. Thus, we provide a structural explanation for why the G614 variant appears to be more infectious.

A major obstacle for finding or even deciding upon the existence of rational (i.e., equilibrium) strategies in repeated games is the huge strategy space, which is exponentially larger than the state space. This obstacle is avoided in stochastic games and in Borel games, where the strategy space is the same as the state space. We show that a middle ground between repeated games and stochastic games exists: one can allow strategies that depend on the entire history of the game, as in repeated games, but restrict the payoff function so that it depends only on the asymptotic behavior of the play, as in Borel games. The resulting class of games has polynomial-size strategy spaces and admits equilibria."

Globally, changes in fire have warmed climate throughout most of the 20th century. However, reductions in fire activity may reverse this, enhancing land carbon uptake and offsetting ∼5 to 10 y of global CO2 emissions at today’s levels. This reduces warming by up to 0.11 °C by 2100.

Synthesizing a global dataset of soil respiration measurements from 27 warming experiments spanning nine biomes, we find that the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration is largely unchanged with experimental warming. Moreover, across all nondesert biomes, respiration rates with and without experimental warming follow a Gaussian response, increasing with soil temperature up to a threshold of ∼25 °C, above which respiration rates decrease with further increases in temperature. These results demonstrate that rising global temperatures may result in regionally variable responses in soil respiration, with colder climates being considerably more responsive to increased ambient temperatures compared with warmer regions."

We show that plastid genomes evolve under relaxed functional constraints linked to the parasitic lifestyle. The functional reduction of plastid genomes is stepwise, and the evolutionary rates evolve in parallel, reaching several new rate equilibria. The establishment of the parasitic lifestyle is preceded by a long period of accelerated evolution and extensive gene losses. Our results suggest that the transition to parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner. The functional reduction of plastids is a major event in the evolution of land plants that has triggered accelerated genome erosion and molecular evolutionary rate changes. These changes are linked to the parasitic lifestyle rather than the loss of photosynthesis."

We use a high-resolution climate model to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the probability of such an event. We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% by the year 2100 under an intermediate-emission scenario and to 80% under a high-emission scenario. This shows that the drought risk in southwestern South Africa is strongly sensitive to future anthropogenic emissions. Our results will be valuable for planning adaptation strategies to cope with future extremes in this vulnerable region.

Recent studies have highlighted the spreading of protein aggregates in major neurodegenerative diseases, but the mechanisms underlying this spreading and whether it is related to disease pathology are poorly understood. We demonstrate that huntingtin aggregates accumulate at synaptic terminals and progressively spread throughout the Drosophila brain. These aggregates are internalized and accumulate in other neurons, causing loss of vulnerable neurons. The release of aggregates requires N-ethylmalemide–sensitive fusion protein 1, and aggregate spreading and endocytosis inhibition can prevent neuronal loss. These findings demonstrate that protein aggregates are actively released and internalized in vivo and that this process is pathogenic. Therefore, aggregate spreading may be an important therapeutic target."

This mutualism is characterized by a daily rhythmic exchange of signals between the partners, which culminates in a daily light display by the squid. We show here that the provision of a single glycan, chitin, by the host at night is a key signal that enables the symbionts to alter their metabolic activity and to produce light in the host organ. This result suggests that the strategic provision of glycans by their hosts may be an important mechanism by which animal hosts regulate the activities of their epithelial microbiota. Chitin is a major component of the exoskeleton of insects, which are a major source of food for squid in the wild. The squid’s provision of chitin to its microbiota may therefore also benefit the squid."

This movement of fluid is mediated by the water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4), which is expressed in brain cells called astrocytes.

The response of the coral holobiont to heat stress is characterized by a gradual breakdown of the symbiosis. This process is driven by the increasing metabolic energy demand of the coral host, which is compensated by the catabolic degradation of amino acids and the resulting shift from net uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont. This shift in nutrient cycling promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates.

However, the role of FSIP1 in the progression and drug sensitivity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies."

The ether lipid metabolic pathway is known to be regulated by the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) in mammalian cells. The present study shows that intracellular alkylglycerol monooxygenase activity is an important regulator of alkylglycerol metabolism in murine RAW264.7 macrophage-like cells. It was found that alkylglycerol monooxygenase is expressed and active also in primary mouse bone marrow-derived monocytes and “alternatively activated” M2 macrophages obtained by interleukin 4 treatment, but almost missing in M1 macrophages obtained by IFN-γ and lipopolysaccharide treatment. This study demonstrates a central role of tetrahydrobiopterin and alkylglycerol monooxygenase in ether lipid metabolism of murine macrophages. It reveals that alteration of alkylglycerol monooxygenase activity has a profound impact on the lipidome also beyond the class of ether lipids.

The model is based on recent experimental findings that neurons in the cortex change their intrinsic excitability in response to experience. The model is unique in providing a neural mechanism of working memory that is grounded in dynamic changes of neuronal excitability. It does not rely on persistent activity or synaptic plasticity for storage. The model is predictive and can be tested in future experiments. It provides a bridge between the cognitive science of language and the neuroscience of the cortex. It is a step toward a computational neurobiology of language.

However, their application in plants has not been explored. The plant cell wall is an additional obstacle for external molecule delivery to plant cells. Here, we demonstrate the internalization of DNA nanostructures in plant cells and their application as vehicles for small interfering RNA to silence the endogenous gene in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. We show that internalization and gene silencing efficiency depend on the DNA nanostructure size, shape, and stiffness. The gene silencing mechanism also depends on the location of siRNA attachment on the DNA nanostructure. Our work opens up the possibility of using DNA nanostructures as vehicles for plant cell delivery.

We found that smaller tributaries deliver relatively more nutrients per unit area than larger tributaries and that these nutrients are more bioavailable (dissolved inorganic nutrients). This suggests that small watersheds may have a greater potential to fuel algal blooms in coastal areas. The higher bioavailability of nutrients from small watersheds also means that their impacts may extend beyond the immediate coastal zone. Our findings reveal an underappreciated role that small streams may play in driving coastal eutrophication in large water bodies. Expanding nutrient management efforts to address smaller watersheds could reduce the ecological impacts of nutrient loading on valuable nearshore ecosystems.

Here, we show that NMDAR-Abs change intrinsic cortical connections and neuronal population dynamics to alter spontaneous EEG activity and predispose brain dynamics to paroxysmal abnormalities. We develop a dynamic causal model of NMDAR-Ab effects on cortical microcircuitry and use this model to identify key synaptic parameters that best explain EEG paroxysms in pediatric patients with NMDAR-Ab encephalitis.

This event is characterized by a rapid doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations, a large-scale injection of organic matter into the deep ocean, and a negative C isotope excursion. These changes were caused by the rapid release of organic-rich sediments and led to widespread seafloor anoxia, which further enhanced the release of C to the atmosphere.
