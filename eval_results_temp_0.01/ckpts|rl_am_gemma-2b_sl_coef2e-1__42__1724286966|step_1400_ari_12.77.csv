The evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, and a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species and a less reduced cnidarian species. Our results show that the myxozoan body plan evolved from a free-living cnidarian and that the extreme degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by a reduction in genome size and gene content. Our findings provide insights into the molecular basis of the transition from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic cnidarian. (Show more)"

The virus has been shown to antagonize the antiviral action of interferon (IFN) by blocking nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 uses a viral accessory protein, Orf6, to block nuclear import of importin/karyopherin. We demonstrate that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and binds to the Nup98-Rae1 complex, which is required for nuclear import of importin/karyopherin. We further show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its antagonistic function. Our findings provide a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This mechanism may be exploited by other viruses to evade IFN signaling. Our findings may also provide a target for the development of new antiviral strategies.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. Sperm cells are quiescent in the male reproductive system due to Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1 channels, but become active once introduced into the low-Zn2+-concentration environment of the female reproductive tract. How Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide"

This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and to a decrease in mean yields. The probability that the top four maize-exporting countries have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming.

This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. This sink may be of major importance in the fate of the missing plastic debris."

No treatment is currently available to slow down the aggressive neurodegenerative process, and patients die within a few years after disease onset. The cytopathological hallmark of MSA is the accumulation of alpha-synuclein (α-syn) aggregates in affected oligodendrocytes. Several studies point to α-syn oligomerization and aggregation as a mediator of neurotoxicity in synucleinopathies including MSA. Here we show that the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 is able to limit the progressive toxicity of α-syn aggregation in a mouse model of MSA. VX-765 was able to reduce truncated α-syn, its monomeric and oligomeric forms, and preserve tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in the substantia nigra. These results suggest that VX-765 is a promising candidate to achieve disease modification in synucleinopathies by limiting α-syn accumulation. This would be a major step forward in the treatment of MSA. VX-765 is well tolerated in a 6 wk-long phase II trial in patients with epilepsy.

A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious individuals.

Despite recent advances in cancer treatment, the overall survival of cancer patients remains poor. One of the major reasons for this poor outcome is the emergence of cancer drug resistance. In this study, we identified a mechanism of resistance to ferroptosis, a form of regulated necrosis driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. We found that the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) function, highly frequent events in human cancer, confers ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells. This resistance is mediated by sustained activation of mTORC1 and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)C1-dependent induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. In conclusion, our findings suggest that targeting the mTOR pathway in combination with ferroptosis induction may be a promising strategy for cancer treatment. This strategy may be applicable to other forms of regulated necrosis, such as apoptosis. (Read more)"

We show that the NWFP had little effect on the conservation of older-forest–associated birds, but did halt the decline of early-seral–associated birds. However, the NWFP failed to halt the decline of older-forest–associated bird populations, and the early-seral ecosystem area declined in two ecoregions. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure."

We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data. This work provides a new perspective on the design of deep convolutional neural networks. It is expected to be useful in many image-processing applications."

These results demonstrate that evening exposure to an LE-eBook phase-delays the circadian clock, acutely suppresses melatonin, and has important implications for understanding the impact of such technologies on sleep, performance, health, and safety.

We used a comprehensive dataset of 89 genes to estimate the timing and rates of beetle diversification, and a comprehensive dataset of 154 genomes or transcriptomes to trace the evolution of beetle genes enabling symbiont-independent digestion of lignocellulose. Phylogenomic analyses of these uniquely comprehensive datasets resolved previously controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, these novel genes triggered adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding PCWDEs.

Population size was manipulated such that participants could learn from the paper planes constructed by one, two, or four models from the prior generation. These social-learning conditions were compared with an asocial individual-learning condition in which individual participants made repeated attempts at constructing a paper plane, without having access to any planes produced by other participants.

Here, we report a novel role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes. We also found that APOE alleles affect the accumulation of senescent synapses in the brain. These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes. They also suggest the hypothesis that APOE4 may be associated with defective phagocytic capacity of astrocytes which accelerates the rate of accumulation of senescent synapses, enhancing synaptic vulnerability to classical-complement-cascade mediated neurodegeneration.

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal cells is not well understood. We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This study also provides a rationale for the development of TRAP1-targeted therapies. (Read more)"

They are dynamic structures that can be assembled and disassembled. The disassembly process is controlled by proteins that bind and unbind to actin filaments. One of these proteins is cofilin, which is involved in many cellular processes, including cell motility. However, the mechanism by which cofilin disassembles actin filaments is not well understood. Here, we show that cofilin can induce torque on actin filaments, which enhances the rate of severing. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost cofilin’s ability to disassemble highly connected actin filaments in cells. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of the role of cofilin in cell motility. They also suggest a way to control the disassembly of highly connected filament networks, which is important in many applications, including tissue engineering."

However, the cellular response to such stress is often accompanied by the inactivation of the enzymes responsible for decapping Np4-capped RNAs. Here, we show that, in Escherichia coli cells experiencing such stress, the RNA pyrophosphohydrolase RppH assumes a leading role in decapping those transcripts, preferring them as substrates over their triphosphorylated and diphosphorylated counterparts. This enzyme recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5′ termini, resulting in a one-nucleotide shift in substrate specificity. The unconventional manner in which RppH recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress.

Female-derived proteins also begin to associate with sperm immediately after mating, and they comprise nearly 20% of the postmating sperm proteome following 4 d of storage in the female reproductive tract.

The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We induced C-type inactivation in BK channels and studied the relationship between activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery. We observed prominent slow C-type inactivation/recovery in BK channels by an extreme low concentration of extracellular K+ together with a Y294E/K/Q/S or Y279F mutation whose equivalent in Shaker channels (T449E/K/D/Q/S or W434F) caused a greatly accelerated rate of C-type inactivation or constitutive C-inactivation.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. First, whereas MERS-CoV prefers human DPP4 over bat DPP4 as its receptor, HKU4 shows the opposite trend. Second, in the absence of exogenous proteases, both MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes mediate pseudovirus entry into bat cells, whereas only MERS-CoV spike, but not HKU4 spike, mediates pseudovirus entry into human cells. Thus, MERS-CoV, but not HKU4, has adapted to"

We found that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion.

We also show that the glycan is provisioned only at night, when the squid is active and the symbiont is producing light. This glycan is catabolized by the symbiont, which uses the resulting carbon and energy to increase the pH of the luminescent crypts. This work provides a new perspective on the regulation of symbiosis dynamics and the potential for glycans to be used as a tool to manipulate the activities of specific microbes in the body.

Despite advances in therapy, the prognosis of AML patients remains poor. The IL1RAP (IL1R3) is expressed on candidate leukemic stem cells in the majority of AML patients, but not on normal hematopoietic stem cells. We show here that monoclonal antibodies targeting IL1RAP have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This study also provides a proof-of-concept for the use of IL1RAP as"

These proteins aggregate and spread throughout the brain, causing damage to vulnerable neurons. However, the mechanisms underlying this spreading are poorly understood. Here we use a fluorescently tagged polyglutamine-expanded form of human huntingtin to monitor the spread of aggregates in a Drosophila model of Huntington’s disease. We show that aggregates accumulate at synaptic terminals and progressively spread throughout the brain. These aggregates are internalized and accumulate within other neurons. We also show that the release of aggregates requires N-ethylmalemide–sensitive fusion protein 1, demonstrating that active release and uptake of aggregates are important elements of spreading and disease progression. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the spread of aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases. This work also provides a model system for studying the spread of aggregates in the brain. (Show more)"

Here we identify a scaffold that inhibits SHMT, and we use this scaffold to discover dual inhibitors of SHMT1/2. We show that these inhibitors are effective in cancer cells, but not in normal cells. We also show that one of the adverse effects of SHMT inhibition is defective glycine import into cancer cells. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of cancer."

Here, we show that the proteins that are characteristic of each of these subtypes are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of the proteins in question, which are themselves supersaturated. Rather, the proteins that are characteristic of each of the ALS subtypes are coaggregating with each other, even though they are not in the native interaction network of any of the proteins. We propose that this is the result of a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. This study provides a new perspective on the neuropathology of ALS and suggests a mechanism for the development of the disease. (Read more)"

The study of more than 1,000 specimens of Montsechia, including a detailed description of its anatomy, suggests that Montsechia is sister to Ceratophyllum, a group that is sister to eudicots. Montsechia is Barremian in age, raising questions about the very early divergence of the Ceratophyllum clade compared with its position as sister to eudicots in many cladistic analyses. Lower Cretaceous aquatic angiosperms, such as Archaefructus and Montsechia, open the possibility that aquatic plants were locally common at a very early stage of angiosperm evolution and that aquatic habitats may have played a major role in the diversification of some early angiosperm lineages.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Virions must first be cleaved sequentially by cell-surface proteases, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. We found that the first cleavages are significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence. Without the first cleavages, MERS viruses resisted conformational changes that are induced by cell receptors, and therefore were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures. These findings suggest that the first cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence.

However, the generation of ECs has been difficult, and the minimum number of transcription factors that directly induce EC development remains undefined. Here, we demonstrate that ets variant 2 (ETV2) alone can induce the formation of functional vascular ECs (ETVECs) from primary human adult skin fibroblasts. ETV2-induced ETVECs exhibit EC characteristics in vitro and form mature functional vasculature in vivo. Furthermore, ETVECs significantly improve blood flow recovery in a hind limb ischemic model using BALB/c-nu mice. Our study indicates that the creation of ETVECs provides further understanding of human EC development induced by ETV2. This approach may be useful for the treatment of vascular disorders.

Recently, two physiological ligands for Alk and Ltk were discovered. Here, we use zebrafish as a model system to explore the physiological function and to characterize in vivo links between Alk and Ltk with their ligands. We show that the augmentor ligands play an important role in zebrafish pigment development. Deficiency in augmentor ligands results in strong impairment in iridophore patterning of embryonic and adult zebrafish that is phenocopied in zebrafish deficient in Ltk. These experiments establish a physiological link between augmentor ligands and Ltk and demonstrate that particular augmentors activate Ltk in a tissue-specific context to induce iridophore differentiation from neural crest-derived cells and pigment progenitor cells. This work provides insights into the physiological function of Alk and Ltk and their ligands in vivo. It also provides a model system for studying the function of other orphan RTKs in vivo.

Insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction are two main molecular bases yet to be further elucidated for T2D. Accumulating evidence indicates that stimulator of interferon genes (STING) plays an important role in regulating insulin sensitivity. However, its function in β-cells remains unknown. Herein, using global STING knockout (STING−/−) and β-cell–specific STING knockout (STING-βKO) mouse models, we revealed a distinct role of STING in the regulation of glucose homeostasis through peripheral tissues and β-cells. Specially, although STING−/− beneficially alleviated insulin resistance and glucose intolerance induced by high-fat diet, it surprisingly impaired islet glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Importantly, STING-βKO caused glucose intolerance due to impaired GSIS, indicating that STING is required for normal β-cell function. Islet transcriptome analysis showed that STING deficiency decreased expression of β-cell function–related genes, including Glut2, Kcnj11, and Abcc8, contributing to impaired GSIS.

Here, we identified a direct interaction between two viral RNA segments of an influenza A virus. We show that this interaction is required for optimal viral replication and that it favors copackaging of the interacting RNA segments. Our results indicate that the interaction between viral RNA segments is a key step in the packaging process and suggest that it might be a target for antiviral therapy.

We show that humans have vastly expanded the spatial and seasonal “fire niche” in the United States, accounting for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. Human-caused wildfires disproportionally occurred where fuel moisture was higher than lightning-started fires, thereby helping expand the geographic and seasonal niche of wildfire.

Our results suggest that urban planners and policymakers can use these methods to identify neighborhoods that are likely to experience physical improvements and to target resources to these neighborhoods. Our results also suggest that urban change is not a simple process of “invasion” or “tipping,” but rather a complex process that involves both the “invasion” and the “tipping” of attractive neighborhoods.

Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

However, these factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. First, more diverse communities have a greater chance of including species with thermal traits that enable them to maintain productivity as temperatures shift from ambient conditions. Second, we found a pronounced increase in the contribution of complementarity to the net biodiversity effect at high and low temperatures, indicating that changes in species interactions played a critical role in mediating the impacts of temperature change on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. This work highlights the importance of considering the combined effects of biodiversity loss and environmental warming on ecosystem functioning. This is critical for the development of effective conservation"

In this study, we show that the FT gene in the rootless parasitic plant Cuscuta australis does not function in flowering. Instead, flowering is controlled by a mechanism that is unique to this plant. The flowering of the host plant is required for the movement of FT protein into the parasitic plant, where it physically interacts with a dodder FD transcription factor to activate flowering. This study demonstrates that FTs can function as an important interplant flowering signal in host–dodder interactions. The unique means of flowering regulation of dodder illustrates how regressive evolution, commonly found in parasites, may facilitate the physiological synchronization of parasite and host, here allowing the C. australis parasite to time reproduction exactly with that of their hosts, likely optimizing parasite fitness. This study provides a new perspective on the evolution of flowering and the evolution of parasitism.

Here, we describe a previously unidentified type of specialized integration unit within the dopamine-containing nigral system. These striatonigral bouquet-like formations, here termed “striosome–dendron bouquets,” are composed of striosomal fibers and dopamine-containing dendrites. They are connected to the striatum as part of the classic nigrostriatal pathway. Within the bouquets, many striosomal fibers are tightly intertwined with dopamine-containing dendrites and also with other types of afferents and glial cells. We suggest that the striosome–dendron bouquets form specialized integrative units within the dopamine-containing nigral system. Given evidence that striosomes receive input from cortical regions related to the control of mood and motivation and that they link functionally to reinforcement and decision-making, the striosome–dendron bouquets could be critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease.

Here, we report that stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and Orai1 channels, key components of store-operated Ca2+ entry, are selectively expressed in SANCs. Cardiac-specific deletion of STIM1 in mice resulted in depletion of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ stores of SANCs and led to SAN dysfunction, as was evident by a reduction in heart rate, sinus arrest, and an exaggerated autonomic response to cholinergic signaling. Moreover, STIM1 influenced SAN function by regulating ionic fluxes in SANCs, including activation of a store-operated Ca2+ current, a reduction in L-type Ca2+ current, and enhancing the activities of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. These studies reveal that STIM1 is a multifunctional regulator of Ca2+ dynamics in SANCs that links SR Ca2+ store content with electrical events occurring in the plasma membrane"

We found that the 6 largest tributaries accounted for ∼70% of the daily nitrogen and phosphorus delivered to Lake Michigan. However, small tributaries exhibited nutrient loads that were high for their size and biased toward dissolved inorganic forms.

One of the key metabolic pathways supporting cell growth is the one-carbon unit biosynthetic pathway. This pathway is supported by the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). SHMT is a promising target for cancer therapy, but its inhibition is associated with adverse effects. Here we identify a scaffold that inhibits SHMT, and we use this scaffold to discover dual inhibitors of SHMT1/2. We show that these inhibitors are effective in cancer cells, but not in normal cells. We also show that one of the adverse effects of SHMT inhibition is defective glycine import into cancer cells. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of cancer."

This study shows that deforestation can reduce people’s consumption of fruits and vegetables and thus their vitamin A adequacy. Conversely, forest fragmentation can increase people’s consumption of fruits and vegetables and thus their vitamin A adequacy. These findings have important implications for policy makers, who should consider the role of forests in improving people’s diets as well as their conservation and environmental benefits."

We show that the increase in compaction risk has been so severe that it has now reached a critical threshold for ecological functioning. We propose that the roaming of sauropods, the largest terrestrial animals to have walked Earth, may have been a strategy for reducing subsoil compaction."
