Here, we present a comparative analysis of the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species and a cnidarian species. Our results suggest that the extreme reduction in genome size and gene content in the Myxozoa was accompanied by a reduction in the complexity of the body plan. This is the first report of a genome size smaller than 100 Mbp in an animal. Our results provide insights into the origin of the Myxozoa and the evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic one. (Show more)"

Here, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species in semiarid African savanna. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers, and dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This study highlights the need for more comprehensive diet analyses in future studies of LMH coexistence. (Show more)"

The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. The predicted best candidate is more accessible, exhibits higher solubility and binding affinity to the ribosome, and is up to 56 times more active than telithromycin. This study provides a proof of concept for the rational design of new antibiotics. The approach presented here can be extended to other antibiotic classes and to other targets. This will enable the development of new antibiotics for the treatment of antibiotic-resistant infections. (PsycINFO Database Record"

The architecture is based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales, and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters. The proposed architecture is expected to be useful for many image-processing problems in the future."

Here, we report a novel role for APOE in controlling the rate of astrocytic phagocytosis of synapses, which is highly dependent on APOE isoform. We also found that APOE alleles affect the rate of C1q accumulation in hippocampus, which may represent the accumulation of senescent synapses with enhanced vulnerability to complement-mediated degeneration. These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes. They also suggest the hypothesis that AD susceptibility of APOE4 may originate in part from defective phagocytic capacity of astrocytes which accelerates the rate of accumulation of C1q-coated senescent synapses, enhancing synaptic vulnerability to classical-complement-cascade mediated neurodegeneration. These studies provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of APOE in AD and suggest a potential therapeutic target for AD treatment."

The vaccine is temperature sensitive in vitro, yet grows robustly at the permissive temperature.

However, the earliest stages of the disease, when plaques are absent, are associated with a plaque-independent inflammatory response. Here, we show that neurons, which are the primary cell type responsible for the production of amyloid, are also the source of the earliest inflammatory response in AD. Our results suggest that the accumulation of soluble and oligomeric amyloid species in neurons may be a significant contributor to the AD pathogenesis."

The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also found that BK channel C-type inactivation is state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation.

We find that the wispy, wheel-shaped orb web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to capture the sound-induced air particle movements that approach the maximum physical efficiency better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By sensing the motion of web threads, the spider remotely detects and localizes the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave, such as those emitted by approaching prey or predators. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound"

However, their assessments are subjective and categorical, and thus difficult to use in quantitative analyses. We show how to transform the original data into a continuous, probabilistic variable that is better suited to quantitative analysis. We also show that the CPC data are statistically robust and maintain similar characteristics across different crops, exhibit long-term stability, and have nation-wide validity. We discuss the origin and interpretation of existing spatial and temporal biases in the survey data. Finally, we propose a quantitative Crop Condition Index based on the CPC survey and demonstrate how this index can be used to monitor crop status and provide earlier and more precise predictions of crop yields than official USDA forecasts released midseason. The proposed methodology can be easily extended to other countries and crops.

Here we propose a mechanism that supports memory for linguistic information. This mechanism is based on the adaptive changes in the excitability of neurons that are driven by the activity of the network. This adaptive process is able to store information in a form that can be accessed and processed without the need for cued retrieval. This work provides a computational neurobiology of language that is based on a mechanism that is sensitive to context and serial order. It is also able to capture the effects of interference within memory. This work is a step toward a computational neurobiology of language.

In this study, we provide a synthesis of the largest global dataset to date of soil respiration measurements, spanning nine biomes and over 2 decades of experimental warming. Our analysis reveals that the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration does not change with warming in most biomes, but that respiration rates with and without warming follow a Gaussian response, increasing with soil temperature up to a threshold of ∼25 °C, above which respiration rates decrease with further increases in temperature. These results provide a unique cross-biome perspective on the temperature response of soil respiration, information critical to improving our mechanistic understanding of how soil carbon dynamics change with climatic warming.

The results also highlight the importance of regional climate variability in the occurrence of droughts in SSA. The results of this study are of relevance to the water resources of the region and to the global climate change community.

We used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a framework for understanding the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. It also provides a potential target for the development of a Drosophila model of autism. (PsycINFO Database Record"

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis remain unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We found that the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop). The Pro-Gate loop faces toward the minor groove of RNA:DNA hybrid and is involved in modulating the translocation of minor-groove alkylated DNA template after nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion. Taken together, this work provides important mechanistic insights into transcriptional stalling, lesion bypass, and mutagenesis of alkyl"

They also contribute to the development of a broader perspective on predatory niche diversification via morphological innovation and evolution."

The fossil record of the hominin hand is incomplete, however, and the origin of some of the most distinctive features of the modern human hand is not well understood. We report the discovery of a hominin hand fossil from East Africa that preserves a key derived feature of the human hand, the third metacarpal styloid process. This fossil provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of this feature and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo. This study thus contributes to our understanding of the evolution of the hominin hand and its relationship to the Neandertal hand. (Less)"

We have developed a series of small-molecule inhibitors of the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase, which converts serine to glycine and a folate cycle intermediate. We show that these inhibitors are effective in vitro and in vivo, and that they are particularly effective in B-cell cancers. We also show that one-carbon unit deficiency is a targetable metabolic deficiency of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Thus, we have developed a series of small-molecule inhibitors of a key metabolic enzyme, and have identified a targetable metabolic deficiency of a cancer type. This work represents a significant advance in the development of cancer therapeutics."

The results show that deforestation has a negative impact on people’s diets, which is likely to have implications for their vitamin A status. The results also show that forest fragmentation has a positive impact on people’s diets, which is likely to have implications for their vitamin A status. The results have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. This study also highlights the importance of using a modeling approach to test causal hypotheses, which is rarely done in nutrition research. We believe that this study will be of interest to researchers and policy makers alike."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We hypothesize that the unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the largest sauropods, the brachiosaurs, had the largest footprints, which are consistent with the idea of roaming over fixed trails. Our results suggest that the ecological strategies of sauropods may have guided the design of their mechanical equivalents. This is a significant finding, as it suggests that the design of farm machinery may have been guided by the ecological strategies of the dinosaurs."
