Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals.

This problem can be addressed by the development of new antibacterial agents to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. In this work, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. The results of this work are expected to contribute to the development of new antibiotics and to the improvement of the current treatment of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens.

We used a combination of genomic and fossil data to trace the evolution of beetles and to estimate the timing and rates of beetle diversification. Our analyses resolved previously controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, both major independent origins of specialized herbivory in beetles coincide with the first appearances of an arsenal of PCWDEs encoded in their genomes. Beetle diversity thus appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding PCWDEs.

These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes.

We used a grid-based approach to sample the genomic diversity across the island, which allowed us to study the genetic history of Madagascar in a way that was not possible before. We find that Madagascar was settled by a Bantu and Austronesian population, with a limited contribution from Europe and the Middle East. The settlement happened recently, and the genetic structure is the result of a combination of admixture and demographic growth. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia. In addition, a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. Our results provide a better understanding of the history of Madagascar and the Indian Ocean region. They also provide a framework for the study of the genetic history of other islands and the Indian Ocean region.

However, the immune response in AD is often attributed to sustained microglial activation in response to Aβ deposits and cell death. Here, we show that neurons, which are the primary cell type in the brain responsible for Aβ production, are also the source of an immune response. This neuron-derived inflammatory profile is unique to Aβ-burdened neurons, and it correlates with the extent of microglial activation and mobilization. We also demonstrate that the human brain contains a neuron-specific inflammatory response, which may precede the formation of Aβ plaques and tau tangles. Thus, we propose that the intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ may be a significant immunological component in the AD pathogenesis. This study provides a new perspective on the role of the immune system in AD, and it may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. (PsycINFO Database Record"

This is the earliest known evidence for economic exploitation of chickens in the world. We further show that the earliest secure evidence for economic exploitation of chickens in Europe dates to the first century B.C.E. and therefore is predated by the finds in the Southern Levant by at least a century.

We find that neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements. Neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities. Our results also provide a new method for monitoring the physical appearance of neighborhoods over time. This method can be used to monitor the effects of urban revitalization efforts and to study the physical dynamics of cities."

The method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals, but we did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides.

The virus is present in the plankton, sediments, and in nonasteroid echinoderms, suggesting that it can spread over long distances. The virus has been present in museum specimens of asteroids for at least 72 y, indicating that it has been present on the North American Pacific Coast for a long time. This study provides evidence that a virus is responsible for the mass mortality of asteroids."

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. Our findings provide a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility in autism and may facilitate the development of new therapeutic approaches. (PsycINFO Database Record"

To better understand the mechanisms of MERS-CoV infection, we engineered viruses with mutations that blocked sequential proteolysis. These mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence. These findings may help to guide the development of effective vaccines and antiviral therapies. (PsycINFO Database Record"

We also show that the antiviral treatment favipiravir can reduce the peak median viral load and shorten the time to undetectable median viral load, whereas treatment given 2 d postinfection is mostly ineffective in accelerating plasma viral load loss. These results can be used to guide the development of effective treatment strategies for ZIKV. (Show more)"

However, they are threatened by a variety of environmental stressors, including climate change. In the context of global warming, the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis is one of the most feared consequences of mass bleaching events. We show that the metabolic and molecular responses of the coral host to heat stress are driven by altered nutrient cycling, which in turn is a consequence of the heat stress-induced metabolic stress. Our findings provide insights into the stability of the coral–algal symbiosis and may help us to understand the mechanisms underlying the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis in the context of climate change. This may ultimately help us to develop strategies for reef conservation."

We show that striosomal fibers form bouquet-like arborizations that target bundles of ventrally extending dopamine-containing dendrites and clusters of their parent nigral cell bodies. These clustered cell bodies in turn project to the striatum as part of the classic nigrostriatal pathway. Thus, these striosome–dendron bouquets likely represent subsystems with the nigro–striato–nigral loop that are affected in human disorders including Parkinson’s disease. Given evidence that striosomes receive input from cortical regions related to the control of mood and motivation and that they link functionally to reinforcement and decision-making, the striosome–dendron bouquets could be critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease."

Here, we report the delivery of siRNA to plants using DNA nanostructures. We show that the size, shape, compactness, stiffness, and attachment location of the DNA nanostructures are important design parameters for the delivery of siRNA to plant cells. We also show that the delivery of siRNA to plant cells is dependent on the endogenous gene silencing pathway. Our work establishes the feasibility of DNA nanostructures for the delivery of biomolecules to plants and the importance of the design parameters for the delivery of biomolecules to plants.

We show that the 6 largest tributaries of Lake Michigan account for ∼70% of the daily nutrient loads delivered to the lake. However, the nutrient loads from small tributaries were high for their size, and the nutrients were in the form of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus. This suggests that the nutrient plumes from small tributaries may overlap in the nearshore zone, increasing the potential for coastal eutrophication. Our findings highlight the importance of small tributaries in driving coastal nutrient loading, and they suggest that nutrient management efforts should focus on these sources to reduce the ecological impacts of nutrient loading on valuable nearshore ecosystems."

However, the history of C perturbations during abrupt warming events is poorly understood. Here, we present a study of a C perturbation and global warming event that occurred during a paleo-glacial state. We show that the event was linked to an injection of organic matter–derived C and to an increase in nutrient fluxes. Our study provides insights into the history of C perturbations during abrupt warming events and the potential impact of such events on the Earth system. This information is critical for understanding the potential impacts of future abrupt warming events. (Less)"

We show that RSPO certification is associated with reduced deforestation in oil palm plantations, but that most plantations are too small to have a significant impact on deforestation. We also show that certification has no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results suggest that certification is not a silver bullet for reducing tropical deforestation, but it is an important tool in the toolbox. We hope that our results will help to inform the development of future certification schemes. (Less)"

In species with polygenic sex determination, multiple alleles are segregating at this locus, and the sex of an individual can be different from the sex of the species. We show that the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii has four possible genotypes at the sex locus, which results in four possible sexes: females, males, XX females, and XY males. We show that the modularity of secondary sexual characteristics in M. mbenjii is a result of the polygenic sex determination system, and we discuss the evolutionary consequences of this modularity."

This effect is rooted in defective glycine import, and thus defective glycine metabolism, in these cancer cell lines. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of cancer cells."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants."
