The most promising approach is to use the language of category theory, which has been successfully applied to other foundational problems in mathematics. However, the mathematical structure of Hilbert space, on which the category of operators on it is built, is not directly accessible to intuition. This paper provides a set of axioms for the category of continuous linear operators on Hilbert space, which are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. The axioms are then shown to be equivalent to the existence of a universal property for this category. This provides a mathematical foundation for the reconstruction of quantum mechanics from the category of Hilbert spaces and continuous operators on it. The axioms are also shown to be consistent with the standard mathematical theory of operator algebras. The paper thus provides a mathematical foundation for quantum mechanics that is independent of any particular mathematical structure on Hilbert space."

Although the evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we compare the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insight into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Show more)"

We found that SARS-CoV-2 uses a viral accessory protein, Orf6, to block nuclear import of the cargo-receptor complex. This results in the inhibition of STAT1 and STAT2 transcriptional activity.

We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammals in semiarid African savanna. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers. Grass consumption inferred from mean sequence relative read abundance (RRA) ranged from &gt;99% (plains zebra) to &lt;1% (dik-dik). Grass RRA was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of % grass consumption, indicating that RRA conveys reliable quantitative information about consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.

We show that the plastic debris is mostly concentrated in the convergence zones of the five subtropical gyres, but the total amount of plastic on the open ocean surface is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This discrepancy is explained by the selective removal of small plastic fragments by the ocean interior. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter exhibit reduced mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals. We conclude that mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens is crucial for social behavior and point to mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens as a potential marker and avenue of treatment for anxiety-related social disorders.

The most widely used drugs for treating hypertension are the L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs). However, the use of LCCBs is associated with the development of heart failure. Here, we show that the three major classes of LCCBs activate STIM/ORAI-mediated Ca2+ entry in vascular smooth muscle cells, which promotes vascular remodeling. Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. This study may help to improve the safety of LCCBs in clinical practice. (Show more)"

In this study, we present a computational approach to design new antibiotics. The design strategy is based on the prediction of the solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity of the designed compounds. The predicted best compound was synthesized and tested in vitro and in vivo. The results show that the designed compound is more active than the current standard of care, telithromycin, and has a better safety profile.

It is broadly considered to be an anticancer target. However, current inhibitors cannot distinguish between TRAP1 and HSP90, the other major target of this family of molecular chaperones. We have shown that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This study may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment. (Show more)"

They are dynamic polymers that can be assembled and disassembled by a family of proteins. These proteins are important regulators of cell motility and shape. The proteins of this family are named actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin family, because they can cause the disassembly of actin filaments. We show that the proteins of this family can also sever actin filaments. We show that the severing of filaments is enhanced by a mechanical torque that is generated by the proteins when they bind to filaments. This mechanism is important for cells, because it allows the proteins to sever highly connected filament networks, which are found in the cytoskeleton."

The distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, there are geographic influences on the present genomic diversity, independent of the admixture, showing that a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations.

This study shows that the evolution of an aquatic lifestyle is driving three of the four extant aquatic mammal clades toward a size attractor at ∼500 kg. The existence of this body size attractor and the relatively rapid selection toward, and limited deviation from, this attractor rule out most hypothesized drivers of size increase. These three independent body size increases and a shared aquatic optimum size are consistent with control by differences in the scaling of energetic intake and cost functions with body size between the terrestrial and aquatic realms. Under this energetic model, thermoregulatory costs constrain minimum size, whereas limitations on feeding efficiency constrain maximum size. The optimum size occurs at an intermediate value where thermoregulatory costs are low but feeding efficiency remains high. Rather than being released from size pressures, water-dwelling mammals are driven and confined to larger body sizes by the strict energetic demands of the aquatic medium. (Show more)"

The temperature of the surface of the Earth is important for understanding the origin and evolution of life, as well as for the design of sustainable societies. The temperature of the Earth’s surface has been inferred from isotopic data to have decreased over geological time, but this interpretation has been subject to question due to uncertainties regarding oceanic isotopic compositions, diagenetic or metamorphic resetting of the isotopic record, and depositional environments. Here, we present thermostability measurements of ancestral enzymes derived from light-requiring prokaryotic and eukaryotic phototrophs having widely separated fossil-based divergence ages. The ancestral environmental temperatures thereby determined for these photic-zone organisms––shown in modern taxa to correlate strongly with NDK thermostability––are inferred to reflect ancient surface-environment paleotemperatures. Our results suggest that Earth’s surface temperature decreased over geological time from ∼65–80 °C in the Archean, a finding consistent both with previous isotope-based and protein reconstruction-based interpretations.

The activation and deactivation of ion channels are controlled by two gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. Our findings may help us understand the mechanism of the BK channel’s normal closing and its physiological roles. (Show more)"

In the temperate regions, seasonal influenza virus outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in ambient humidity. The impact of low humidity on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

The color of this reward is often an important factor in the success of pollination, as it is often correlated with the availability of light for pollinators. Here, we show that the red color of the nectar of the plant Nesocodon mauritianus is derived from a previously undescribed alkaloid. We also show that the same alkaloid is produced by the distantly related plant Jaltomata herrerae, which is visited by hummingbirds. This work suggests that the red color of nectar is a convergent trait that is likely to be favored by natural selection.

We present a genome-wide analysis of a group of individuals from the late 5th/early 6th century AD from present-day Bavaria, southern Germany. Our data indicate that while men generally had ancestry that closely resembles modern northern and central Europeans, women exhibit a very high genetic heterogeneity; this includes signals of genetic ancestry ranging from western Europe to East Asia. Particularly striking are women with artificial skull deformations; the analysis of their collective genetic ancestry suggests an origin in southeastern Europe. In addition, functional variants revealed that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago. This example of female-biased migration indicates that complex demographic processes during the Early Medieval period may have contributed in an unexpected way to shape the modern European genetic landscape."

The virus is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions.

One of the most important proteins involved in the replication of the lagging strand is the DNA polymerase δ (pol δ). Pol δ is responsible for synthesizing the Okazaki fragments, which are the short DNA strands synthesized during DNA replication. The stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is critical for the synthesis of Okazaki fragments. We developed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. The results indicate that human pol δ maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion.

In the laboratory, RNA molecules can be replicated by RNA polymerases, but the activity of such enzymes is limited to a few specific reactions. Here, we report the design, construction, and characterization of an RNA polymerase ribozyme that can synthesize a variety of RNA molecules, including aptamers, ribozymes, and tRNA. This polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins.

Here, we report that RORα is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis by attenuating nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcriptional activity. We also demonstrate that RORα/histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3)-mediated attenuation of NF-κB signaling controls the balance of inflammatory responses, and therapeutic strategies targeting this epigenetic regulation could be beneficial to the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our study provides insights into the role of RORα in the intestine and its potential as a therapeutic target for IBD. (Show more)"

The NVDRS summarizes violent death incidents with structured variables and unstructured narratives. We identify 225 latent topics in the narratives (e.g., preparation for death and physical aggression); many of these topics are not captured by existing structured variables.

We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML.

The protein also interferes with the ability of the RNA to repress carbon utilization genes. The RNA and protein compete for the same translation site, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

ASK1 signaling in microglia played a major role in generating and maintaining disease, and activated astrocytes produce key inflammatory mediators, including CCL2, that further activated and recruited microglia/macrophages, in an astrocytic ASK1-dependent manner. Our findings demonstrate cell-type–specific roles of ASK1 and suggest phase-specific ASK1-dependent glial cell interactions in EAE pathophysiology. We propose glial ASK1 as a promising therapeutic target for reducing neuroinflammation. (PsycINFO Database Record"

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a molecular mechanism for autism and a potential target for drug development. It also provides a general principle for understanding the function of other genes that have a similar phenotype. This principle may be applicable to other complex disorders."

These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with MERS-CoV infection into human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures, which are relevant to lung infection. The more rigid uncleaved viruses were less infectious to these cell types because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases.

This leads to activation of astrocytes, which in turn release endothelin-1 (ET-1), which causes edema.

Indeed, STING-βKO caused glucose intolerance due to impaired GSIS, indicating that STING is required for normal β-cell function. Islet transcriptome analysis showed that STING deficiency decreased expression of β-cell function–related genes, contributing to impaired GSIS. Mechanistically, the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) and cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&amp;Tag) analyses suggested that Pax6 was the transcription factor that might be associated with defective GSIS in STING-βKO mice.

Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus. This interaction is required for optimal viral replication and favors the copackaging of the interacting viral RNA segments. Our results indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions. The lack of conservation of these interactions might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses.

One of the most severe threats is the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis, which is triggered by heat stress. We show that the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis is driven by altered nutrient cycling, which is a consequence of the increased metabolic energy demand of the coral host. This shift from nutrient uptake to release by the coral host promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates, ultimately leading to the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis. Our findings provide a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

In the absence of tumors, the epithelium regulates the absorption of nutrients, mounts immune responses, and prevents systemic infections.

We show that upon loss of BMP signaling, tumors lead to aberrant activation of JNK/Mmp2 signaling, followed by intestinal barrier dysfunction and commensal imbalance. In turn, the dysbiotic microbiome triggers a regenerative response and stimulates tumor growth. We find that inhibiting JNK signaling or depletion of the microbiome restores barrier function of the intestinal epithelium, leading to a reestablishment of host–microbe homeostasis, and organismic lifespan extension.

The 5′ cap structure is thought to be produced by a single RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. We show that a second RNA polymerase also produces a 5′ cap structure on a subset of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial mRNAs. This second polymerase is not the same as the one that produces the 5′ cap structure on nuclear mRNAs. The 5′ cap structure on mitochondrial mRNAs is not the same as the 5′ cap structure on nuclear mRNAs.

These epigenetic alterations persist for several years after the end of the DCCT. These results support an epigenetic explanation for metabolic memory. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms of metabolic memory and to develop new therapeutic strategies to improve the long-term control of diabetes.

Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. (Show more)"

We show that this gene encodes a flavin-dependent monooxygenase that catalyzes sequential hydroxylations of a single precursor, 2-isobutyl-tetrahydrothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid. This work provides a major step forward in understanding the biosynthesis of nitrogenous volatiles in tomato fruit and the potential for improving their content.

This change in the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning was driven by changes in the thermal tolerance of species, which affected the diversity of species that could maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. Our results highlight the importance of considering the effects of climate change on biodiversity in the context of the entire diversity–functioning relationship. This will be critical for predicting the impacts of climate change on ecosystem functioning and services."

This study demonstrates that FTs can function as an important interplant flowering signal in host–dodder interactions. The unique means of flowering regulation of dodder illustrates how regressive evolution, commonly found in parasites, may facilitate the physiological synchronization of parasite and host, here allowing the C. australis parasite to time reproduction exactly with that of their hosts, likely optimizing parasite fitness. This study also shows that the FT gene in dodder C. australis does not function in flowering induction. This is likely due to the fact that the dodder has lost the ability to synthesize FT."

These clustered cell bodies in turn project to the striatum as part of the classic nigrostriatal pathway. Thus, these striosome–dendron bouquets likely represent subsystems with the nigro–striato–nigral loop that are affected in human disorders including Parkinson’s disease. Given evidence that striosomes receive input from cortical regions related to the control of mood and motivation and that they link functionally to reinforcement and decision-making, the striosome–dendron bouquets could be critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease."

But how do we know when two people are connected? We asked pairs of friends and strangers to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.” This is a fundamental question in social science, and our findings suggest that it may be a question with a simple answer."

The retina is also challenged by the accumulation of bisretinoids, which are products of the metabolism of the vitamin A aldehyde, retinyl palmitate. We show that the accumulation of bisretinoids in the retina is reduced in mice with reduced levels of iron, which is a cofactor for the metabolism of the vitamin A aldehyde, retinyl palmitate. These findings suggest that iron may be a factor in the metabolism of the vitamin A aldehyde, retinyl palmitate, and that iron may be a target for the development of therapies to reduce the accumulation of bisretinoids in the retina. This work also demonstrates the utility of the mouse retina as a model for the study of the metabolism of the vitamin A aldehyde, retinyl palmitate. (Read more)"

In this study, we show that the evolution of siphonophore predators has been shaped by the diversification of prey types. We also show that the evolution of specialized predators is not a dead end, and that they can evolve into generalists. These findings help us understand the evolution of specialization in predators, and how it has shaped the structure of present-day food webs."

The evolution of the human hand is a key area of research in human evolution, and the study of the earliest stages of this evolution is of particular interest. Here we report the discovery of a hominin hand fossil from East Africa that preserves the third metacarpal styloid process, a key derived feature of the human hand that is absent in early hominins. This fossil provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of this key derived feature of the human hand and suggests that it arose in the genus Homo. This finding has implications for our understanding of the evolution of the human hand and the origins of modern human-like tool use. (Show more)"

The enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) converts serine into glycine and a tetrahydrofolate-bound one-carbon unit. In mammals, there are two SHMT isozymes, one in the cytosol and one in the mitochondria. Here we show that the mitochondrial isozyme is essential for cancer cell growth, and that a small-molecule inhibitor of the enzyme blocks tumor growth in mice. We also show that cancer cells have a unique metabolic vulnerability to SHMT inhibition, which is rooted in defective glycine import. Thus, targeting SHMT may be a promising strategy for cancer treatment."

This study shows that deforestation can have a negative impact on people’s diets, which is a significant concern given that diets are a key driver of deforestation. The results have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. This study also highlights the need to consider the role of natural landscapes in strategies to improve food and nutrition security."

We show that the risk of subsoil compaction has increased over the last century, with the risk of compaction now exceeding that of the most severe cases of subsoil compaction observed in the last 5,000 y. This alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the largest sauropods had the smallest gaits, suggesting that the slow pace of sauropods may have reduced the risk of subsoil compaction. This study highlights the need to consider the ecological context of farm machinery design. (Show more)"
