The evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, and a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we compare the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. These results have important implications for understanding the origin of the Myxozoa and the evolution of parasitic lifestyles. They also have implications for understanding the evolution of the genome and the evolution of parasitism."

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to block the nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are essential for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes. Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its ability to block the nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This mechanism could be used as a target for the development of antiviral strategies. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1 channels, but the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These results suggest that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant African LMH species. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers, and grass consumption was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of % grass consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption, but dietary composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This study highlights the importance of diet composition in understanding the coexistence of LMH. It also highlights the potential of DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet composition at the species level. This approach will be critical for understanding the role of LMH in the functioning of ecosystems."

However, the magnitude of the problem is still unclear. We show that the global load of floating plastic debris is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This is due to the size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered.

A Threonine to Alanine substitution at this position was studied in three representative members of the K+-channel family. Interestingly, all of the mutant channels exhibited lack of C-type inactivation gating and an inversion of their allosteric coupling (i.e., closing of the activation gate collapses the channel’s selectivity filter).

Here we show that anxiety directly influences social dominance in male outbred rats and identify an important mediating role for mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens. High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low-anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as decreased ATP and increased ROS production in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals.

This developmental sequence is important for the proper development of the blood and the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. Here we show that the expression of the beta globin gene is reduced in human erythroid cells when the insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) is overexpressed. This results in a reduction of the beta globin protein and a concomitant increase of the gamma globin protein.

Progress on understanding ACI processes is hampered by inadequate observational capability. Here, we introduce a new instrument, the dual-field-of-view high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL), for simultaneously profiling aerosol and water cloud properties, especially water cloud microphysical properties. Continuous observations of aerosols and clouds using this instrument, verified by the Monte Carlo simulation and coincident observations of other techniques, were conducted to investigate the interactions between aerosol loading and water cloud microphysical properties. A case study over Beijing highlights the scientific potential of the HSRL to become a significant contributor to the ACI investigations. The observations obtained from the HSRL constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI process. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

We found that the BK channel, which is normally open, possesses two pore gates, one for fast activation/deactivation and the other for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. The BK channel’s C-type inactivation is state-dependent and can be closed by channel opening. We propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. Our findings provide insights into the regulation of ion channels and the mechanism of C-type inactivation. They also suggest that the BK channel may be a promising target for drug development.

The parasite, Plasmodium, uses a variety of mechanisms to invade the red blood cell (RBC) and cause disease. Here, we show that the malaria parasite uses a single protein, erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 (EBA175), to bind to glycophorin A (GPA) on the RBC surface, which alters the biophysical properties of the RBC membrane and cytoskeleton. This change in the RBC allows the parasite to invade the RBC more easily. This work suggests that the malaria parasite primes the RBC surface through its binding antigens, altering the biophysical nature of the target cell and thus reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion. This finding would constitute a major change in our concept of malaria parasite invasion, suggesting it is, in fact, a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces working together to facilitate entry. This work has important implications for the development of new antimalarial drugs. (PsycINFO Database Record"

However, the impact of humidity on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low humidity increases susceptibility to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection and may inform the development of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of influenza-associated respiratory disease.

We find that the wispy, wheel-shaped orb web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to capture the sound-induced air particle movements that approach the maximum physical efficiency better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By sensing the motion of web threads, the spider remotely detects and localizes the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave, such as those emitted by approaching prey or predators. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,00"

We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions. Our findings provide insights into the molecular basis of the cross-species transmission of MERS-CoV and other bat coronaviruses. They also suggest that"

This study demonstrates that mNGS can be used to identify the pathogens responsible for undifferentiated febrile illness in resource-scarce settings. Coordinated and ongoing mNGS pathogen surveillance can better identify the breadth of endemic, zoonotic, or emerging pathogens and deployment of rapid public health response.

Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion.

This has important implications for the climate system, as changes in fire activity can reduce warming. However, the risk is that more extreme fires will occur in the future, which could reverse this effect. Our results highlight the importance of fire in the climate system and the need to better understand the role of human activities in shaping the future of fire regimes."

However, the mechanisms by which these interactions are established and maintained are poorly understood. Here, we show that the provision of a single glycan, chitin, is sufficient to regulate the dynamics of a symbiont in a specific host–microbe interaction. This glycan is released by host immune cells in a specific manner, at a specific time of day, and is catabolized by the symbiont only at night. These findings suggest that the provision of nutrients may be a common mechanism for regulating the activities of epithelial-associated microbial communities. This study also provides a mechanism for understanding the evolution of circadian rhythms in host–microbe interactions. (PsycINFO Database Record"

We introduce a method to identify latent patterns in text data. Our method is based on advances in machine learning and word embedding. We first identify a set of vectors that can be interpreted as latent topics. We then infer the topic that generated a sequence of words. We illustrate our method with a prominent example of underutilized text: the US National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). Our results provide a detailed quantitative picture of reporting about lethal violence and its gendered nature. Our method offers a flexible and broadly applicable approach to model patterns in text data. We believe that our method will be useful to many domains, including psychology, sociology, medicine, and law.

We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. Our results suggest that behavioral inflexibility is a common consequence of autism-risk genes and that forgetting is a common mechanism.

However, the factors that contribute to virus spillover from bats are largely unknown. Here, we identified and characterized an immunosuppressant protein (MTX) that is highly concentrated in the submandibular salivary gland of the bat, Myotis pilosus. This study provides deeper insight into immunologically privileged sites for microbial community residence in bats and supports the therapeutic potential of targeting MTX-LTA4H. This study also provides a deeper understanding of the role of bats in the emergence of zoonotic viruses and the potential of bats as a source of emerging viruses.

However, the presence of proteins that are supersaturated in motor neurons, but not in other tissues, is a unique feature of ALS. This suggests that the presence of proteins that are supersaturated in motor neurons is a consequence of the disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. This, in turn, may be a consequence of the unique features of the motor neurons in ALS, such as the presence of inclusions of mutant superaggregation-prone proteins. Thus, the presence of proteins that are supersaturated in motor neurons may be a consequence of the disease process in ALS.

The band structures of the photonic crystals are predicted to produce unconventional atom–light interaction behaviors, including anisotropic emission, suppressed spontaneous decay, and photon-mediated atom–atom interactions controlled by the position of the atomic array relative to the photonic crystal. The device configuration also enables application of optical tweezers for controlled placement of atoms. Devices can be fabricated reliably from a 200-nm silicon nitride device layer using a lithography-based process, producing predicted optical properties in transmission and reflection measurements. These 2D photonic crystal devices can be readily deployed to experiments for many-body physics with neutral atoms and engineering of exotic quantum matter.

In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We found that pol II stalling at O2-EtdT and N3-EtdT sites is exacerbated by TFIIS-stimulated proofreading activity. Assessment for the impact of the EtdT lesions on individual fidelity checkpoints provided mechanistic insights, where the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion.

Although the role of STING in the regulation of insulin sensitivity has been extensively studied, its function in β-cells remains unknown. Herein, we found that STING is decreased in islets of db/db mice and patients with T2D, suggesting a possible role of STING in β-cell dysfunction. Indeed, STING deficiency in β-cells impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, indicating that STING is required for normal β-cell function. These data revealed a function of STING in the regulation of insulin secretion and established pathophysiological significance of fine-tuned STING within β-cells and insulin target tissues for maintaining glucose homeostasis. These findings may provide insights into the molecular basis of T2D. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The genome of the virus is segmented into eight fragments, which is an evolutionary advantage but complicates the packaging of the genome into the virion. Here, we identified a direct interaction between two viral RNA segments of an avian influenza virus. This interaction is required for optimal viral replication and favors the copackaging of interacting RNA segments. Our results indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions. The lack of conservation of these interactions might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses. This study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of viral genome packaging and may have implications for the development of influenza vaccines and antiviral drugs. (Show more)"

We estimate that the eclipse phase for ZIKV, the time between cell infection and viral production, is most likely short (∼4 h), the median within-host basic reproductive number R0 is 10.7, the rate of viral production is rapid (&gt;25,000 virions d−1), and the lifetime of an infected cell while producing virus is ∼5 h.

However, most studies focused on short-term warming events superimposed on longer-term greenhouse climate states. Here, we present an integrated proxy (C and uranium [U] isotopes and paleo CO2) and multicomponent modeling approach to investigate an abrupt C perturbation and global warming event (∼304 Ma) that occurred during a paleo-glacial state. We report pronounced negative C and U isotopic excursions coincident with a doubling of atmospheric CO2 partial pressure and a biodiversity nadir. The isotopic excursions can be linked to an injection of organic matter–derived C over a large area and to near 20% of areal extent of seafloor anoxia. Earth system modeling indicates that widespread anoxic conditions can be linked to enhanced thermocline stratification and increased nutrient fluxes during this global warming within an icehouse.
