Here, we present a comparative analysis of the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species and a cnidarian parasite. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Read more)"

We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1.

However, the extent to which different species partition food resources is largely unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa from DNA sequences. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammal species in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammal assemblages, and that large mammal diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results highlight the need for more comprehensive studies of diet partitioning in large mammal assemblages.

This discrepancy is explained by the selective removal of plastic debris larger than 1 mm by the ocean interior. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

The major drug class for treating hypertension is the class of drugs that block voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels (LCCBs). The three major classes of LCCBs are widely used in clinical practice. However, the mechanisms of action of these drugs are not fully understood. Here, we show that the three major classes of LCCBs activate STIM/ORAI-mediated Ca2+ entry in vascular smooth muscle cells. Our data indicate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. Our findings have implications for the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. Our data also indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in patients with heart failure, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. These findings may help to improve the safety of LCCBs in clinical practice. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

We used &gt;25 years of bird surveys to test whether the NWFP had the intended effect on biodiversity. We found that bird populations tracked changes in forest composition, but the effects of the NWFP on older-forest–associated birds were not as expected. Instead, declines of older-forest–associated birds accelerated, partly due to the loss of older forests to fire on federal land and continued clearcutting elsewhere. The NWFP has been successful in halting clearcutting on federal land, but this has so far been insufficient to reverse declines in older-forest–associated bird populations. We highlight the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure. These findings underscore the need for adaptive management and the importance of monitoring to evaluate the effects of policies on biodiversity. (Read more)"

We used a combination of phylogenomic and transcriptomic analyses to trace the evolution of beetle genes enabling symbiont-independent digestion of lignocellulose, the major component of plant cell walls, and to trace the evolution of beetle lineages. We found that plant cell wall-degrading enzymes obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, both major independent origins of specialized herbivory in beetles coincide with the first appearances of these genes in their genomes. We propose that these novel genes enabled efficient digestion of plant tissues, including lignocellulose in cell walls, facilitating the evolution of uniquely specialized plant-feeding habits, such as leaf mining and stem and wood boring. Beetle diversity thus appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding PCWDEs.

Population size was manipulated such that participants could learn from the paper planes constructed by one, two, or four models from the prior generation.

However, it is not the only factor. The number of neurons is the brain’s basic computational unit. We show that reptiles have not only small brains relative to body size but also low neuronal densities, resulting in average neuron numbers over 20 times lower than those in birds and mammals of similar body size. This has important implications for studies using relative brain size as a proxy when looking for evolutionary drivers of animal cognition."

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal cells is not well understood. Here we show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This study also provides a rationale for the development of TRAP1-directed therapies. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

This mechanism is critical to boost ADF’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells.

Here we show that the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses the mechanical activity of its surface-adhesion pili to sense surfaces and to regulate its virulence. This mechanosensory mechanism is mediated by the type IV pili, which are used for twitching motility and for sensing surfaces. The pili-mediated surface sensing results in a positive feedback that increases the activity of the pili, thereby promoting long-term surface attachment that can stimulate additional virulence and biofilm-inducing pathways. This study demonstrates that type IV pili are not only used for twitching motility, but also as a sensor that regulates surface-induced gene expression and pathogenicity. This mechanochemical model for surface sensing may be a general mechanism used by bacteria to sense their environment. Understanding the mechanisms used by bacteria to sense their environment is important for understanding the evolution of bacterial motility and virulence. This study also provides a model for the evolution of mechanosensitive signaling systems in bacteria."

This preference is due to the fact that the cap of Np4-capped RNAs is recognized by the enzyme by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5′ termini. The unique manner in which Np4-capped 5′ ends bind to the active site of the enzyme positions the δ-phosphate, rather than the β-phosphate, for hydrolytic attack, generating triphosphorylated RNA as the primary product of decapping.

In this study, we use proteomics to characterize the posttesticular life history of the Drosophila sperm proteome and determine the extent of molecular continuity between male and female reproductive tracts. We show that the male–female proteome hand-off is extensive, with multiple proteins initially associating with sperm and then being transferred to the female reproductive tract. These female-derived proteins are enriched for processes associated with energy metabolism, suggesting that female contributions support sperm viability during the prolonged period between copulation and fertilization. Our research provides a comprehensive characterization of sperm proteome dynamics and expands our understanding of the critical process of sperm–FRT interactions. This work will be of interest to the broader scientific community and the public interested in the molecular basis of sex differences. (Read more)"

Mutations in VWF cause the common bleeding disorder, von Willebrand disease (VWD). We show that force application to platelets switches the receptor glycoprotein Ibα (GPIbα) to a second state with faster on-rate, providing a mechanism for activating VWF binding to platelets. This mechanism is important for the pathophysiology of VWD. The conversion of single molecule kon (s−1) to bulk phase kon (s−1M−1) and the kon and koff values extrapolated to zero force for the low-force pathways show remarkably good agreement with bulk-phase measurements. This suggests that the force-dependent pathway is a major contributor to the observed effects of VWD mutations. These results provide a mechanism for the effects of VWD mutations on platelet binding and may be relevant to other diseases involving conformational regulation.

Here, we introduce a new instrument, the dual-field-of-view high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL), to investigate the interactions between aerosol loading and water cloud microphysical properties. The observations of aerosols and clouds using this instrument, verified by the Monte Carlo simulation and coincident observations of other techniques, were conducted to investigate the interactions between aerosol loading and water cloud microphysical properties. A case study over Beijing highlights the scientific potential of the dual-FOV HSRL to become a significant contributor to the ACI investigations.

The temperature of Earth’s surface is inferred to have decreased over geological time, a finding that is consistent with both geologic and protein reconstruction-based interpretations. However, the geologic record is subject to question due to uncertainties regarding oceanic isotopic compositions, diagenetic or metamorphic resetting of the isotopic record, and depositional environments. The thermostability of reconstructed ancestral enzymes provides an independent method by which to assess the temperature history inferred from the isotopic evidence. Our results suggest that Earth’s surface temperature decreased over geological time from ∼65–80 °C in the Archean, a finding consistent both with previous isotope-based and protein reconstruction-based interpretations.

They are also the main targets of drugs. Ion channels are open or closed, and the open probability is regulated by the channel’s internal and external signals. The open probability is also regulated by the channel’s conformational changes, which are controlled by the channel’s pore gates. Ion channels have two types of pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation.

However, whether and how the brain builds such structures remains largely unknown. Here, we used intracranial recordings to investigate how left-hemispheric brain activity varies during the formation of phrase structures. We found that each additional word or multiword phrase contributed a similar amount of additional brain activity, providing evidence for a merge operation that applies equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity. More superficial models of language, based solely on sequential transition probability over lexical and syntactic categories, only captured activity in the posterior middle temporal gyrus. Formal model comparison indicated that the model of multiword phrase construction provided a better fit than probability-based models at most sites in superior temporal and inferior frontal cortices. Activity in those regions was consistent with a neural implementation of a bottom-up or left-corner parser of the incoming language stream.

We investigated the effects of soil management on SOC storage and the distribution of SOC between particulate and mineral-associated fractions in a 29-y-old field experiment in the North Central United States. We found that soil management practices that minimized soil disturbance, diversified crop rotations, and added manure to annual cropping systems increased SOC storage and the distribution of SOC between particulate and mineral-associated fractions. These results highlight the importance of well-managed grasslands in climate-smart agriculture. Our findings have implications for the global carbon cycle and the ability of agricultural systems to mitigate climate change. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

We used expert opinion and scientific evidence to identify host, viral, and environmental risk factors contributing to zoonotic virus spillover and spread in humans. We then developed a risk ranking framework and interactive web tool, SpillOver, that estimates a risk score for wildlife-origin viruses, creating a comparative risk assessment of viruses with uncharacterized zoonotic spillover potential alongside those already known to be zoonotic. Using data from a virus discovery project, we validated the risk assessment and ranked the spillover potential of 887 wildlife viruses. SpillOver is a living, interactive database that can be refined over time to continue to improve the quality and public availability of information on viral threats to human health. We hope that SpillOver will be used by policy makers and health scientists to inform research and public health interventions for prevention and rapid control of disease outbreaks."

The color of nectar is often used as a proxy for the color of the reward, but the mechanisms that underlie this color change are poorly understood. Here, we show that the color of the nectar of the plant Nesocodon mauritianus is derived from a previously undescribed alkaloid. We identify three enzymes that are necessary or sufficient for the production of the red pigment, which is likely to be a key component of the plant’s pollination strategy. We also identify the red nectar of the hummingbird-visited Jaltomata herrerae as a convergent adaptation to vertebrate pollination. This work provides insight into the evolution of a key trait in the plant–pollinator interaction. It also suggests that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation. This work may have implications for the evolution of vertebrate pollination in other plant lineages. (Read more)"

Here we present a genome-wide analysis of a panel of 41 individuals from Bavaria, Germany, dating mostly to the late 5th/early 6th century AD. We find that the genetic ancestry of men is mostly consistent with modern northern and central Europeans, but that women exhibit a very high genetic heterogeneity, including signals of genetic ancestry ranging from western Europe to East Asia. In addition, we found that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago. These results indicate that complex demographic processes during the Early Medieval period may have contributed in an unexpected way to shape the modern European genetic landscape.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions. Our findings have implications for the development of vaccines and therapeutics against bat coronaviruses. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is integral to every aspect of replication. We developed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. Surprisingly, the results indicate that human pol δ maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This work provides a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme and its role in DNA replication.

The age model for the extinction is critical for understanding the causes and consequences of the event. We present a new age model for the extinction based on U-Pb dating of volcanic ash beds. The age model is based on five ash beds, each of which is interpreted as a deposition of a major volcanic eruption. The age model is consistent with the onset of a major reorganization of the carbon cycle immediately preceding the initiation of extinction. The carbon cycle volatility persists for ∼500 ka before a return to near preextinction values. The new age model will allow a refined evaluation of the relative roles of rate-dependent processes contributing to the extinction, allowing insight into postextinction ecosystem expansion. The age model will also be used to evaluate the plausibility of trigger and kill mechanisms. (Read more)"

In this study, we show that the squid provides a single glycan to its symbiont, which is required for the persistence of the symbiont in the symbiotic organ. This glycan is delivered only at night, when the squid is not active, and is metabolized by the symbiont to enhance the pH of the organ. This, in turn, increases the availability of oxygen to the symbiont, which is required for its bioluminescence. We propose that this is a general strategy for regulating the activities of symbionts in their host’s epithelium. This mechanism may be used by other hosts to control the activities of their symbionts. (Read more)"

This pandemic is generally understood as the consequence of a singular introduction of Yersinia pestis, after which the disease established itself in European rodents over four centuries. To locate these putative plague reservoirs, we studied the climate fluctuations that preceded regional plague epidemics, based on a dataset of 7,711 georeferenced historical plague outbreaks and 15 annually resolved tree-ring records from Europe and Asia. We provide evidence for repeated climate-driven reintroductions of the bacterium into European harbors from reservoirs in Asia, with a delay of 15 ± 1 y.

We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The RNA encodes a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC) that increases the activity of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. We found that overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that the RNA base pairs with the cadA and galE genes, and that translation of the RNA interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA.

In this study, we generated conditional knockout (CKO) mice that lack ASK1 in microglia/macrophages, astrocytes, or both. We found that ASK1 in microglia/macrophages plays a major role in generating and maintaining disease, whereas ASK1 in astrocytes plays a greater proinflammatory role in the later stage.

Therefore, it is challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. Our study provides a molecular mechanism for autism-risk genes and a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

To better understand how sequential proteolysis contributes to infection, we introduced mutations that blocked the first cleavages of the spike (S) glycoproteins. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses trafficked past cell-surface proteases and into endosomes, whereas precleaved viruses used endosomal proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry. Uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence.

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive design-based analysis of the effect of universal vote-by-mail—a policy under which every voter is mailed a ballot in advance of the election—on electoral outcomes. We find that universal vote-by-mail does not appear to affect either party’s share of turnout, does not appear to increase either party’s vote share, and modestly increases overall average turnout rates, in line with previous estimates.

We demonstrated that this interaction takes place in infected cells and is required for optimal viral replication. This interaction is sequence specific and favors copackaging of the interacting viral RNA segments. Our results indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions. The lack of conservation of these interactions might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses.

It is essential for the maintenance of genetic diversity in sexually reproducing organisms. In this study, we describe the distribution of recombination across the genome of a flowering plant, Mimulus guttatus. We find that recombination is concentrated in hotspots, interspersed with cold regions. The hotspots are more concentrated in promoters of genes than in other regions of the genome. The distribution of hotspots is similar to that observed in yeast and in mice, suggesting that the mechanisms that generate hotspots in these organisms may have been conserved in the evolution of flowering plants."

The analysis of these fluctuations has led to the identification of a number of topographies, or networks, that are significantly different from one another. Here, we used metabolic PET to identify and validate reproducible RSN topographies in healthy and disease populations. In healthy subjects, the dominant (first component) metabolic RSN was topographically similar to the default mode network (DMN). In contrast, in Parkinson’s disease (PD), this RSN was subordinated to an independent disease-related pattern. Network functionality was assessed by quantifying metabolic RSN expression in cerebral blood flow PET scans acquired at rest and during task performance. The dominant RSN was deactivated during rest in healthy subjects and early Parkinson’s disease, and partially corrected by dopaminergic therapy. In contrast, the subordinate RSNs were activated during task performance in healthy subjects and advanced Parkinson’s disease. These results illustrate the potential of metabolic imaging to provide useful information regarding the resting organization of the brain in health and disease."

The role of a recently identified cancer antigen, fibrous sheath interacting protein 1 (FSIP1), in TNBC has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. This article is protected by copyright.

These results suggest the existence of a gut–brain axis in alcohol dependence, which implicates the gut microbiota as an actor in the gut barrier and in behavioral disorders.

But how do we know when two people are connected? We asked pairs of friends and strangers to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

In species with polygenic sex determination, multiple alleles interact to produce the sex of an individual. In this study, we investigate the effects of polygenic sex determination on secondary sexual characteristics in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii. We find that the interaction of multiple sex determination alleles produces a modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics, including genital morphology, craniofacial morphology, gastrointestinal morphology, and home tank behaviors. The modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics produced by polygenic sex determination provides context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations. This study also provides a case study of the evolution of secondary sexual characteristics in a species with a modular system of sexual polymorphism."

We sought to understand how Fe levels impact the retina, given that retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are also challenged by accumulations of bisretinoids. We found that intracellular Fe promotes bisretinoid oxidation and degradation. This interpretation was supported by experiments showing that Fe chelation decreased the oxidative/degradation of the bisretinoid A2E in the presence of light and reduced cell death in cell-based experiments. Moreover, light-independent oxidation and degradation of A2E by Fenton chemistry products were evidenced by the consumption of A2E, release of dicarbonyls, and generation of oxidized A2E species in cell-free assays. These findings indicate that Fe is a key factor in the photodegradation of bisretinoids. Understanding the role of Fe in the photodegradation of bisretinoids may lead to the development of new strategies for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration. (Read more)"

In this study, we show that the evolution of siphonophore tentilla (tentacle side branches armed with nematocysts) has been linked to the evolution of prey type. We also show that the evolution of prey specialization is not a dead end, and that prey specialization can evolve into prey generalization. These findings help us understand how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs. They also contribute to the broader perspective of predatory niche diversification via morphological innovation and evolution."

The study of the hominin hand is complicated by the paucity of hand fossils in the hominin fossil record between 800,000 and 1.8 My old, a time interval well documented for the emergence and subsequent proliferation of Acheulian technology. We report the discovery of a hominin hand fossil from the Middle Pleistocene to recent East African hominin site of Kaitio, West Turkana, Kenya, that provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key derived feature of the modern human hand. This finding suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato. This study also highlights the importance of the fossil record in understanding the evolution of the hominin hand. (Read more)"

Here we show that the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) is a metabolic vulnerability of cancer cells. We identify a small-molecule inhibitor of SHMT, and show that it blocks colon cancer tumor growth in mice. We also show that SHMT inhibition is particularly effective in B-cell lines, and that this effect is rooted in defective glycine import. Thus, we have identified a metabolic vulnerability of cancer cells that can be exploited to treat cancer. This work provides a foundation for the development of small-molecule inhibitors of SHMT, and for the development of a metabolic vulnerability-based strategy to treat cancer.

This study shows that deforestation can reduce people’s consumption of fruits and vegetables and thus their vitamin A intake. Conversely, forest fragmentation can increase people’s consumption of fruits and vegetables and thus their vitamin A intake. These findings have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. This study also highlights the importance of using a causal modeling approach to understand the effects of deforestation on people’s diets. This approach allows for causal inferences to be made, which is not possible using traditional descriptive approaches. We believe that this study will be of interest to researchers and policy makers interested in the role of natural landscapes in improving people’s diets."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We hypothesize that this trend calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction."
