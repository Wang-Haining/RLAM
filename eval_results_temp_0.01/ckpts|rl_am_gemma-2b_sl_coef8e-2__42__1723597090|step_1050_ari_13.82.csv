Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we compare the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results show that myxozoans are cnidarians and are a sister taxon to P. hydriforme. In addition, our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. These results have important implications for understanding the origin of parasitism. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to block the nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are essential for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We found that the SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein Orf6 is responsible for this activity. We also show that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1, a protein complex involved in nuclear import. Our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a molecular understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 is able to evade the host immune response and highlights the importance of Nup98-Rae1 in antiviral defense.

We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

The NWFP also created early-seral ecosystems, but these have not been developed in a way that supports the development of older-forest structure. We conclude that the NWFP needs to be strengthened to halt the decline of older-forest–associated bird populations. We also show that the NWFP has been effective in halting the decline of early-seral–associated bird populations. This suggests that the early-seral ecosystem created under the NWFP is a valuable addition to the conservation of early-seral birds. However, the NWFP needs to be strengthened to ensure that the early-seral ecosystem does not impede the development of older-forest structure."

Here we present evidence that the Hellenistic (fourth–second centuries B.C.E.) site of Maresha, Israel, is the earliest site known today where economic exploitation of chickens was widely practiced. We base our claim on the exceptionally high frequency of chicken bones at that site, the majority of which belong to adult individuals, and on the observed 2:1 ratio of female to male bones. These results are supported further by an extensive survey of faunal remains from 234 sites in the Southern Levant, spanning more than three millennia, which shows a sharp increase in the frequency of chicken during the Hellenistic period. We further argue that the earliest secure evidence for economic exploitation of chickens in Europe dates to the first century B.C.E. and therefore is predated by the finds in the Southern Levant by at least a century.

However, the ACI is difficult to be well represented in current climate models. The main reason is that the ACI is complex and difficult to be observed. Here, we introduce a new technique, the dual-field-of-view high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL), to observe simultaneously aerosol and cloud properties. The HSRL is expected to be a significant step forward in characterizing ACI. The observations obtained from the HSRL constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI process.

The most widely accepted estimate of surface temperature in the Archean, the earliest geologic period of Earth, is 70 ± 15 °C. This estimate is based on isotopic evidence, however, and has been subject to question due to uncertainties regarding the isotopic record, diagenetic or metamorphic resetting of the isotopic record, and depositional environments. Here, we present thermostability measurements of ancestral enzymes derived from light-requiring prokaryotic and eukaryotic phototrophs having widely separated fossil-based divergence ages. The ancestral environmental temperatures thereby determined for these photic-zone organisms––shown in modern taxa to correlate strongly with thermostability––are inferred to reflect ancient surface-environment paleotemperatures. Our results suggest that Earth’s surface temperature decreased over geological time from ∼65–80 °C in the Archean, a finding consistent both with previous isotope-based and protein reconstruction-based interpretations. Interdisciplinary studies such as those reported here integrating genomic, geologic, and paleontologic data hold promise for providing new insight into the coevolution of life and environment over Earth history.

The activation gate is the main site of regulation for fast channel opening and closing. The C-type inactivation gate is the main site of regulation for slow C-inactivation/recovery. We found that the BK channel lacks an intracellular activation gate and instead has a C-type inactivation gate at the selectivity filter. We also found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is state-dependent and that its rates and extents inversely correlate with channel-open probability. We propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. This study provides a new perspective on the regulation of ion channels.

We found that the risk of undifferentiated febrile illness was associated with age, sex, and the presence of HIV. Our findings highlight the potential of mNGS to detect undifferentiated febrile illness and its associated pathogens in resource-scarce settings. Ongoing pathogen surveillance using mNGS can better identify the breadth of endemic, zoonotic, or emerging pathogens and deployment of rapid public health response.

This process is essential for the survival of the cell and is therefore tightly regulated. In this study, we developed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. We found that pol δ maintains a loose association with the PCNA sliding clamp while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This study provides a unique perspective on the regulation of strand exchange in humans. It also provides a foundation for the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of human diseases. This study is expected to be a milestone in the field of DNA replication."

In this paper, we describe the first in vitro evolution of an RNA polymerase ribozyme, which can synthesize a variety of RNA molecules, including aptamers, ribozymes, and tRNA. The polymerase can also replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins.

Our study highlights that ignitions and active and passive fire suppression can be as important in driving future fire regimes as changes in climate, although with some risk of more extreme fires regionally. This has implications for other ecosystem functions in fire-dependent ecosystems."

Here, we show that the squid Euprymna scolopes regulates the activities of its luminescent symbiont, Vibrio fischeri, by the strategic delivery of a single glycan, chitin. This glycan is catabolized by the symbiont only at night, when the squid is producing light, and is required for the periodic acidification of the crypts, which is essential for the maintenance of the symbiosis. This glycan delivery strategy may be used by other animal hosts to regulate the activities of their associated microbes. (Show more)"

We demonstrate that monoclonal antibodies targeting IL1RAP have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We also show that an antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling is effective in suppressing the proliferation of primary human AML cells. These results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. Furthermore, the results suggest that IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells. Thus, inhibition of IL-1 signaling may be a promising strategy for the treatment of AML.

Our findings suggest that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner. During the functional reduction process, the elevation of evolutionary rates reaches several new rate equilibria, possibly relating to the modified protein turnover rates in heterotrophic plastids.

We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting.

The enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) is a key metabolic node for one-carbon unit supply. Here we report the discovery of a small-molecule inhibitor of SHMT, which we use to identify a metabolic dependency of colon cancer cells. We then show that the one-carbon donor formate can rescue cells from SHMT inhibition, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We also show that defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. These findings provide a metabolic rationale for targeting SHMT in cancer, and a metabolic vulnerability in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

Rather, we show that the presence of coaggregating proteins in ALS is due to the fact that the proteins are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

This glycan is catabolized by the symbionts, which is required for the maintenance of a normal symbiont population level. Finally, the catabolism of this glycan is also required for the periodic acidification of the squid’s symbiotic crypts, which increases the availability of oxygen to the symbionts and enhances their luminescence.

The economic and ecological costs of wildfire in the United States have risen substantially in recent decades. Although climate change has likely enabled a portion of the increase in wildfire activity, the direct role of people in increasing wildfire activity has been largely overlooked. We show that humans have vastly expanded the spatial and seasonal “fire niche” in the United States, accounting for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. Human-caused wildfires disproportionally occurred where fuel moisture was higher than lightning-caused fires, thereby helping expand the geographic and seasonal niche of wildfire. Actions to raise awareness and increase management in regions prone to human-started wildfires should be a focus of United States policy to reduce fire risk and associated hazards. (Abridged)"

Neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities."

However, the effect of certification on deforestation in oil palm plantations remains unclear. Here, we show that certification is associated with reduced deforestation in Indonesia, the leading producer of palm oil. Nevertheless, most plantations contained little residual forest when they received certification. As a result, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation.
