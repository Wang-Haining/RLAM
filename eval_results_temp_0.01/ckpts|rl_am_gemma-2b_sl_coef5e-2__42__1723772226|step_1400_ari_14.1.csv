Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we present the first genomic and transcriptomic analyses of two myxozoans, Kudoa iwatai and Myxobolus cerebralis, and compare these to the transcriptome and genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results show that myxozoans are cnidarians and are a sister taxon to P. hydriforme. They also suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. These results have implications for understanding the origin of parasitic lifestyles. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that the SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein Orf6 is able to block the nuclear import of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are essential for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We found that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and interacts with the Nup98-Rae1 complex, which is involved in the nuclear import of ISGs. We also show that a simple mutation in Orf6 abolishes its ability to block nuclear import of STAT1 and STAT2. These results unveil a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1, but the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv"

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species in semiarid African savanna. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers, and grass consumption was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption, but dietary composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized."

We show that the policy had little effect on the conservation of older-forest–associated birds, but did reduce the decline of early-seral–associated birds. However, the policy failed to halt the decline of older forests, and the early-seral ecosystem area declined in two ecoregions. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure."

This problem can be addressed by the development of new antibacterial agents to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. In this study, we present a rational design approach to identify new acylide antibiotics. The design strategy is based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess the performance of the design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

The network architecture is based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales, and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters. The proposed architecture is also easier to implement, train, and apply in practice. The proposed architecture can be used in many image-processing problems.

We used a grid-based approach to sample the genomic diversity across Madagascar, from the north to the south, from the east to the west. We find that the Malagasy population is a mixture of Bantu and Austronesian populations, with a limited contribution from Europe and the Middle East. The distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. These results provide insights into the settlement history of Madagascar and the genetic consequences of the island’s isolation.

However, the complexity of ACI makes it difficult to be well represented in current climate models. This is due to the lack of observational capability to measure the aerosol–cloud interaction processes. Here, we introduce a new instrument, the dual-field-of-view high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL), which can measure aerosol and cloud properties simultaneously. This instrument is used to investigate the aerosol–cloud interaction processes. The results show that the aerosol loading has no discernible effect on the liquid water path, but does increase the number of cloud droplets and decrease the droplet effective radius. This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI."

This study provides a new method for determining the temperature of the early Earth, based on the thermostability of reconstructed ancestral enzymes. The results suggest that the temperature of the early Earth decreased over time. This is consistent with other methods of determining the temperature of the early Earth, and provides a new perspective on the evolution of life on Earth."

The activation and inactivation of ion channels are important for the control of cell excitability and the regulation of ion homeostasis. The K+ channel, the BK channel, is a large-conductance, voltage-gated potassium channel that is involved in a variety of physiological processes. The BK channel is unique in that it does not have an intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally shows no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s activation and inactivation are state-dependent and that its C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent. These findings provide insights into the regulation of ion channels and the control of ion homeostasis. (Show more)"

The stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. In this study, we developed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. We found that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This study provides a unique perspective on the structure and function of the pol δ holoenzyme and its role in lagging strand replication. It also provides a unique perspective on the structure and function of the pol δ holoenzyme and its role in lagging strand replication. (Show more)"

We connect changes in the physical appearance of five US cities with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities."

We also show that the catabolism of this glycan is required for the maintenance of the symbiosis, and that this catabolism is restricted to a specific time of the day. These results suggest that the provision of nutrients at specific times of the day may be a general strategy used by animals to control the composition of their microbiota. This control may be exerted by the catabolism of specific glycans, which in turn modulates the conditions in the habitat of the symbionts."

We illustrate our method with a prominent example of underutilized text: the US National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). We identify 225 latent topics in the narratives of violent deaths (e.g., preparation for death and physical aggression). We then compare the gender bias of topics to their prevalence in narratives of female versus male victims. Our method offers a flexible and broadly applicable approach to model topics in text data. It can be applied to many domains, and it can be extended to other types of data. It can also be used to identify latent patterns in text data from many domains."

The disease is caused by mutations in a number of genes, including those that encode for proteins that are involved in the metabolism of iron, copper, and zinc. These proteins are highly aggregation-prone and form intracellular inclusions that are characteristic of different neuropathological subtypes of the disease. Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions in the brain and spinal cord are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. Rather, the inclusions are populated by proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, but become supersaturated upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. This metastable state may be a common feature of neurodegenerative diseases."

We found that the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion.

The economic and ecological costs of wildfire have risen substantially in recent decades, and climate change has likely contributed to the increase in wildfire activity. However, the direct role of people in increasing wildfire activity has been largely overlooked. We show that humans have vastly expanded the spatial and seasonal “fire niche” in the United States, accounting for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. Our results highlight the need for policies to reduce fire risk and associated hazards."

In this paper, we introduce a computer vision method to measure changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods from time-series street-level imagery. We connect changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods with economic and demographic data and find that three factors predict neighborhood improvement: the density of college-educated adults, the initial appearance of the neighborhood, and the proximity of the neighborhood to other attractive neighborhoods. Our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities."

Here, we show that the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis is driven by altered nutrient cycling during heat stress. This shift from nutrient uptake to release by the coral host promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates, leading to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host. This process is a key factor in the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis and may help explain the stability of the coral holobiont in light of its metabolic interactions.

Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection.

It is composed of specialized cardiomyocytes, the sinoatrial (SAN) cells, which are responsible for generating the electrical impulse that drives the heart. The SAN is a highly coordinated system, and the precise timing of the electrical impulse is critical for the heart to beat at the proper rate. This study shows that the calcium store of the SAN cells is important for the proper timing of the electrical impulse. This work provides insight into the mechanisms that control the timing of the electrical impulse in the heart. (Show more)"

These results suggest that Si and JA interact in the defense response against insect herbivores. This study provides insights into the role of Si in plant defense and may lead to the development of Si-based strategies for insect pest control. (Show more)"

However, most studies have focused on large watersheds, and the role of small tributaries has been largely overlooked. We show that small tributaries can be a major source of nutrients to the nearshore zone of large lakes. We found that the 6 largest tributaries of Lake Michigan accounted for 70% of the daily nutrient loads delivered to the lake. However, small tributaries were responsible for 80% of the daily nutrient loads that were dissolved inorganic and available for uptake by algae. This finding suggests that small tributaries may be a major source of coastal algal blooms. Our results highlight the importance of small tributaries in driving coastal eutrophication and provide a framework for understanding the relative importance of different watershed sizes in driving coastal nutrient inputs. This information is critical for developing effective nutrient management strategies to protect coastal ecosystems."

This behavior is reminiscent of the “saddle-node” bifurcation, which is a well-known phenomenon in dynamical systems theory. We also find that the dynamics of the system are sensitive to the details of the environment, and that the system can exhibit a variety of different behaviors depending on the details of the environment.
