In this paper, we provide a purely categorical approach to the foundations of quantum theory. The approach is based on a set of axioms that are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. The axioms are designed to guarantee that the category of Hilbert spaces and bounded linear operators is equivalent to the category of sets and functions whose underlying sets are compact Hausdorff spaces and whose functions are continuous. This approach provides a framework for the study of quantum theory that is independent of any particular mathematical structure, such as vector spaces or Hilbert spaces."

Our results show that myxozoans are cnidarians and that the transition from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic cnidarian is accompanied by a dramatic reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insight into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer.

Popular network architectures often add additional operations and connections to the standard architecture to enable training deeper networks. To achieve accurate results in practice, a large number of trainable parameters are often required. Here, we introduce a network architecture based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data.

We present a continuous, first-of-its-kind 1.3-My record of continental hydroclimate and lake-level variability. The record shows dramatic shifts in effective moisture, resulting in large-scale changes in one of the world’s largest lakes and most diverse freshwater ecosystems. The record also reveals a dramatic shift in the hydroclimate at the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, consistent with far-field climate forcing, which separates vastly different hydroclimate regimes before and after 800,000 years ago. The record also shows that the climate was drier than today before 800 ka, and that water levels changed frequently. Following the MPT, high-amplitude lake level variations dominate the record, and from 800 to 100 ka, a deep, often overfilled lake occupied the basin, indicating a wetter climate. These highstands were interrupted by prolonged intervals of extreme drought. The extreme hydroclimate variability exerted a profound influence on the Lake Malawi endemic cichlid fish species flock; the geographically extensive habitat reconfiguration provided novel ecological"

Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to study the action of ADF in different mechanical situations. We find that local curvature favors severing, while tension surprisingly has no effect on ADF binding and weakly enhances severing. Remarkably, we observe that filament segments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist, experience a mechanical torque upon cofilin binding. We find that this ADF-induced torque increases the severing rate constant 100-fold. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells.

Our results suggest that emotional contagion is possible in the real world, and that in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction is not necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others’ positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people."

However, there are many instances where the ribosome encounters a codon that is not translated, but instead undergoes a chemical modification. In this work, we show that the presence of one of the most common modifications, pseudouridine (Ψ), can modestly alter the rate of protein synthesis. Our findings suggest that the presence of Ψ in an mRNA can lead to the synthesis of multiple peptide products from a single mRNA sequence, and that the ribosome can encounter Ψ in a manner that can alter both translation speed and mRNA decoding. These findings have implications for understanding the function of Ψ in cells and may also be relevant to the development of mRNA-based therapeutics. (Show more)"

This instrument is capable of providing high-resolution and simultaneous observations of aerosols and clouds, especially water cloud microphysical properties. We demonstrate the scientific potential of this instrument by conducting a case study over Beijing. The observations show that the increased aerosol loading led to increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius, which is consistent with expectations. However, the increased droplet number concentration was canceled out by enhanced evaporation, so the liquid water path was not increased. This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations obtained from the dual-FOV HSRL constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI.

In the temperate regions, seasonal influenza virus outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in humidity. While low ambient humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings may help to develop strategies to reduce the impact of influenza virus infection in the temperate regions. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Here, we show that high-gamma power in multiple regions of the brain increases with each successive word in a sentence but decreases suddenly whenever words can be merged into a phrase. This merge operation is consistent with a left-corner parser of the incoming language stream. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases. This may be a fundamental property of the language system."

It is important for development and disease. Axin is a key component of the pathway. We show that the two forms of Axin are similar at the protein level and genetically redundant. We also show that the two forms of Axin are regulated differently at the transcriptional and proteostatic level. This differential regulation confers differential responsiveness that can be used in tissue-specific regulation. Such subtle features may distinguish other redundant gene pairs that are commonly found in vertebrates through gene knockout experiments. This work may help to understand the evolution of redundant genes in vertebrates.

It is present in all animals, including all mammals, birds, some reptiles, amphibians, fish, and arthropods. However, the diversity of the auditory organs of these animals is astonishing, and they are all made up of cellular tissue and are morphologically part of the body of the animal. Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is outsourced to its proteinaceous, self-manufactured web. The spider’s web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to sense the motion of web threads, which allows the spider to remotely detect and localize the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself. The outsourcing and supersizing of auditory function in spiders provides unique features for studying extended and regenerative sensing and designing novel acoustic flow detectors for precise fluid dynamic measurement and manipulation.

These findings suggest that the xan BGC is involved in the control of copper levels and the regulation of interactions with competing microbes. This is an important discovery, as it suggests that the existence of the xan BGC in several filamentous fungi suggests a heretofore unknown role of eukaryotic natural products in copper homeostasis and mediation of interactions with competing microbes. This work may also have implications for the treatment of fungal infections. (Show more)"

We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA.

This approach can be extended to other crops and countries, and can be used to monitor crop status and detect anomalies in real time. This is a key step towards the development of a global network of “people as sensors” that can provide continuous and accurate information on crop status."

We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. We show that sequential proteolysis is a determinant of MERS-CoV infection. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas the more rigid uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into endosomes. Uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence.

However, this attribution is based on a single paleoclimate proxy, and the timing of the change is uncertain. Here, we show that a series of massive volcanic eruptions at the start of Southern Hemisphere deglaciation is consistent with a poleward shift in the westerlies and a reduction in Southern Hemisphere precipitation, and that the eruptions led to stratospheric ozone depletion, which is known to reduce the strength of the westerlies. This suggests that the Mount Takahe eruptions may have led to a poleward shift in the westerlies and a reduction in Southern Hemisphere precipitation, which in turn may have led to the collapse of the Southern Hemisphere summer monsoons. This is a unique link between volcanism and climate that has not been considered before."

Here, we present a study of an abrupt climate change event that occurred during a glacial period. We show that the event was linked to a global warming and that the warming was driven by an increase in atmospheric CO2. We also show that the event was linked to an increase in nutrient fluxes and to an increase in the stratification of the ocean. These results provide insights into the Earth system response to abrupt climate change."

We show that certification has reduced deforestation in Indonesia, but that most certified areas still contain substantial amounts of forest. We also show that certification has no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Our results suggest that certification is not yet having the desired impact on deforestation, and that broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results also suggest that certification may be a useful tool for reducing fire, but that more research is needed to understand the causal impact of certification on fire. Our results are important for the future of certification as a tool for reducing tropical deforestation."

In humans, its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. In this study, we discovered a small molecule that inhibits the exocyst complex and can be used to study its function in plants and humans. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and a potential drug target for human disease. (Show more)"

In many species, sex is determined by a single gene, but in others, sex is determined by multiple interacting genes. Here we show that the multiple sex determination alleles in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii interact to produce a modular system of sex-linked traits. This system of modular traits provides context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations."

We show that the intracellular levels of iron, which is a key ROS source, impact the generation of ROS and the photodegradation of lipofuscin, a major source of oxidative damage in the retina. These findings have implications for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration, which is characterized by accumulation of lipofuscin. Our results suggest that the intracellular levels of iron may be a therapeutic target for this disease. (Less)"

We show that the increase in mechanization has led to a significant increase in subsoil compaction, which is now a major threat to soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map of subsoil compaction susceptibility, which shows that 20% of arable land is at risk of chronic subsoil compaction. This alarming trend calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the discovery of a 130-million-year-old footprint in the Morrison Formation of North America. This footprint is the oldest evidence of subsoil compaction and may have been caused by the sauropod’s weight."
