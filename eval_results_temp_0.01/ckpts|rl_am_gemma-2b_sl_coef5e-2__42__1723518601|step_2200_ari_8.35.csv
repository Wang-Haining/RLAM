It shows that the global fleet has doubled in size since 1950, with the motorized fleet increasing by a factor of 10. The effective CPUE of most countries has decreased by a fifth since the 1950s, indicating that the global fisheries are being overexploited. The paper also shows that the global fleet is stabilizing, with a reduction in fleet sizes in developed countries. However, the rate of expansion is still high, and the global fleet could increase by a further million vessels by midcentury as developing countries continue to transition away from subsistence fisheries. This would have a significant impact on the sustainability of the global fisheries."

This problem can be addressed by the development of new antibacterial agents to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. In this work, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

The architecture is based on a simple idea of using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data. The proposed architecture is easy to implement, train, and apply in practice, and can be used in a wide range of problems."

However, the ACI is complex and difficult to be well represented in current climate models. Progress on understanding ACI processes is hampered by inadequate observational capability. Here, we introduce a new technique, the dual-field-of-view high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL), to investigate the ACI. The HSRL is capable of simultaneously profiling aerosol and cloud properties, especially cloud microphysical properties. A case study over Beijing demonstrates the scientific potential of the HSRL to become a significant contributor to the ACI investigations. The observations obtained from the HSRL constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI process. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI. Thus, the HSRL is expected to be a significant contribution to the understanding of ACI. (Abridged)"

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, in the days (Studies 1 and 2) and months (Studies 3 through 6) following the 2016 American presidential election, women’s and men’s endorsement of hegemonic masculinity predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. The findings highlight the importance of psychological examinations of masculinity as a cultural ideology to understand how men’s and women’s endorsement of hegemonic masculinity legitimizes patriarchal dominance and reinforces gender, race, and class-based hierarchies via candidate support.

We connect changes in the physical appearance of five US cities with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities."

The age model for this event is critical for understanding the causes and consequences of the extinction and recovery dynamics. We present a new age model for the extinction based on U-Pb dating of volcanic ash beds. The age model is based on five ash beds, each of which is interpreted as a deposition of a volcanic ash cloud. The age model is consistent with the timing of the extinction and the onset of a major reorganization of the carbon cycle. The carbon cycle volatility persists for ∼500 ka before a return to near preextinction values. This work provides a new time point for evaluating the plausibility of trigger and kill mechanisms. The age model will also be critical for evaluating the timing of recovery of the ecosystem. (Less)"

The Black and Latino populations are estimated to experience declines in life expectancy at birth of 2.10 and 3.05 y, respectively, both of which are several times the 0.68-y reduction for Whites. Latinos, who have consistently experienced lower mortality than Whites, would see their more than 3-y survival advantage reduced to less than 1 y.

We provide evidence for repeated climate-driven reintroductions of the bacterium into European harbors from reservoirs in Asia, with a delay of 15 ± 1 y. Our analysis finds no support for the existence of permanent plague reservoirs in medieval Europe. This suggests that the introduction of the disease into Europe was not a single event, but rather a series of introductions, which may have been delayed by several years.

Our analysis reveals no significant differences in the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration between control and warmed plots in all biomes, with the exception of deserts and boreal forests.

The band structures of the 2D photonic crystals are predicted to produce unconventional atom–light interaction behaviors, including anisotropic emission, suppressed spontaneous decay, and photon-mediated atom–atom interactions controlled by the position of the atomic array relative to the photonic crystal. The device configuration also enables application of optical tweezers for controlled placement of atoms. Devices can be fabricated reliably from a 200-nm silicon nitride device layer using a lithography-based process, producing predicted optical properties in transmission and reflection measurements. These 2D photonic crystal devices can be readily deployed to experiments for many-body physics with neutral atoms and engineering of exotic quantum matter. This work is expected to be of interest to researchers in many-body physics, atomic physics, and photonics."

In the United States, the economic and ecological costs of wildfire have risen substantially in recent decades. Although climate change has likely enabled a portion of the increase in wildfire activity, the direct role of people in increasing wildfire activity has been largely overlooked. We show that humans have vastly expanded the spatial and seasonal “fire niche” in the United States, accounting for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. Actions to raise awareness and increase management in regions prone to human-started wildfires should be a focus of United States policy to reduce fire risk and associated hazards."

We connect changes in the physical appearance of five US cities with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities."

However, the development of inherently safe energy devices is a key challenge, and aqueous Li-ion batteries draw large attention for this purpose. Due to the narrow electrochemical stable potential window of aqueous electrolytes, the energy density and the selection of negative electrode materials are significantly limited. For achieving durable and high-energy aqueous Li-ion batteries, the development of negative electrode materials exhibiting a large capacity and low potential without triggering decomposition of water is crucial. Herein, a type of a negative electrode material is proposed for high-energy aqueous Li-ion batteries. This work combines a high capacity with a safe negative electrode material through delivering the Mo-based oxide with unique nanosized and metastable characters. This work provides a new perspective for the development of inherently safe energy devices. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The results have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. The results also highlight the need to consider the role of natural landscapes in meeting nutrition goals, particularly in rural areas of low- and middle-income countries. This study also provides a proof of concept for the use of causal inference methods in the social sciences."
