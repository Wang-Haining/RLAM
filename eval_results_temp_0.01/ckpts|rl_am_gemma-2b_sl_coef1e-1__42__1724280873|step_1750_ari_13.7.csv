In this work, we demonstrate that neon can be enclathrated in ice II to form a hydrate. This finding has important implications for the understanding of the structure of ice II and the origin of the stability of ice II. It also provides a new route to the synthesis of hydrates, which are important in the study of the behavior of fluids under high pressure and temperature conditions. The results are expected to be of interest to researchers in a wide range of disciplines, including materials science, geophysics, and geochemistry."

Here we present a comparison of the genomes of two myxozoans and a cnidarian, with the goal of understanding the extent of the evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic myxozoan. Our results show that myxozoans are a sister taxon to the less reduced cnidarian parasite, P. hydriforme, and that the genome of a myxozoan is one of the smallest reported in animals. In addition, we find that myxozoans have a reduced gene content, especially in categories related to development, cell differentiation, and cell–cell communication. These results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by extreme reduction in gene content. This study provides insight into the evolution of the Myxozoa and the origin of the parasitic lifestyle. (Show more)"

Our results show that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of proton channels, but the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is largely unknown because species-level identification is prohibitively difficult with traditional methods. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species (six wild, one domestic) in semiarid African savanna. We found that species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption had the greatest dietary overlap. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammalian herbivore assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results also highlight the potential for DNA metabarcoding to provide quantitative information about diet composition. This approach could be used to quantify diet overlap and to identify the extent to which species partition food resources. Such information is critical for understanding the mechanisms that maintain biodiversity in African savanna. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Our observations of the size distribution of floating plastic debris point at important size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered.

This problem can be addressed by the development of new antibacterial agents to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. In this study, we present a rational design approach to identify new antibiotics. The approach is based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. We tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. The approach is expected to be a useful tool for the development of new antibiotics. The design strategy is also expected to be applicable to the design of new drugs for other diseases. (Show more)"

We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor.

Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to study the action of ADF/cofilin in different mechanical situations. We find that ADF/cofilin binds to filaments and that filament curvature favors severing. Surprisingly, tension has no effect on ADF/cofilin binding or severing. We also find that ADF/cofilin-induced filament twist enhances severing. A simple model, which we verify experimentally, indicates that the ADF/cofilin-induced twist increases the severing rate constant 100-fold.

Here we show that the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa detects contact with surfaces on short timescales using the mechanical activity of its type IV pili, a major surface adhesin. This signal transduction mechanism requires attachment of type IV pili to a solid surface, followed by pilus retraction and signal transduction through the Chp chemosensory system, a chemotaxis-like sensory system that regulates cAMP production and transcription of hundreds of genes, including key virulence factors. Our results thus support a mechanochemical model where a chemosensory system measures the mechanically induced conformational changes in stretched type IV pili. These findings demonstrate that P. aeruginosa not only uses type IV pili for surface-specific twitching motility, but also as a sensor regulating surface-induced gene expression and pathogenicity. This is the first demonstration of a type IV pili-based mechanosensitive signal transduction system in bacteria.

Thus, these observations constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI process. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI.

K+ channels are activated by membrane depolarization and inactivated by C-type inactivation. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that BK channels can be induced to show C-type inactivation by a low extracellular K+ concentration together with a mutation that causes a greatly accelerated rate of C-type inactivation or constitutive C-inactivation. C-type inactivation in BK channels is closed state-dependent and can occur during hyperpolarized membrane potentials or with decreased intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i). We propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. Our findings may help to understand the function of K+ channels and may be useful for the development of drugs for treating diseases. (Show more)

In temperate regions, seasonal influenza outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in ambient humidity. While low humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our study provides mechanistic insights into the impact of low humidity on influenza virus infection and disease outcome, and suggests that dry air may be a modifiable risk factor for influenza infection.

This merge operation is consistent with a bottom-up or left-corner parser of the incoming language stream.

Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. First, whereas MERS-CoV prefers human DPP4 over bat DPP4 as its receptor, HKU4 shows the opposite trend. Second, in the absence of exogenous proteases, both MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes mediate pseudovirus entry into bat cells, whereas only MERS-CoV spike, but not HKU4 spike, mediates pseudovirus entry into human cells. Thus, MERS-CoV, but not HKU4, has adapted to use human cells for cross-species transmissions.

The stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. In this study, we developed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. Surprisingly, the results indicate that human pol δ maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This study provides a unique perspective on the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme and its implications for lagging strand synthesis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

In the hypothesized RNA world, before the evolution of genetically encoded proteins, the replication of genetic information was accomplished by RNA molecules. In the laboratory, the replication of nucleic acids has been accomplished by proteins, but the replication of functional RNA molecules has been elusive. Here, we report the development of an RNA polymerase ribozyme that can synthesize functional RNA molecules from an RNA template. This RNA polymerase ribozyme can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins. This work represents a major step toward the realization of the RNA world. (Show more)"

Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

We also show that the glycan is provided and metabolized only at night, when the squid is active and the symbiont is producing light. This study provides a new perspective on the role of glycans in the regulation of host–microbe interactions.

There is an urgent need for novel and more efficient therapies, ideally targeting AML stem cells that are essential for maintaining the disease. Here, we show that monoclonal antibodies targeting the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. These results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML.

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GlpD) and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting.

This study provides deeper insight into immunologically privileged sites for microbial community residence in bats and supports the therapeutic potential of targeting MTX-LTA4H. This study also provides a deeper understanding of the role of the bat salivary gland in the evolution of the immune system and the potential for the use of MTX as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of viral diseases.

We show that formate, a one-carbon donor, rescues cells from SHMT inhibition, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Virions must first be cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. We found that the first cleavages severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Our findings suggest that the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence.

Although the molecular mechanisms of T2D are well established, the underlying mechanisms of insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction are still to be fully elucidated. Here, we show that STING, a key molecule in the innate immune system, is required for the maintenance of insulin secretion in β-cells. Our study provides a new perspective on the role of STING in the regulation of glucose homeostasis and insulin secretion. This study also establishes pathophysiological significance of fine-tuned STING within β-cells and insulin target tissues for maintaining glucose homeostasis.

Their genome is segmented into eight fragments, which offers evolutionary advantages but complicates genomic packaging. The existence of a selective packaging mechanism, in which one copy of each viral RNA is specifically packaged into each virion, is suspected, but its molecular details remain unknown. Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus. This interaction takes place in infected cells and is required for optimal viral replication. Disruption of this interaction nonspecifically decreased the amount of viral RNA in the viral particles, resulting in an eightfold increase in empty viral particles. Our experiments indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions. The lack of conservation of these interactions might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses. This study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of viral packaging and could lead to the development of new antiviral strategies. (Show more)"

We show that humans have vastly expanded the spatial and seasonal “fire niche” in the United States, accounting for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. Human-started wildfires disproportionally occurred where fuel moisture was higher than lightning-started fires, thereby helping expand the geographic and seasonal niche of wildfire.

Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

However, the anatomical and functional organization of these cell types is not fully understood. Here, we used a portable two-photon microscope to record the activity of a large number of neurons in freely behaving mice. We found that neurons that are thought to be involved in different aspects of navigation are not completely segregated, but instead show some degree of mixing. This finding suggests that the organization of MEC cell types is more complex than previously thought. It also provides a platform for future studies of the functional organization of MEC.

Nevertheless, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation.
