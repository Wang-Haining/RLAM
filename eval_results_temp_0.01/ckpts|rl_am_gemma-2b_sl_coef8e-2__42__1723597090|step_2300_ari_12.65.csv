In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

We found that the degree of overlap between species’ diets was greater than expected by chance, and that the degree of overlap was correlated with the degree of similarity in the proportion of grass consumption. These results suggest that the coexistence of large mammalian herbivores in the savanna is driven by the partitioning of the same resources, rather than by competition for the same resources. These findings have implications for our understanding of the drivers of biodiversity in the savanna biome. (Abridged)"

The architecture is based on a simple idea of using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice. We show that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data, compared to popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems. The proposed architecture is easy to implement, train, and apply in practice, and can be used for a wide range of problems. We believe that the proposed architecture will be useful for many image-processing problems."

We present a continuous, first-of-its-kind 1.3-My record of continental hydroclimate and lake-level variability derived from drill core data from Lake Malawi, East Africa. The results show evidence for 24 lake level drops of more than 200 m during the Late Quaternary, including 15 lowstands when water levels were more than 400 m lower than modern. A dramatic shift is observed at the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT), consistent with far-field climate forcing, which separates vastly different hydroclimate regimes before and after 800,000 years ago.

We also show that the presence of Ψ can promote the synthesis of multiple peptide products from a single mRNA sequence. Our results suggest that the presence of Ψ in an mRNA can impact the rate of protein synthesis. (Show more)"

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4.

We also show that the antifreeze glycoprotein binds the terminal d-alanine residue of the peptidoglycan cell wall, which alters the permeability of the gut and the ability of bacteria to form biofilms. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms by which pathogens influence the microbiota of their vector and may lead to the development of strategies to control the transmission of human pathogens.

Our results provide evidence for a series of climate-driven reintroductions of the bacterium into European harbors, with a delay of 15 ± 1 y.

We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR).

Thus, our data provide limited evidence of acclimation of soil respiration to experimental warming in several major biome types, contrary to the results from multiple single-site studies. Our analysis adds a unique cross-biome perspective on the temperature response of soil respiration, information critical to improving our mechanistic understanding of how soil carbon dynamics change with climatic warming.

The results show that anthropogenic climate change increased the probability of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% by the year 2100 under an intermediate-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5) and to 80% under a high-emission scenario (SSP5-8.5). These results highlight the strong sensitivity of the drought risk in South Africa to future anthropogenic emissions. The results are important for the design of adaptation strategies and for the development of climate change scenarios for water resources management. View Full-Text

However, the factors that contribute to virus spillover from bats are largely unknown. Here, we identified and characterized a protein that is highly concentrated in the submandibular salivary gland of the bat, Myotis pilosus. This protein, named MTX, selectively inhibits the function of leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) to inhibit the generation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a potent lipid chemoattractant for host defense against infection. MTX has no effect on the aminopeptidase function of LTA4H and therefore does not impair the antiinflammatory function of LTA4H. MTX potently inhibits proinflammatory proteases to induce immune tolerance and maintain high stability. This study provides deeper insight into immunologically privileged sites for microbial community residence in bats and supports the therapeutic potential of targeting MTX-LTA4H. This study also provides a deeper understanding of the factors that contribute to virus spillover from bats. (Show more)"

Rather, the inclusion bodies in ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive design-based analysis of the effect of universal vote-by-mail—a policy under which every voter is mailed a ballot in advance of the election—on electoral outcomes. We find that universal vote-by-mail does not appear to affect either party’s share of turnout, does not appear to increase either party’s vote share, and modestly increases overall average turnout rates, in line with previous estimates. All three conclusions support the conventional wisdom of election administration experts and contradict many popular claims in the media. Our findings suggest that vote-by-mail programs are not likely to have a significant impact on the outcome of elections."

Energy limitation and altered symbiotic nutrient cycling are thus key factors in the early heat stress response, directly contributing to the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis.

First, more diverse communities are more likely to contain species with thermal traits that enable them to maintain productivity as temperatures shift from ambient conditions. Second, we find a pronounced increase in the contribution of complementarity to the net biodiversity effect at high and low temperatures, indicating that changes in species interactions play a critical role in mediating the impacts of temperature change on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function.
