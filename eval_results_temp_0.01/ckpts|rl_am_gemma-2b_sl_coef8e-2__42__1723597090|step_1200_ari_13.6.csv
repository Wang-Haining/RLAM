However, the structure of ice II with a guest molecule dissolved in it has not been reported. Here, we report the structure of ice II with neon dissolved in it. The structure is determined by in situ neutron diffraction at 480 MPa and 260 K. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The guest Ne atoms are found to be distributed along the channels and in planes perpendicular to the channels. The guest Ne atoms are also found to be constrained by interactions between adjacent Ne atoms. The structure is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. The structure is expected to be important for the understanding of the origin of life. The structure is also expected to be important for the understanding of the structure of ice Ih with a guest molecule dissolved in it."

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to block nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are critical for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We found that the viral accessory protein Orf6 is responsible for this activity and that it localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1. Our data reveal a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the host immune system and may lead to the development of new antiviral strategies. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv"

We show that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields will increase to values much larger than present-day values as the global mean temperature increases. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. They also underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance."

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammals in semiarid African savanna. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers. Grass consumption was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of % grass consumption, indicating that RRA conveys reliable quantitative information about consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized."

These results suggest that the island was colonized by multiple waves of migration, and that the genetic structure is the result of a combination of admixture and demographic growth.

The common cold is caused by rhinoviruses, which replicate more robustly at the cool temperatures found in the nasal cavity than at core body temperature. To gain insight into the mechanism of temperature-dependent growth, we compared the transcriptional response of primary mouse airway epithelial cells infected with rhinovirus at 33 °C vs. 37 °C. We found that mouse airway cells infected with rhinovirus exhibited a striking enrichment in expression of antiviral defense response genes at 37 °C relative to 33 °C, which correlated with significantly higher expression levels of type I and type III IFN genes and ISGs at 37 °C. These findings demonstrate that in mouse airway cells, rhinovirus replicates preferentially at nasal cavity temperature due, in part, to a less efficient antiviral defense response of infected cells at cool temperature.

Here we show that the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses the mechanical activity of its type IV pili to sense the surface on which it is growing. This mechanism is important for the pathogen because it allows it to sense the presence of a surface and to respond to it by increasing the activity of its type IV pili, which in turn promotes the attachment of the bacterium to the surface. This attachment, in turn, can stimulate the production of additional virulence factors. Our findings thus demonstrate that type IV pili are not only used for twitching motility, but also as a sensor that regulates the attachment of the bacterium to a surface.

The observations show that the aerosol loading has no discernible effect on the liquid water path, but it does affect the cloud droplet number concentration and effective radius.

K+ channels commonly possess two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. These findings may help us understand the mechanism of the BK channel’s unique properties. They may also provide a new approach to drug development for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. (Read more)"

The invasion process is a complex interaction between parasite and host cell, and the role of the erythrocyte in the process is poorly understood. Here, we show that the malaria parasite alters the biophysical properties of the erythrocyte, increasing the cytoskeletal tension and reducing the bending modulus of the membrane. These changes are correlated with the invasion process, suggesting that the parasite primes the erythrocyte surface, reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion. This finding would constitute a major change in our understanding of malaria parasite invasion, suggesting it is, in fact, a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces working together to facilitate entry. This is an important step in understanding the invasion process and the development of new strategies for malaria control. (Show more)"

We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

The stability of this complex is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. Here, we show that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA at a DNA lesion. This study provides a unique insight into the mechanism of human lagging strand replication. (Show more)"

In the hypothesized RNA world, before the evolution of proteins, genetic information was stored in RNA molecules that were replicated by ribozymes. In the laboratory, RNA molecules can be replicated by RNA ribozymes, but the process is inefficient and the resulting molecules are of low quality. Here, we report the results of an in vitro evolution experiment that improved the activity and generality of an RNA polymerase ribozyme. The improved polymerase ribozyme can synthesize a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and, in low yield, even tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins."

This epidemic marked the start of the second plague pandemic, which lasted in Europe until the early 19th century. This pandemic is generally understood as the consequence of a singular introduction of Yersinia pestis, after which the disease established itself in European rodents over four centuries. To locate these putative plague reservoirs, we studied the climate fluctuations that preceded regional plague epidemics, based on a dataset of 7,711 georeferenced historical plague outbreaks and 15 annually resolved tree-ring records from Europe and Asia. We provide evidence for repeated climate-driven reintroductions of the bacterium into European harbors from reservoirs in Asia, with a delay of 15 ± 1 y. Our analysis finds no support for the existence of permanent plague reservoirs in medieval Europe. (Show more)"

The device configuration also enables application of optical tweezers for controlled placement of atoms. The device can be fabricated reliably from a 200-nm silicon nitride device layer using a lithography-based process, producing predicted optical properties in transmission and reflection measurements. These 2D photonic crystal devices can be readily deployed to experiments for many-body physics with neutral atoms and engineering of exotic quantum matter. The device can also be used for quantum information processing. The device is scalable to larger dimensions and can be used for many-body physics with neutral atoms and engineering of exotic quantum matter.

Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities."

It regulates the absorption of nutrients, mounts immune responses, and prevents systemic infections. In this study, we investigate the consequences of tumorigenesis on the microbiome using a Drosophila intestinal tumor model. We show that upon loss of BMP signaling, tumors lead to aberrant activation of JNK/Mmp2 signaling, followed by intestinal barrier dysfunction and commensal imbalance. In turn, the dysbiotic microbiome triggers a regenerative response and stimulates tumor growth. We find that inhibiting JNK signaling or depletion of the microbiome restores barrier function of the intestinal epithelium, leading to a reestablishment of host–microbe homeostasis, and organismic lifespan extension. Our experiments identify a JNK-dependent feedback amplification loop between intestinal tumors and the microbiome. They also highlight the importance of controlling the activity level of JNK signaling to maintain epithelial barrier function and host–microbe homeostasis.

This leads to a reduction in the electrical activity of the SAN, as is evident by a reduction in heart rate and an exaggerated autonomic response to cholinergic signaling. These studies reveal that STIM1 is a key regulator of Ca2+ stores in SAN cells and contributes to the electrical activity of the SAN. (Show more)"

However, the function of Si in plant physiology has been debated for decades. In addition, the jasmonate (JA) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in mediating antiherbivore defense responses in plants. However, the interaction between Si and JA in response to insect attack has not been examined directly. In this study, we show that Si pretreatment increases rice resistance against the rice leaffolder in wild-type plants but not in RNAi lines of allene oxide synthase and CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1. Additionally, Si pretreatment promotes Si accumulation and enhances rice resistance against the rice leaffolder. These results suggest a strong interaction between Si and JA in defense against insect herbivores involving priming of JA-mediated defense responses by Si and the promotion of Si accumulation by JA. This study provides insights into the role of Si in plant defense against insect herbivores. (Show more)"

We show that information can be stored in the form of adaptive changes in the excitability of neurons. These changes in conductances can be accessed directly without cued retrieval. We demonstrate that this mechanism is sensitive to context and serial order which makes it suitable for temporal integration in sequence processing within the language domain.

This study reveals that small tributaries may be a significant source of nutrients to coastal areas, and that nutrient management efforts should consider the role of small watersheds in coastal eutrophication. Our findings have important implications for the management of nutrient inputs to lakes and reservoirs worldwide."

These findings offer mechanistic insights into circuit-level dysfunction induced by NMDAR-Abs. They also suggest that NMDAR-Abs may be able to cause paroxysmal EEG abnormalities even in the absence of neuronal injury. This may be important for understanding the mechanisms of action of NMDAR-Abs and the development of new therapies. (Show more)"

In response, many major corporations and countries have made commitments to purchase or produce only “sustainable” palm oil. Certification is the tool most used to fulfill these procurement policies, and around 20% of global palm oil production is certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). However, the effect of certification on deforestation in oil palm plantations remains unclear. Here, we show that certification is associated with reduced deforestation in Indonesia. Nevertheless, most plantations contained little residual forest when they received certification. As a result, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation."

Here we show that a key derived feature of the human hand, the third metacarpal styloid process, was present ∼1.42 My ago in a fossil from Kenya. This fossil thus provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key shared derived characteristic of modern human and Neandertal hand morphology and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato.
