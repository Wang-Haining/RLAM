However, the structure of hydrate is still controversial. In this work, we report the structure of neon hydrate at high pressure and temperature. The structure of neon hydrate is different from that of conventional hydrate. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. This work provides a new insight into the structure of hydrate. It also provides a new way to store gases at high pressure and temperature. This work is expected to be of great significance for the development of hydrate technology."

However, this description is incomplete because it does not specify the mathematical structure of the states. In this paper, we provide a categorical description of quantum theory in which the states are elements of a category of Hilbert spaces. The axioms of the theory are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. This approach is motivated by reconstruction programs such as those of von Neumann, Mackey, Jauch, Piron, Abramsky, and Coecke. The theory is shown to be complete in the sense that every functor from the category of states to the category of sets can be extended to a state. The theory is also shown to be internally consistent in the sense that every state is a terminal object in the category of states. Finally, the theory is shown to be internally categorical in the sense that every state is equivalent to a state of the form of a Hilbert space."

Although the evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the genomes and transcriptomes of two distantly related myxozoan species and a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. These results provide insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Show more)"

The virus has been shown to interfere with the host immune response by blocking interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral signaling. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 uses a previously unknown mechanism to block nuclear import of STAT1 and STAT2 transcription factors. We found that the viral accessory protein ORF6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain. We also show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its ability to block nuclear import. Our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of interferon. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the host immune response and may lead to the development of new antiviral strategies.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some proton channel residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

We use global datasets of maize production and climate variability to quantify how yield variability will change in the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. We find that the probability of simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year increases from 0% to 7% under 2 °C warming and to 86% under 4 °C warming.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is largely unknown because species-level identification is prohibitively difficult with traditional methods. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammal species in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results highlight the importance of diet composition in understanding the role of LMH in African savanna biodiversity. This information is critical for predicting the consequences of LMH loss and fragmentation in a changing world."

However, the global load of plastic debris on the open ocean surface is still unknown. We used data from circumnavigation cruises to show that the distribution of plastic debris on the open ocean surface is worldwide, mostly accumulating in the convergence zones of the five subtropical gyres. However, the global load of plastic debris on the open ocean surface was estimated to be on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This discrepancy is explained by the size distribution of plastic debris, which points at important size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

We determined the ages of 40 large presolar silicon carbide grains extracted from the Murchison CM2 meteorite. The grains have interstellar cosmic ray exposure ages of &lt;300 Ma to ∼3 Ga. A majority of the grains have interstellar lifetimes of &lt;300 Ma, which is shorter than theoretical estimates for large grains. Longer lifetimes are expected for large grains. We estimate that the majority of the grains acquired the bulk of their cosmogenic nuclides in the interstellar medium and not by exposure to an enhanced particle flux of the early active sun. This result is important for the understanding of the formation of presolar grains and the origin of the early solar system. It also has implications for the origin of the carbonaceous chondrites.

We further demonstrate that the low probability to become dominant in high-anxious animals is reversed by microinfusion of mitochondrial inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens.

This reversal is mediated by reduced protein expression of the transcription factor BCL11A. These results suggest a mechanism for chronoregulation of Hb expression in humans. This mechanism may be relevant to the development of hemoglobinopathies and to the chronologic control of Hb expression in the human embryo. This work also provides a potential target for the treatment of hemoglobinopathies. This work also provides a potential target for the treatment of hemoglobinopathies.

In this study, we found that activating mutation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) function, highly frequent events in human cancer, confers ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells. This resistance requires sustained activation of mTORC1 and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)C1-dependent induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. Furthermore, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a transcriptional target of SREBP1, mediates the ferroptosis-suppressing activity of SREBP1 by producing monounsaturated fatty acids. Genetic or pharmacologic ablation of SREBP1 or SCD1 sensitized ferroptosis in cancer cells with PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway mutation. Conversely, ectopic expression of SREPB1 or SCD1 restored ferroptosis resistance in these cells, even when mTORC"

The underlying mechanisms of hypertension are complex and include the vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) remodeling. VSMC remodeling is characterized by molecular rewiring of the cellular Ca2+ signaling machinery, including down-regulation of voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channel (Cav1.2) channels and up-regulation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stromal-interacting molecule (STIM) Ca2+ sensor proteins and the plasma membrane ORAI Ca2+ channels. STIM/ORAI proteins mediate store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) and drive fibro-proliferative gene programs during cardiovascular remodeling. We show that the three major classes of L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs) activate STIM/ORAI-mediated Ca2+ entry in VSMCs. LCCBs act on the STIM N terminus to cause STIM relocalization to junctions and subsequent ORAI activation in a Cav1.2-independent and store depletion-independent manner. LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. Our data indicate caution against the use of LCC"

Early-seral–associated bird populations declined on federal lands, but not on private lands where clearcutting stopped. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure. The NWFP is a model for policy that incorporates monitoring and adaptive management. We hope that our findings will help inform the development of similar policies in other regions."

To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

Here, we introduce a network architecture based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data. This architecture can be applied to other problems as well. We believe that this architecture will be useful for the community."

Today, most human plague cases are caused by inhalation of infectious droplets, but the historical spread of plague in Europe during the Second Pandemic (14–19th centuries) is poorly understood. We developed a compartmental model for plague transmission by a human ectoparasite vector. Using Bayesian inference, we found that this model fits mortality curves from nine outbreaks in Europe better than models for rodent or pneumonic transmission. Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346–1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats. This work provides a better understanding of the history of plague in Europe and may help to inform the development of effective control strategies for the current pandemic caused by the zoonotic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2."

However, the evolution of brain power is more complex and requires a different approach. We use the largest dataset of its kind to reconstruct the evolution of brain neuronal density across amniotes. We show that reptiles have not only small brains relative to body size but also low neuronal densities, resulting in average neuron numbers over 20 times lower than those in birds and mammals of similar body size. Amniote brain evolution is characterized by the following four major shifts in neuron–brain scaling. The most dramatic increases in brain neurons occurred independently with the appearance of birds and mammals, resulting in convergent neuron scaling in the two endothermic lineages. The other two major increases in the number of neurons happened in core land birds and anthropoid primates, which are two groups known for their cognitive prowess."

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal and transformed cells is more complex than previously appreciated. We have shown that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This study also provides a rationale for the development of TRAP1-targeted therapies. (Show more)"

Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to study the action of ADF/cofilin in different mechanical situations. We find that ADF/cofilin enhances severing of filaments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist. This mechanism is critical to boost ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. We propose that it is a general mechanism that is used by other regulators of actin filament disassembly.

We demonstrate that type IV pili are involved in twitching motility, a process that is important for surface attachment. We also show that type IV pili are involved in the sensing of surfaces, and that this process is mediated by the Chp chemosensory system. This system is similar to the chemotaxis system, and it regulates the production of cAMP and the expression of hundreds of genes, including key virulence factors. Our results thus demonstrate that type IV pili are used by P. aeruginosa as a sensor for surfaces, and as a regulator of surface-induced virulence.

SOC systems are characterized by a critical state, where the system is always in a state of criticality, and by a mechanism that drives the system to criticality from any initial state. In this paper, we report on our discovery of a tropical model with self-organized criticality (SOC) behavior. Our model is continuous, in contrast to all known models of SOC, and is a certain scaling limit of the sandpile model, the first and archetypical model of SOC. We describe how our model is related to pattern formation and proportional growth phenomena and discuss the dichotomy between continuous and discrete models in several contexts. Our aim in this context is to present an idealized tropical toy model (cf. Turing reaction-diffusion model), requiring further investigation."

It also exhibited strong binding to fungal cell walls and penetrated the cell membrane at discrete foci, followed by accumulation in the cytoplasm and elevated levels in nucleoli of germlings.

Mutations in VWF cause the common bleeding disorder, von Willebrand disease (VWD). We show that force application to platelets switches the VWF receptor, glycoprotein Ibα (GPIbα), to a second state with faster on-rate, providing a mechanism for activating VWF binding to platelets. This explains the pathophysiology of VWD. The conversion of single molecule kon (s−1) to bulk phase kon (s−1M−1) and the kon and koff values extrapolated to zero force for the low-force pathways show remarkably good agreement with bulk-phase measurements.

We here present evidence that the surface temperature of Earth decreased from ∼65–80 °C in the Archean to the present ∼15 °C.

K+ channels commonly possess two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We hypothesized that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We induced C-type inactivation in BK channels and studied the relationship between activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery. We found that the BK channel C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. Our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanism of K+ channel gating and C-type inactivation.

The parasite, Plasmodium, uses a variety of mechanisms to invade the human red blood cell (RBC), the target of infection. Here, we show that the malaria parasite uses the erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 (EBA175) to alter the biophysical properties of the RBC. We show that EBA175 binding to glycophorin A (GPA) on the RBC surface leads to an increase in the cytoskeletal tension of the cell and a reduction in the bending modulus of the cell’s membrane. These changes in the RBC are correlated with parasite invasion efficiency. This finding suggests that the malaria parasite primes the erythrocyte surface through its binding antigens, altering the biophysical nature of the target cell and thus reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion. This would constitute a major change in our concept of malaria parasite invasion, suggesting it is, in fact, a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces working together to facilitate entry. This work provides a new perspective on the invasion process and opens up new avenues for the development of new antimalarial drugs."

In temperate regions, seasonal influenza outbreaks correlate with decreases in ambient humidity. However, the impact of humidity on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low humidity makes them more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

This merge operation is consistent with the idea that the brain uses a bottom-up parser to extract the structure of the incoming language stream.

We found that this effect is mediated by a circuit involving dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Stimulation of the LH causes dopamine neurons in the VTA to release dopamine, which in turn inhibits dopamine neurons in the SNc. This inhibition of SNc dopamine neurons is necessary for the stimulation-induced eating. We also found that stimulation of the LH causes dopamine neurons in a more caudal region of the hypothalamus to release dopamine, which in turn inhibits neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC).

However, the time of its origin and its early evolution have been difficult to study due to the scarcity of ancient genomes. Here, we present 17 ancient Y. pestis genomes from Eurasia dating to the Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age. We show that the plague pathogen underwent a series of evolutionary steps before its emergence, and that it rapidly spread across Eurasia. We also show that the plague pathogen diversified in the Bronze Age in Iberia, a region that was previously thought to be a late adopter of the plague pathogen. These data provide insights into the early evolution of the plague pathogen and its spread across Eurasia. (Show more)"

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, in the days (Studies 1 and 2) and months (Studies 3 through 6) following the 2016 American presidential election, women’s and men’s endorsement of HM predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. In addition, as conceptualized, HM was associated with less trust in the government (Study 3), more sexism (Study 4), more racism (Study 5), and more xenophobia (Study 6) but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors.

These practices include reduced tillage, diversified crop rotations with cover crops and legumes, and manure addition. These results highlight the potential of well-managed grasslands to sequester carbon and provide a framework for the development of climate-smart agricultural systems.

In addition, functional variants indicate that they also differed in visible characteristics. This example of female-biased migration indicates that complex demographic processes during the Early Medieval period may have contributed in an unexpected way to shape the modern European genetic landscape.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions. Our findings are important for understanding the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and for developing effective countermeasures against future bat coronavirus threats to human health.

In the laboratory, RNA molecules can be evolved to have catalytic activity, but the activity of an RNA polymerase ribozyme that can synthesize RNA from an RNA template has not been demonstrated. Here, we describe the construction of such a polymerase ribozyme and its use to synthesize a variety of RNA molecules, including aptamers, ribozymes, and tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase ribozyme can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins.

These results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities. Our results also suggest that the physical appearance of neighborhoods is a key determinant of economic outcomes and that urban planners and policymakers should consider the physical appearance of neighborhoods when planning for the future.

We report that hypoxia induces expression of AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), which demethylates N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications on mRNA. ALKBH5 expression is increased in BCSCs, and is HIF-dependent. ALKBH5 overexpression increases the percentage of BCSCs, and knockdown of ALKBH5 expression decreases the BCSC phenotype. Thus, ALKBH5 expression is induced by hypoxia, and mediates enrichment of BCSCs in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. This study provides insight into the molecular mechanisms that regulate BCSC numbers, and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for breast cancer.

We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals, but we did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides. This method is noninvasive and can be used to identify the animal origin of parchment in the field.

We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML.

Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR).

We present a model of the molecular evolution of plastid genomes under progressively relaxed functional constraints during the transition from autotrophy to a parasitic lifestyle. We show that the loss of photosynthesis is linked to the establishment of a parasitic lifestyle, characterized by the parasite’s dependence on a host to fulfill its life cycle. Our findings suggest that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner.

We use a high-resolution large ensemble to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the probability of occurrence of multiyear rainfall deficits in southwestern South Africa. We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% by the year 2100 under an intermediate-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5) and to 80% under a high-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5-8.5). These results highlight the strong sensitivity of the drought risk in southwestern South Africa to future anthropogenic emissions. This work is important for water resource managers and policy makers in South Africa and other regions that are vulnerable to climate change. It also provides a useful example of how climate models can be used to inform decision-making.

Photosynthesis relies on these modified tetrapyrroles for the capture of solar radiation and its conversion to chemical energy. The formation of the isocyclic fifth ring, the key reaction in the biosynthesis of (bacterio)chlorophyll pigments, has remained enigmatic for more than 60 y. This reaction is catalyzed by two unrelated cyclase enzymes using different chemistries. The majority of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria use O2-sensitive [4Fe-4S] cluster proteins, whereas plants, cyanobacteria, and some phototrophic bacteria possess an O2-dependent enzyme, the major catalytic component of which is a diiron protein. Plant and cyanobacterial mutants in ycf54 display impaired function of the O2-dependent enzyme, accumulating the reaction substrate. These results indicate that Ycf54 is a cyclase subunit in oxygenic phototrophs, and that different classes of the enzyme exist based on their requirement for an additional subunit. AcsF is the cyclase in R. gelatinosus, whereas alphaproteobacterial cyclases require a newly discovered protein that we"

However, the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms of ASK1 in neuroinflammation remain unknown. In this study, we generated conditional knockout (CKO) mice that lack ASK1 in T cells, dendritic cells, microglia/macrophages, microglia, or astrocytes, to assess the roles of ASK1 during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We found that ASK1 deficiency in microglia/macrophages and astrocytes reduced neuroinflammation in the later stage of EAE, whereas ASK1 deficiency in T cells and dendritic cells had no significant effects on EAE severity. ASK1 signaling in microglia/macrophages plays a major role in generating and maintaining disease. Activated astrocytes produce key inflammatory mediators, including CCL2, which further activated and recruited microglia/macrophages, in an astrocytic ASK1-dependent manner.

The causal pathways that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility are not well understood. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a framework for understanding the causal pathways that lead to the core autistic symptoms.

To explain the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in the brain and spinal cord, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis remain unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We found that pol II stalling at O2-EtdT and N3-EtdT sites is exacerbated by TFIIS-stimulated proofreading activity. We also identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop). The Pro-Gate loop faces toward the minor groove of RNA:DNA hybrid and is involved in modulating the translocation of minor-groove alkylated DNA template after nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion. Taken together, this work provides important mechanistic insights into transcriptional stalling, lesion bypass, and mutagenesis of alkylated DNA lesions. This work will be helpful for understanding the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced mutagenesis and for developing novel strategies for DNA alkylation-induced mutagenesis-based"

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Virions must first be cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. We found that the first cleavages are significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence. Without the first cleavages, MERS viruses resisted conformational changes that restricted the second fusion-activating cleavages, which were required for MERS-CoV infection of human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence. These findings may be relevant to the pathogenesis of other coronaviruses."

Here, we demonstrate that ets variant 2 (ETV2) alone can directly convert primary human adult skin fibroblasts into functional vascular endothelial cells (ETVECs). In coordination with endogenous FOXC2 in fibroblasts, transduced ETV2 elicits expression of multiple key endothelial development factors, including FLI1, ERG, and TAL1, and induces expression of endothelial functional molecules, including EGFL7 and von Willebrand factor. Consequently, ETVECs exhibits EC characteristics in vitro and forms mature functional vasculature in Matrigel plugs transplanted in NOD SCID mice.

We also find that freshwater fisheries provide the equivalent of all dietary animal protein for 158 million people, highlighting the critical role of rivers in providing locally sourced, low-cost protein. At the same time, intensive fishing in regions where rivers are already degraded by other stressors may undermine efforts to conserve biodiversity. This syndrome of poverty, nutritional deficiency, fishery dependence, and extrinsic threats to biodiverse river ecosystems underscores the high stakes for improving fishery management. Our enhanced spatial data on estimated catches can facilitate the inclusion of inland fisheries in environmental planning to protect both food security and species diversity.

This DLK-independent regeneration is triggered by physical lesion of a sensory neuron and is enhanced by disrupting calcium signaling. These findings suggest that DLK-independent regeneration is a powerful platform for discovery of genes involved in neuronal regeneration.

Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning becomes steeper, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. This is important because the majority of species extinctions are predicted to occur as a result of environmental warming.

This is especially important in the Anthropocene, when human activities are driving unprecedented changes to the global nitrogen cycle."

We find that the long-time dynamics of such systems are biased toward states that exhibit a fine-tuned extremization of environmental forcing. This behavior is reminiscent of the “fine-tuning problem” in cosmology, where the rare combination of initial conditions that led to the observed universe is contrasted with the vast majority of possible initial conditions. We propose that the same mechanism may be at work in the chemical world."

Although NMDAR-Abs are believed to disrupt receptor function, the mechanisms underlying the paroxysmal EEG abnormalities that are a hallmark of NMDAR-Abs are poorly understood. Here we show that NMDAR-Abs change the intrinsic cortical microcircuit and neuronal population dynamics to alter the spectral composition of spontaneous EEG activity and predispose brain dynamics to paroxysmal abnormalities. These findings offer mechanistic insights into circuit-level dysfunction induced by NMDAR-Abs. They also suggest that NMDAR-Abs may be a useful model for studying the mechanisms underlying the paroxysmal EEG abnormalities that are a hallmark of autoimmune encephalitis. This may lead to the development of new therapies for these conditions."

However, the history of carbon perturbation events is poorly understood. Here, we present a multiproxy approach to investigate an abrupt carbon perturbation and global warming event (∼304 Ma) that occurred during a paleo-glacial state. We report pronounced negative carbon and uranium isotopic excursions coincident with a doubling of atmospheric CO2 partial pressure and a biodiversity nadir. The isotopic excursions can be linked to an injection of organic matter–derived carbon over a large area and to near 20% of areal extent of seafloor anoxia. Earth system modeling indicates that widespread anoxic conditions can be linked to enhanced thermocline stratification and increased nutrient fluxes during this global warming within an icehouse. This work provides insights into the history of carbon perturbation events and the Earth system. It also provides a case study for the potential effects of global warming in icehouse states.

We show that RSPO certification reduced deforestation in Indonesia from 2001 to 2015. However, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results suggest that certification is a useful tool for reducing deforestation, but it is not a silver bullet. We conclude that certification is most effective when combined with other policies. Our results also suggest that certification is most effective when combined with other policies. Our results also suggest that certification is most effective when combined with other policies."

In vertebrates, sex is determined by a single locus, resulting in two sexes and two sexes only. However, in many species, sex is determined by multiple alleles, allowing for more than two sexes. In this study, we investigate the effects of multiple alleles on the secondary sexual characteristics of a single species. We find that multiple alleles can produce a modular system of sexual polymorphism, allowing for the evolution of new phenotypes and behaviors. This study provides insight into the evolutionary causes and consequences of multiple alleles in sex determination. (Show more)"

We sought to understand how Fe levels impact the retina, given that retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are also challenged by accumulations of vitamin A aldehyde adducts (bisretinoid lipofuscin) that photogenerate reactive oxygen species and photodecompose into damaging aldehyde- and dicarbonyl-bearing species. We found that intracellular Fe promotes bisretinoid oxidation and degradation. This interpretation was supported by experiments showing that Fe chelation decreased the oxidative/degradation of the bisretinoid A2E in the presence of light and reduced cell death in cell-based experiments. Moreover, light-independent oxidation and degradation of A2E by Fenton chemistry products were evidenced by the consumption of A2E, release of dicarbonyls, and generation of oxidized A2E species in cell-free assays. These findings indicate that Fe is a key regulator of the oxidative stress response in the retina. This work provides insight into the role of Fe in the retina and may have implications for the development of therapies to protect the retina from oxidative damage. (Show more)"

Here we report the discovery of a hominin hand from East Africa that preserves a key derived feature of the modern human hand, the third metacarpal styloid process. This fossil provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of this key derived feature of the human hand and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo.

We have developed a small-molecule inhibitor of SHMT, which we use to identify a cancer cell-line screen. We show that SHMT inhibition is particularly effective in B-cell lines, and that this effect is rooted in defective glycine import. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. This work provides a rationale for the use of SHMT inhibitors in cancer therapy, and identifies a glycine import pathway as a targetable metabolic deficiency of this cancer.

This study shows that the weight of farm machinery has increased the risk of subsoil compaction, with the risk of subsoil compaction now affecting 20% of arable land. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This study highlights the need for a more holistic approach to the design of farm machinery, which considers the ecological context of the soil. This will help to ensure that the benefits of mechanization are not offset by the negative impacts of subsoil compaction.
