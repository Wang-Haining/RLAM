Although the evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we compare the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insight into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Show more)"

In this study, we describe a mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, is able to block the nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are essential for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of proton channels, but the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

We find that the probability of simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year increases from 0% to 86% under 4 °C warming.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species of African herbivores. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers. Grass consumption inferred from mean sequence relative read abundance ranged from &gt;99% (plains zebra) to &lt;1% (dik-dik). Grass RRA was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of % grass consumption, indicating that RRA conveys reliable quantitative information about consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of size-matched grazers—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammal assemblages, and that large mammal diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.

Our observations of the size distribution of floating plastic debris point at important size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale.

The disease is characterized by the accumulation of alpha-synuclein (α-syn) aggregates in affected oligodendrocytes. Several studies point to α-syn oligomerization and aggregation as a mediator of neurotoxicity in synucleinopathies including MSA. Here, we show that the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 is able to limit the progressive toxicity of α-syn aggregation in a mouse model of MSA. This effect is associated with a reduction of truncated α-syn and its monomeric and oligomeric forms. Finally, VX-765 showed neuroprotective effects by preserving tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in the substantia nigra of MSA mice.

The treatment of hypertension is the most important strategy to prevent heart failure. The most common drugs for treating hypertension are the voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channel (Cav1.2) blockers (LCCBs). We show that LCCBs activate the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stromal-interacting molecule (STIM) Ca2+ sensor proteins and the plasma membrane ORAI Ca2+ channels. LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. This study unravels a mechanism of LCCBs action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrates that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. Our data provide a rationale for the use of LCCBs in the treatment of hypertension. This study also provides a rationale for the use of LCCBs in the treatment of hypertension.

This problem can be addressed by the development of new antibacterial agents to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. In this study, we present a rational design approach to identify new acylide antibiotics.

The best candidate is synthetically more accessible, exhibits higher solubility and binding affinity to the ribosome, and is up to 56 times more active against resistant pathogens than telithromycin. Notably, the best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

The energy released by the impact would have also caused the ejection of debris into the atmosphere, which could have led to the formation of a dust layer.

These social-learning conditions were compared with an asocial individual-learning condition in which individual participants made repeated attempts at constructing a paper plane, without having access to any planes produced by other participants.

Here, we report a novel role for APOE in controlling the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes. APOE2 enhances the rate of phagocytosis of synapses by astrocytes, whereas APO4 decreases it. We also found that the amount of C1q protein accumulation in hippocampus, which may represent the accumulation of senescent synapses with enhanced vulnerability to complement-mediated degeneration, is highly dependent on APOE alleles. These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes.

However, the evolution of brain power, which is the product of both size and number of neurons, has received much less attention. This study shows that the evolution of brain power in amniotes is characterized by four major shifts. The most dramatic increase in brain power happened with the evolution of birds and mammals. This is followed by two smaller increases in brain power in core land birds and anthropoid primates. These results have important implications for studies using relative brain size as a proxy when looking for evolutionary drivers of animal cognition."

We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor.

They are dynamic polymers that can be assembled and disassembled. The process of disassembly is controlled by the cofilin family of proteins. In this work, we show that cofilin can sever actin filaments in a mechanical context. We demonstrate that the mechanical torque that cofilin induces on filaments is critical for the process. We propose that this mechanism is important for cells, where actin filaments are highly connected and under mechanical stress. Our work provides a mechanism for how cells can control the disassembly of actin filaments in a mechanical context. This is important for understanding the role of cofilin in cells. It may also lead to the development of new tools for controlling the dynamics of actin filaments."

We also found that the settlement of Madagascar happened in a sex-biased way, with a recent demographic growth. Finally, we found that the genetic structure is not only due to the recent admixture, but also due to the geography of Madagascar.

The vast majority of Ψ moieties in mRNAs are found in coding regions, and our study suggests that one consequence of the ribosome encountering Ψ can be to modestly alter both translation speed and mRNA decoding.

In this study, we show that the decapping enzyme responsible for removing the cap from Np4-capped RNAs in bacteria, ApaH, is also capable of removing the cap from Np4-capped transcripts. However, ApaH is not the predominant decapping enzyme in cells experiencing stress. Instead, a second enzyme, RppH, is the primary degrader of Np4-capped transcripts. This enzyme recognizes Np4-capped 5′ termini by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5′ termini, resulting in a one-nucleotide shift in substrate specificity. The unconventional manner in which RppH recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress.

We also demonstrate that female-derived proteins become enriched in the sperm proteome immediately after mating and continue to do so for at least 4 d. These findings provide a comprehensive characterization of the posttesticular life history of the sperm proteome and expand our understanding of the critical process of sperm–FRT interactions.

However, the ACI process is difficult to be well represented in current climate models. This is due to the complexity of the process and the lack of observational capability. Here, we introduce a new instrument, the dual-field-of-view high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL), which can provide simultaneous observations of aerosols and clouds. The HSRL is capable of providing high-resolution observations of aerosols and clouds, especially water cloud microphysical properties. We demonstrate the scientific potential of the HSRL by analyzing a case study over Beijing. The observations show that the aerosol loading increased the droplet number concentration and decreased the droplet effective radius, which is consistent with expectations. However, the aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI.

They are also the main targets of drugs. Ion channels are activated by the influx of cations, and they are deactivated by the efflux of cations. The activation and deactivation of ion channels are controlled by two gates, one at the intracellular end and the other at the selectivity filter. The activation gate is responsible for fast channel activation/deactivation, whereas the selectivity filter gate is responsible for slow channel activation/deactivation. We found that the BK channel lacks an intracellular activation gate and normally shows no C-type inactivation. We also found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. This study provides a new perspective on the regulation of ion channels. (Show more)"

Here, we show that the malaria parasite alters the physical properties of the host cell, increasing the cytoskeletal tension and reducing the bending modulus of the membrane. These changes are correlated with the invasion process, suggesting that the parasite is priming the host cell to facilitate invasion. This is a major change in our understanding of the invasion process and suggests that the parasite and host cell are working together to facilitate entry. This is an important finding, as it suggests that invasion is a dynamic process, with multiple forces working together to facilitate entry.

In the temperate regions, seasonal outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in ambient humidity. While low humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes them more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

Here, we show that the brain’s activity during the processing of sentences can be modeled as a sequence of merge operations, each of which is associated with a sudden increase in high-gamma power. The model of sentence processing that best fits the data is based on a left-corner parser that operates on phrases rather than words. Our results suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases. This is consistent with the idea that the brain is a hierarchical processor. The results also suggest that the brain may use a merge operation to build syntactic structures. Merge operations have been proposed by linguists to explain how the brain processes the structure of sentences.

The color of nectar is often used as a cue for pollinator attraction, but the mechanisms that underlie this process are poorly understood. We show that the red color of the nectar of the plant Nesocodon mauritianus is derived from a previously undescribed alkaloid, nesocodin. We identify three enzymes that are necessary or sufficient for the production of this compound. We also identify nesocodin in the red nectar of the hummingbird-visited Jaltomata herrerae and provide molecular evidence for convergent evolution of this trait. This work suggests that the red color of nectar is a highly favored trait and that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation. This work also provides a molecular basis for the study of the evolution of color in nectar. (Show more)"

This heterogeneity includes signals of genetic ancestry ranging from western Europe to East Asia. In addition, we show that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago. These findings indicate that complex demographic processes during the Early Medieval period may have contributed in an unexpected way to shape the modern European genetic landscape.

In this study, we developed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. We found that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This study provides a unique perspective on the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme and its implications for DNA replication.

In the hypothesized RNA world, before the evolution of proteins, genetic information was stored in RNA molecules that were replicated by ribozymes. In the laboratory, it is possible to evolve ribozymes that can replicate RNA, but it is not known whether such ribozymes can also synthesize functional RNA molecules. Here, we report the evolution of an RNA polymerase ribozyme that can synthesize a variety of functional RNA molecules, including aptamers, ribozymes, and even tRNA. This polymerase can replicate RNA, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins.

The Black and Latino populations are estimated to experience declines in life expectancy at birth of 2.10 and 3.05 y, respectively, both of which are several times the 0.68-y reduction for Whites. Latinos, who have consistently experienced lower mortality than Whites (a phenomenon known as the Latino or Hispanic paradox), would see their more than 3-y survival advantage reduced to less than 1 y. These projections imply an increase of nearly 40% in the Black−White life expectancy gap, from 3.6 y to over 5 y, thereby eliminating progress made in reducing this differential since 2006.

We show that the transition to parasitic lifestyle, characterized by the parasite’s dependence on a host to fulfill its life cycle, rather than the loss of photosynthesis, is the main driver of the molecular evolution of plastid genomes. Our findings suggest that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that behavioral inflexibility resulted from the inability to forget. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a molecular mechanism for autism and suggests a potential target for treatment. This study also provides a framework for identifying the converging functions of other genes in the brain. This framework can be extended to other complex diseases. (PsycINFO Database Record"

However, the mechanisms that facilitate virus spillover from bats to other animals and humans are largely unknown. Here, we identified and characterized a protein that is highly concentrated in the submandibular salivary gland of the bat, Myotis pilosus. This protein, named MTX, selectively inhibits the epoxide hydrolase function of leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) to inhibit LTA4 hydrolysis and the generation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a potent lipid chemoattractant for host defense against infection. MTX potently inhibited proinflammatory proteases to induce immune tolerance and maintain high stability. In mouse models, influenza A virus (IAV) infection and pathogenicity were exacerbated by MTX but were reversed by interfering with the effects of MTX on LTA4H or exogenous LTB4 administration. This study provides deeper insight into immunologically privileged sites for microbial community residence in bats and supports the therapeutic potential of targeting MTX-LTA4H.

The challenge is to assess the strength of the associations that we have found. This is a challenge that is becoming more important in the era of big data. We describe some recent developments in selective inference that can help us to address this challenge. We illustrate the use of these developments in forward stepwise regression, the lasso, and principal components analysis."

We demonstrate that the zebrafish genome contains three genes that encode ligands for Alk and Ltk. We show that these ligands are essential for the development of the pigment system in the eye and the skin. These experiments establish a physiological link between augmentor ligands and Ltk and demonstrate that particular augmentors activate Ltk in a tissue-specific context to induce iridophore differentiation from neural crest-derived cells and pigment progenitor cells.

Although climate change has likely enabled a portion of the increase in wildfire activity, the direct role of people in increasing wildfire activity has been largely overlooked. We evaluate government records of wildfires that were extinguished or managed by state or federal agencies from 1992 to 2012, and examined geographic and seasonal extents of human-ignited wildfires relative to lightning-ignited wildfires. Humans have vastly expanded the spatial and seasonal “fire niche” in the United States, accounting for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. During the 21-y time period, the human-caused fire season was three times longer than the lightning-caused fire season and added an average of 40,000 wildfires per year across the United States. Human-started wildfires disproportionally occurred where fuel moisture was higher than lightning-started fires, thereby helping expand the geographic and seasonal niche of wildfire.

Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods.

Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. This article is protected by copyright.

This profile is highly variable among different tomato species, and the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we report the discovery of a gene essential for the production of all the detectable nitrogenous volatiles in tomato fruit. This gene encodes a flavin-dependent monooxygenase that catalyzes sequential hydroxylations of a single precursor, 2-isobutyl-tetrahydrothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid. This pathway is unique to tomato and likely contributes to the distinctive flavor of this species. Understanding the mechanisms of tomato fruit flavor will be critical for the development of improved cultivars. (Read more)"

We demonstrate that striatonigral fibers originating in striosomes form highly unusual bouquet-like arborizations that target bundles of ventrally extending dopamine-containing dendrites and clusters of their parent nigral cell bodies. These clustered cell bodies in turn project to the striatum as part of the classic nigrostriatal pathway. Thus, these striosome–dendron bouquets likely represent subsystems with the nigro–striato–nigral loop that are affected in human disorders including Parkinson’s disease. Given evidence that striosomes receive input from cortical regions related to the control of mood and motivation and that they link functionally to reinforcement and decision-making, the striosome–dendron bouquets could be critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease. This study provides a unique view of the organization of the dopamine-containing nigral system. It also suggests that the striosome–dendron bouquets are likely to be important for the function of dopamine in the brain. This work may help to explain the role of dopamine in health and disease."

But how do we know when two people are connected? We asked pairs of friends and strangers to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Finally, we demonstrate that this signal is used by third-party listeners as a heuristic of how well people are connected: Conversations with faster response times were perceived as more connected than the same conversations with slower response times. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

This potential is important because it allows the heart to maintain a constant heart rate, even when the brain or other parts of the body are sending signals to change the heart rate. In this study, we show that the activity of the SAN is regulated by the activity of the SAN itself. This is important because it suggests that the SAN is not just a simple pacemaker, but also a complex and dynamic system that is constantly adapting to changing conditions in the body.

Thus, they have evolved a number of defense mechanisms to protect themselves from pathogens and other threats. One of the most important defense mechanisms is the production of defense-related molecules, which are often toxic to the plant itself. To avoid this, plants have evolved a number of detoxification mechanisms, which are often expressed constitutively. This can be a problem for the plant, as the expression of these molecules can be toxic to the plant itself. In this work, we show that DNA nanostructures can be used to deliver molecules that can silence the expression of these molecules.

The results have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. The study also highlights the need for a more holistic approach to food and nutrition security that considers the role of natural landscapes such as forests in meeting nutrition goals. This is particularly important in low- and middle-income countries where forests are often the only source of food and nutrition security."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the discovery of a 100-"
