The structure of ice II hydrate is of great interest because it is the first example of a hydrate with a noncubic structure. In this work, we report the synthesis and in situ neutron diffraction study of neon hydrate at high pressure and temperature. The structure of neon hydrate is found to be ice II-like, which is the first example of a hydrate with a noncubic structure. The results provide a new route to study the structure of ice II hydrate and other hydrates with noncubic structures.

The most prominent reconstruction programs, those of von Neumann, Mackey, Jauch, Piron, Abramsky, and Coecke, all rely on a precise mathematical notion of quantum system. The most widely used notion is that of a C*-algebra, which is a generalization of the notion of a ring. However, the mathematical structure of C*-algebras is not fully understood. In this paper, we provide a purely categorical characterization of C*-algebras. This addresses a question about the mathematical foundations of quantum theory raised in reconstruction programs such as those of von Neumann, Mackey, Jauch, Piron, Abramsky, and Coecke. Our characterization is purely categorical and does not presuppose any analytical structure. It is based on a notion of Hilbert C*-bimodule, which is a generalization of the notion of Hilbert C*-module. The main theorem of the paper states that a C*-algebra is equivalent to the category of Hilbert C*-bimodules over itself. This resolves a long-standing question about the mathematical foundations of quantum theory. It also provides a new perspective on the relationship between C*-algebras and Hilbert"

Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we present the first comparative genomic analysis of two distantly related myxozoan species, Kudoa iwatai and Myxobolus cerebralis, and compare these to the transcriptome and genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results show that myxozoans are cnidarians and are a sister taxon to the protostome group, and suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. These results provide insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic"

The disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which encodes several proteins that are able to antagonize the antiviral immune response. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes. We found that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a molecular"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. Sperm cells are quiescent in the male reproductive system due to Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1 channels, but become active once introduced into the low-Zn2+-concentration environment of the female reproductive tract. How Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide"

We quantify how the variability of maize yields will change in the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. We find that the probability of simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year increases from 0% to 7% under 2 °C warming and to 86% under 4 °C warming. These results highlight the need for investments in breeding for heat tolerance. They also underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammalian herbivore species in semiarid African savanna. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers. Grass consumption inferred from DNA sequences was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of grass consumption, indicating that DNA metabarcoding can be used to quantify diet breadth and composition. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages. Our findings highlight the importance of diet composition and composition overlap in determining trophic interactions. This study also demonstrates the utility of DNA metabarcoding for quantifying diet breadth and composition in large herbivore assemblages.

Many small businesses are financially fragile, with only about 2 wk of cash on hand at the time of the survey. We also find that many small businesses plan to apply for the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act loans, but anticipate problems with accessing the program. We use experimental variation to assess the take-up rates and business resilience effects of the CARES Act loans relative to grants-based programs.

However, the magnitude and the fate of this pollution are still open questions. Using data from the Malaspina 2010 circumnavigation, regional surveys, and previously published reports, we show a worldwide distribution of plastic on the surface of the open ocean, mostly accumulating in the convergence zones of each of the five subtropical gyres with comparable density. However, the global load of plastic on the open ocean surface was estimated to be on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This discrepancy is explained by the size distribution of floating plastic debris, which points at important size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean.

We found that the global fishing fleet doubled between 1950 and 2015—from 1.7 to 3.7 million vessels. This has been driven by substantial expansion of the motorized fleet, particularly, of the powered-artisanal fleet. By 2015, 68% of the global fishing fleet was motorized. Although the global fleet is dominated by small powered vessels under 50 kW, they contribute only 27% of the global engine power, which has increased from 25 to 145 GW. There are signs, however, of stabilization and more effective management in recent years, with a reduction in fleet sizes in developed countries. Based on historical patterns and allowing for the slowing rate of expansion, 1 million more motorized vessels could join the global fleet by midcentury as developing countries continue to transition away from subsistence fisheries. This will challenge sustainable use of fisheries' resources. We recommend that the global fishing fleet should be reduced to sustainable levels. This will require a global effort to improve data collection and monitoring, control, and surveillance. It will"

In humans, the average woman has 100–150 children in her lifetime. In contrast, the average human female has only one or two children. This dramatic difference is due to the fact that humans practice allonursing, a form of maternal care in which the mother nurses her offspring. Allonursing is practiced by only a few species of mammals, including elephants, whales, and dolphins. Here, we show that allonursing is associated with increased reproductive output. This suggests that the ultimate factor limiting reproductive output in placental mammals is maternal metabolic power rather than resource availability. Our results have implications for understanding the evolution of allonursing and the evolution of human reproductive output.

The endothelium controls vascular contractility, hemostasis, and inflammation and regulates the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products between circulating blood and tissue. To control each function, the endothelium processes endlessly arriving requests from multiple sources using separate clusters of cells specialized to detect specific stimuli. A well-developed but poorly understood communication system operates between cells to integrate multiple lines of information and coordinate endothelial responses. Here, the nature of the communication network has been addressed using single-cell Ca2+ imaging across thousands of endothelial cells in intact blood vessels. Cell activities were cross-correlated and compared to a stochastic model to determine network connections. Highly correlated Ca2+ activities occurred in scattered cell clusters, and network communication links between them exhibited unexpectedly short path lengths. The number of connections between cells (degree distribution) followed a power-law relationship revealing a scale-free network topology. The path length and degree distribution revealed an endothelial network with a “small-world” configuration.

A Threonine to Alanine substitution at this position was studied in three representative members of the K+-channel family. Interestingly, all of the mutant channels exhibited lack of C-type inactivation gating and an inversion of their allosteric coupling (i.e., closing of the activation gate collapses the channel’s selectivity filter). A state-dependent crystallographic study of KcsA-T75A proves that, on activation, the selectivity filter transitions from a nonconductive and deep C-type inactivated conformation to a conductive one. Finally, we provide a crystallographic demonstration that closed-state inactivation can be achieved by the structural collapse of the channel’s selectivity filter.

Here, we investigate the potential of anaerobic fungi to synthesize natural products that could regulate membership within the gut microbiome. We identify 146 genes that encode biosynthetic enzymes for diverse types of natural products, including nonribosomal peptide synthetases and polyketide synthases. We also identify seven putative bacteriocins, a class of antimicrobial peptides typically produced by bacteria. These results support the finding that anaerobic fungi synthesize natural products, which could be harnessed as a source of antimicrobials, therapeutics, and other bioactive compounds.

High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low-anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as decreased ATP and increased ROS production in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals. We conclude that mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens is crucial for social behavior and point to mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens as a potential marker and avenue of treatment for anxiety-"

However, the use of a single material phase and heuristically developed structural patterns leads to restricted design space and potential failure to achieve specific target behaviors. Here, through a free-form inverse design approach, multiple hyperelastic materials with distinct properties are optimally synthesized into composite structures to precisely achieve arbitrary and extreme prescribed responses under large deformations. The digitally synthesized structures exhibit organic shapes and motions with irregular distributions of material phases. Within the structures, different materials play distinct roles yet seamlessly collaborate through sophisticated deformation mechanisms to produce the target behaviors. While complex in geometry and material heterogeneity, the discovered structures are effectively manufactured via multimaterial fabrication with different polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomers with distinct behaviors and their highly nonlinear responses are physically and accurately realized in experiments. To enhance programmability, the synthesized structures are heteroassembled into architectures that exhibit highly complex yet navigable responses. The proposed synthesis, multimaterial fabrication, and heteroassembly strategy can be utilized to design function-oriented and situation-specific mechanical devices for a wide range of applications. We believe that the proposed approach will inspire the design of multifunctional mechanical devices with programmable"

The Hb system is regulated by the Hb regulatory proteins, including the insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1). Here we show that IGF2BP1 is expressed in human erythroid tissues and that its expression is developmentally regulated. We demonstrate that IGF2BP1 can reprogram the Hb expression pattern in human erythroid cells. This Hb reprogramming is mediated by reduced protein expression of the Hb regulatory protein BCL11A. These results suggest a mechanism for chronoregulation of Hb expression in humans. This mechanism may be relevant for the Hb phenotype observed in patients with the genetic disorder hemoglobin Bart’s hydrops. The Hb phenotype in this disorder is associated with a developmental delay of erythropoiesis.

This resistance is mediated by the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis, which activates sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. Here, we show that SREBP1-dependent lipogenesis protects cancer cells from ferroptosis. We also show that SREBP1-mediated ferroptosis resistance can be overcome by mTORC1 inhibition, and that combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction is effective in preclinical models of cancer. These findings suggest that ferroptosis induction may be a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer patients with PI3K-mutated or PTEN-defective tumors. This strategy may be particularly effective in combination with immune checkpoint blockade. Further preclinical and clinical studies are needed to test this hypothesis. This study also highlights the importance of lipid metabolism in cancer cell survival and death. This is particularly relevant in the context of the current focus on the role of lipid metabolism in metabolic reprogramming in cancer. The findings of this study also suggest"

The major drug class for treating hypertension is L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs), which are associated with increased risk of heart failure. We show that LCCBs activate Ca2+ signaling pathways that promote vascular remodeling. LCCBs act on the STIM N terminus to cause STIM relocalization to junctions and subsequent ORAI activation in a Cav1.2-independent and store depletion-independent manner. LCCB-induced promotion of VSMC remodeling requires STIM1, which is up-regulated in VSMCs from hypertensive rats. Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. Our findings unravel a mechanism of LCCBs action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. This study provides a rationale for the use of LCCBs in the treatment of hypertension.

We used &gt;25 years of bird surveys to test whether the NWFP stabilized populations of older-forest–associated birds and declined populations of early-seral–associated birds. We found that bird populations tracked changes in forest composition, but against our expectations, declines of older-forest–associated birds accelerated. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure. The NWFP is a model for how science-based policies can improve forest management and biodiversity conservation. We hope that our findings will inform the ongoing debate about the future of the NWFP. This is an important step toward understanding the influence of policy on biodiversity. We need to continue to monitor bird populations to evaluate the effectiveness of policy and to detect early signs of failure. We also need to continue to monitor forest composition to ensure that the policy is not failing to protect older forests. Finally, we need to continue to monitor the effects"

This problem can be addressed by the development of new antibacterial agents to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. Computational approaches are essential tools to this end since their application enables fast and early strategical decisions in the drug development process. We present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. This work provides a proof-of-concept for the rational design of new antibiotics. The approach presented here can be extended to other antibiotic classes.

However, in contrast to congenital deficiency, this was not fatal. CTLA-4 deletion induced preferential expansion of CTLA-4+ Treg cells.

We used a comprehensive dataset of 154 beetle genomes and transcriptomes to trace the evolution of beetle genes enabling symbiont-independent digestion of lignocellulose. Phylogenomic analyses of these uniquely comprehensive datasets resolved previously controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, plant cell wall-degrading enzymes obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, both major independent origins of specialized herbivory in beetles coincide with the first appearances of an arsenal of PCWDEs encoded in their genomes. Beetle diversity thus appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding PCWDEs.

These findings suggest that the brain’s reactivity to DA stimulation might contribute to the negative emotionality and addictive behaviors associated with marijuana abuse. The attenuated responses to MP, including reduced decreases in striatal dopamine, are consistent with decreased brain reactivity to the DA stimulation in marijuana abusers that might contribute to their negative emotionality and addictive behaviors.

They also suggest that the brain’s reactivity to DA stimulation might be a useful biomarker for predicting marijuana abuse and relapse. This study also provides a rationale for the use of methylphenidate as a drug to treat marijuana abuse. The findings suggest that methylphenidate might be a useful treatment for marijuana abuse.

Here, we show that the most powerful artificial neural networks for language processing also predict nearly all of the explainable variance in the brain’s neural responses to language when trained on data from multiple datasets and multiple imaging modalities. Models’ neural fits and fits to behavioral responses are both correlated with their accuracy on the language comprehension task. These results provide computational evidence that predictive processing fundamentally shapes the language comprehension mechanisms in the human brain. They also suggest that the brain may use predictive processing to optimize language comprehension.

However, it is still unclear whether DL can be used in scientific computing, where the accuracy of the solution is critical. We study this question by introducing a new theory of stability for neural networks. We prove that there are well-conditioned problems in scientific computing where one can prove the existence of stable neural networks, but there does not exist any algorithm that can train (or compute) such a neural network. This result implies a classification theory of stability, which we use to prove that only a few layers are needed for an ϵ-accurate solution to the inverse problem.

The disease is curable with multidrug therapy, but the disease is still prevalent in some parts of the world. Mycobacterium leprae has undergone extensive reductive evolution, and the disease is caused by a single-celled, mycobacterial pathogen that has lost many of the metabolic functions required to survive in the human body. Mycobacterium lepromatosis is a recently described human pathogen that is associated with a reactional state known as Lucio’s phenomenon. We sequenced the genome of M. lepromatosis from a patient with diffuse lepromatous leprosy and compared it with that of M. leprae. We found that M. lepromatosis has retained the ability to infect the peripheral nervous system, and that the two leprosy bacilli are remarkably conserved and still cause similar pathologic conditions. Our findings suggest that the two leprosy bacilli are still closely related and may be able to revert to a more virulent state in the future. This may be important for the development of a vaccine against leprosy. This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (R"

Recently, the study of quantum quenches revealed that these concepts are intricately intertwined. Although the unitary time evolution ensuing from a pure state maintains the system at zero entropy, local properties at long times are captured by a statistical ensemble with nonzero thermodynamic entropy, which is the entanglement accumulated during the dynamics. Therefore, understanding the entanglement evolution unveils how thermodynamics emerges in isolated systems. Alas, an exact computation of the entanglement dynamics was available so far only for noninteracting systems, whereas it was deemed unfeasible for interacting ones. Here, we show that the standard quasiparticle picture of the entanglement evolution, complemented with integrability-based knowledge of the steady state and its excitations, leads to a complete understanding of the entanglement dynamics in the space–time scaling limit. We thoroughly check our result for the paradigmatic Heisenberg chain. We also show that the entanglement dynamics in the space–time scaling limit is universal, in the sense that it is independent of the microscopic details of the initial state. This is a major step toward the understanding of the emergence of thermodynamics in isolated quantum systems. This work is a major step toward the understanding of the"

In addition, the furin cleavage site within the spike protein was deleted from the viral genome for added safety of the vaccine strain. In hamsters, COVI-VAC vaccination reduced lung viral loads and protected against all SARS-CoV-2–associated weight loss.

The vector of plague during this period is unknown. We developed a compartmental model for plague transmission by a human ectoparasite vector. Using Bayesian inference, we found that this model fits mortality curves from nine outbreaks in Europe better than models for rodent or pneumonic transmission. Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346–1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats. This study also provides a framework for understanding the role of human ectoparasites in the spread of other diseases. Future studies should test the model and its predictions in laboratory experiments and field studies. This would help to understand the potential impact of human ectoparasites on the spread of infectious diseases in the past and today. This is important because ectoparasites are increasingly being used as biological control agents to control vector-borne diseases. However, the potential impact of ectoparasites on the spread of infectious diseases is often not considered. Our model can help to quantify this impact."

However, this approach is biased because brain size is not the fundamental unit of brain computation. We present a new approach to study the evolution of brain capacity by directly analyzing the number of neurons. We show that reptiles have not only small brains relative to body size but also low neuronal densities, resulting in average neuron numbers over 20 times lower than those in birds and mammals of similar body size. Amniote brain evolution is characterized by the following four major shifts in neuron–brain scaling. The most dramatic increases in brain neurons occurred independently with the appearance of birds and mammals, resulting in convergent neuron scaling in the two endothermic lineages. The other two major increases in the number of neurons happened in core land birds and anthropoid primates, which are two groups known for their cognitive prowess. Interestingly, relative brain size is associated with relative neuronal cell density in reptiles, birds, and primates but not in other mammals. This has important implications for studies using relative brain size as a proxy when looking for evolutionary drivers of animal cognition.

However, current inhibitors cannot distinguish between TRAP1 and HSP90, the target of the clinically approved drug, geldanamycin. We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This study provides a mechanistic explanation for the anticancer activity of TRAP1 inhibitors and suggests that TRAP1 may be a useful target for cancer therapy.

It does so by binding to actin filaments and severing them. However, how it does so in a physiological context, where filaments are interconnected and under mechanical stress, remains unclear. Here, we monitor and quantify the action of ADF in different mechanical situations by using single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques, coupled to microfluidics. We find that local curvature favors severing, while tension surprisingly has no effect on ADF binding and weakly enhances severing. Remarkably, we observe that filament segments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist, experience a mechanical torque upon ADF binding. We find that this ADF-induced torque increases the severing rate constant 100-fold. A consequence of this mechanism is that cross-linked filament networks are severed by ADF far more efficiently than nonconnected filaments. We propose that this mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. This mechanism may be important for understanding actin dynamics in cells. It may also be relevant to understanding other processes that involve the severing of"

These findings suggest that fructose may be a weaker suppressor of appetite than glucose. The observed effects were not due to differences in glucose metabolism or insulin levels. These findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms of obesity and diabetes.

We find a common Bantu and Austronesian descent for all Malagasy individuals with a limited paternal contribution from Europe and the Middle East. Admixture and demographic growth happened recently, suggesting a rapid settlement of Madagascar during the last millennium.

We use a comparative approach to test the hypothesis that aquatic mammals are driven toward a size attractor by the energetic demands of the aquatic environment. We find that the evolution of an aquatic lifestyle is driving three of the four extant aquatic mammal clades toward a size attractor at ∼500 kg. The existence of this body size attractor and the relatively rapid selection toward, and limited deviation from, this attractor rule out most hypothesized drivers of size increase. These three independent body size increases and a shared aquatic optimum size are consistent with control by differences in the scaling of energetic intake and cost functions with body size between the terrestrial and aquatic realms. Under this energetic model, thermoregulatory costs constrain minimum size, whereas limitations on feeding efficiency constrain maximum size. Rather than being released from size pressures, water-dwelling mammals are driven and confined to larger body sizes by the strict energetic demands of the aquatic medium. This model provides a mechanistic explanation for the evolution of body size in mammals and may have implications for the evolution of body size in other aquatic organisms.

We found that mouse airway cells infected with mouse-adapted rhinovirus exhibited a striking enrichment in expression of antiviral defense response genes at 37 °C relative to 33 °C. This correlated with significantly higher expression levels of type I and type III IFN genes and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) at 37 °C. Temperature-dependent IFN induction in response to rhinovirus was dependent on the MAVS protein, a key signaling adaptor of the RIG-I–like receptors (RLRs).

It is able to cause infections by producing a variety of virulence factors, including toxins, proteases, and biofilm-inducing molecules. Here we show that P. aeruginosa uses its type IV pili to sense surfaces and promote its virulence. We demonstrate that type IV pili are required for surface sensing, and that the pili-mediated surface sensing pathway is essential for the expression of a variety of virulence factors. The type IV pili-mediated surface sensing pathway is thus a new mechanism for P. aeruginosa to sense surfaces and promote its virulence. This mechanism may be important for understanding the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa infections. It may also provide a target for new antimicrobial strategies.

This paper studies the proliferation of large dams in developing countries and the importance of incorporating climate change into considerations of whether to build a dam along with some of the governance and compensation challenges.

The exact mechanisms underlying these pathologies are not fully understood, but it is clear that inflammation plays a significant role. In this study, we demonstrate that neurons are capable of producing a variety of proinflammatory factors, including cytokines and chemokines, in response to Aβ. These factors are capable of inducing microglial activation and migration to the site of Aβ deposition. We also show that the extent of neuron-derived inflammation correlates with the presence of Aβ plaques in amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic rats. Finally, we identify a region of the human brain that is vulnerable to Aβ deposition and neurofibrillary tangle formation. This study reveals that neurons are a significant source of inflammation in AD and may be a target for therapeutic intervention.

The results of our faunal analysis demonstrate that the Hellenistic (fourth–second centuries B.C.E.) site of Maresha, Israel, is the earliest site known today where economic exploitation of chickens was widely practiced. We base our claim on the exceptionally high frequency of chicken bones at that site, the majority of which belong to adult individuals, and on the observed 2:1 ratio of female to male bones. These results are supported further by an extensive survey of faunal remains from 234 sites in the Southern Levant, spanning more than three millennia, which shows a sharp increase in the frequency of chicken during the Hellenistic period. We further argue that the earliest secure evidence for economic exploitation of chickens in Europe dates to the first century B.C.E. and therefore is predated by the finds in the Southern Levant by at least a century. We suggest that the gradual acclimatization of chickens in the Southern Levant and its gradual integration into the local economy, the latter fully accomplished in the Hellenistic period, was a crucial step in the adoption of this species in European husbandry some 100 y later."

In bacteria, the predominant decapping enzyme ApaH is inactivated by the very conditions of disulfide stress that enable Np4-capped RNAs to accumulate to high levels. Here, we show that, in cells experiencing such stress, the pyrophosphohydrolase RppH assumes a leading role in decapping those transcripts, preferring them as substrates over their triphosphorylated and diphosphorylated counterparts. The unique manner in which capped substrates of this kind bind to the active site of RppH positions the δ-phosphate, rather than the β-phosphate, for hydrolytic attack, generating triphosphorylated RNA as the primary product of decapping. This deprotection step is required to produce the monophosphorylated 5′ terminus needed to stimulate rapid RNA degradation. The unconventional manner in which RppH recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for"

The isotopic record of the isotopic compositions (δ18O and δ30Si) of marine cherts suggests that Earth’s oceans cooled from 70 ± 15 °C in the Archean to the present ∼15 °C. However, uncertainties regarding oceanic isotopic compositions, diagenetic or metamorphic resetting of the isotopic record, and depositional environments have led to questions regarding the accuracy of this interpretation. We here present thermostability measurements of ancestral enzymes derived from light-requiring prokaryotic and eukaryotic phototrophs having widely separated fossil-based divergence ages. The ancestral environmental temperatures thereby determined for these photic-zone organisms––shown in modern taxa to correlate strongly with thermostability––are inferred to reflect ancient surface-environment paleotemperatures. Our results suggest that Earth’s surface temperature decreased over geological time from ∼65–80 °C in the Archean, a finding consistent both with previous isotope-based and protein reconstruction-based interpretations.

K+ channels commonly possess two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We induced C-type inactivation in BK channels and studied the relationship between activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery. We observed prominent slow C-type inactivation/recovery in BK channels by an extreme low concentration of extracellular K+ together with a Y294E/K/Q/S or Y279F mutation whose equivalent in Shaker channels (T449E/K/D/Q/S or W434F) caused a greatly accelerated rate of C-type inactivation or constitutive C-inactivation. C-type inactivation in most K+ channels occurs upon sustained membrane depolarization or channel opening and then recovers during hyperpolarized membrane potentials or channel closure. However, we found that the BK channel C-type inactivation occurred during hyperpolarized membrane potentials"

Here, we show that the malaria parasite’s erythrocyte-binding antigen, EBA175, alters the biophysical properties of the RBC membrane, increasing the cytoskeletal tension and reducing the bending modulus of the membrane. These changes in the RBC membrane are correlated with parasite invasion efficiency. This finding suggests that the malaria parasite primes the erythrocyte surface through its binding antigens, altering the biophysical nature of the target cell and thus reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion. This would constitute a major change in our concept of malaria parasite invasion, suggesting it is, in fact, a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces working together to facilitate entry. This work provides a new perspective on the malaria parasite’s invasion strategy and opens up the possibility of targeting the host cell biophysical properties to disrupt parasite invasion. This could be a major step forward in the development of new antimalarial drugs.

In temperate regions, seasonal influenza outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in ambient humidity. However, the impact of humidity on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the impact of ambient humidity on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome. They also suggest that dry air may be a modifiable risk factor for influenza virus infection. This may have important implications for the development of public health strategies to"

Whether and how the brain builds such structures, however, remains largely unknown. Here, we used intracranial recordings to investigate how left-hemispheric brain activity varies during the formation of phrase structures. We found that high-gamma power increased with each successive word in a sentence but decreased suddenly whenever words could be merged into a phrase. This merge operation was equally applied to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity. More superficial models of language, based solely on sequential transition probability over lexical and syntactic categories, only captured activity in the posterior middle temporal gyrus. Activity in superior temporal and inferior frontal cortices was consistent with a neural implementation of a bottom-up or left-corner parser. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases. This may be a crucial step in the brain’s efficient processing of language. The results have implications for our understanding of language acquisition and dyslexia.

Axin is a key component of the pathway that converts signals at the plasma membrane to signals inhibiting the degradation of β-catenin, leading to its accumulation and specific gene activation. We show here that the two forms of Axin, Axin1 and Axin2, are similar at the protein level and genetically redundant. We demonstrate that differential regulation of the two genes on the transcriptional and proteostatic level confers differential responsiveness that can be used in tissue-specific regulation. Such subtle features may distinguish other redundant gene pairs that are commonly found in vertebrates through gene knockout experiments.

Electrical or optogenetic stimulation of LH GABA neurons induces rapid vigorous eating in sated animals. This effect is blocked by dopamine receptor antagonists, suggesting that dopamine is involved. We show that stimulation-induced eating is dependent on a circuit involving LH GABA neurons that synapse onto dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Lesions of these neurons block eating induced by LH stimulation. This circuit may promote overeating and contribute to obesity. This work provides a characterization of brain circuitry that may promote overeating and contribute to obesity. It also provides a model for the study of the neural basis of overeating and obesity.

Here, we demonstrate that rhizopine, a signal produced by plants, can be used to control nitrogen fixation in bacteria. We have developed a genetic circuit that allows the control of nitrogen fixation in the presence of rhizopine, a signal that is produced by the plant and is known to be produced by barley. This work represents a key milestone toward the development of a synthetic plant-controlled symbiosis in which the bacteria fix N2 only when in contact with the desired host plant and are prevented from interaction with nontarget plant species.

We study a community monitoring program that facilitated transfer of early deforestation alerts from the Global Forest Watch network to indigenous communities in the Peruvian Amazon and trained and incentivized community members to patrol forests in response to those alerts. The results from our analysis suggest that the program reduced tree cover loss, but the estimated effects from the experiment are imprecise. Data from monitoring records and community surveys provide evidence about how the program may affect forest outcomes. Should our findings be replicated elsewhere, they imply that externally facilitated community-based monitoring protocols that combine remote-sensed early deforestation alerts with training and incentives for monitors could contribute to sustainable forest management. This approach could be particularly effective in remote, resource-poor areas where deforestation is most severe. Our findings have implications for the design of forest monitoring and conservation programs in the Amazon and beyond.

The auditory organs of these animals are extremely diverse in anatomy after hundreds of millions of years of evolution, yet they are all made up of cellular tissue and are morphologically part of the bodies of animals. Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. We find that the wispy, wheel-shaped orb web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to capture the sound-induced air particle movements that approach the maximum physical efficiency better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By sensing the motion of web threads, the spider remotely detects and localizes the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave, such as those emitted by approaching prey or predators. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,00"

We find that it can avoid an excess mortality rate of 3.61 (2.96–4.21) million per year from outdoor air pollution worldwide. This could be up to 5.55 (4.52–6.52) million per year by additionally controlling nonfossil anthropogenic sources. Globally, fossil-fuel-related emissions account for about 65% of the excess mortality, and 70% of the climate cooling by anthropogenic aerosols. The chemical influence of air pollution on aeolian dust contributes to the aerosol cooling. Since aerosols mask the anthropogenic rise in global temperature, removing fossil-fuel-generated particles liberates 0.51(±0.03) °C and all pollution particles 0.73(±0.03) °C warming, reaching around 2 °C over North America and Northeast Asia.

We also demonstrate that antibodies raised against the engineered RBD exhibit heterotypic binding to the RBD from two recently reported SARS-CoV-2 VOCs. Presentation of the engineered RBD on a designed VLP also reduced weight loss in hamsters upon viral challenge.

However, the management of annual cropping systems on grassland-derived Mollisols remains highly uncertain. We investigated how soil health management practices affected SOC storage and the distribution of SOC between particulate and mineral-associated fractions in a 29-y-old field experiment in the North Central United States. Compared to conventional continuous maize monocropping with annual tillage, systems with reduced tillage, diversified crop rotations with cover crops and legumes, or manure addition did not increase total SOC storage or mineral-associated SOC, whereas perennial pastures managed with rotational grazing accumulated more SOC and mineral-associated SOC (18 to 29% higher) than all annual cropping systems after 29 y of management.

We developed a risk ranking framework and interactive web tool, SpillOver, that estimates a risk score for wildlife-origin viruses, creating a comparative risk assessment of viruses with uncharacterized zoonotic spillover potential alongside those already known to be zoonotic. Using data from virus discovery and surveillance efforts, we ranked the spillover potential of 887 wildlife viruses. Validating the risk assessment, the top 12 were known zoonotic viruses. Several newly detected wildlife viruses ranked higher than known zoonotic viruses. The SpillOver platform can be used by policy makers and health scientists to inform research and public health interventions for prevention and rapid control of disease outbreaks. SpillOver is a living, interactive database that can be refined over time to continue to improve the quality and public availability of information on viral threats to human health. This work is a first step toward a more comprehensive understanding of the risk of spillover and spread of zoonotic viruses. We hope that SpillOver will be a useful tool"

One of the main rewards plants offer to pollinators for visitation is nectar. One of the most common colors of nectar is red, which is thought to be a visual attractant for pollinators. We show that the red color of Nesocodon mauritianus nectar is derived from a previously undescribed alkaloid, nesocodin. We also identify nesocodin in the red nectar of the distantly related and hummingbird-visited Jaltomata herrerae and provide molecular evidence for convergent evolution of this trait. This work cumulatively identifies a convergently evolved trait in two vertebrate-pollinated species, suggesting that the red pigment is selectively favored and that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation. This work also provides a molecular framework for the study of vertebrate-pollinated plants. This work is important for understanding the evolution of vertebrate-pollinated plants and the evolution of color in nectar. It also has implications for the study of vertebrate pollination and the evolution of color in plants. This work also provides a molecular framework for the study of vertebrate-pollinated plants.

The analysis of the 41 individuals, including 11 whole genomes, reveals a complex genetic history, including a high degree of female admixture from diverse geographic regions. In addition, we identified many variants associated with recent positive selection, indicating that the genetic landscape of modern Europeans was already shaped by the end of the Roman Empire. These findings suggest that complex demographic processes during the Early Medieval period may have contributed in an unexpected way to shape the modern European genetic landscape. The analysis of the female genomes also indicates that skull deformations were more common in the past than previously thought. This example of female-biased migration indicates that complex demographic processes during the Early Medieval period may have contributed in an unexpected way to shape the modern European genetic landscape. Examination of the panel of functional loci also revealed that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how HKU4 and HKU5 transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. First, whereas MERS-CoV prefers human DPP4 over bat DPP4 as its receptor, HKU4 shows the opposite trend. Second, in the absence of exogenous proteases, both MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes mediate pseudovirus entry into bat cells, whereas only MERS-CoV spike, but not HKU4 spike, mediates pseudovirus entry into human cells. Thus, MERS-CoV, but not HKU4, has adapted to"

We identified vector-borne, zoonotic, and emerging pathogens, including dengue virus, Plasmodium knowlesi, leptospirosis, and chikungunya virus. We also identified a high prevalence of HIV coinfection. Our findings suggest that coordinated and ongoing metagenomic sequencing of febrile persons can better identify the breadth of endemic, zoonotic, or emerging pathogens and deployment of rapid public health response. This approach can be used to investigate undifferentiated febrile illness in resource-scarce settings. This study was conducted in a periurban population in Cambodia.

The template for these fragments is the newly synthesized single-stranded DNA that is synthesized by DNA polymerase δ (pol δ). The template for the synthesis of the 3′ end of the Okazaki fragment is the 5′ end of the next Okazaki fragment. This creates a 3′ to 5′ directionality that requires a sliding clamp to allow the polymerase to move along the DNA template in the 3′ to 5′ direction. The sliding clamp is the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). The PCNA sliding clamp is a large protein that contains multiple domains. One of these domains is the PCNA-DNA binding domain that allows the PCNA sliding clamp to bind to the DNA template. The PCNA-DNA binding domain contains a number of amino acids that are conserved across species. We designed a series of experiments to test the stability of the PCNA-DNA binding domain. We found that the PCNA-DNA binding domain is very stable and that it maintains a loose association with the PCNA sliding clamp while replicating DNA. This has profound implications for the synthesis of

In the hypothesized RNA world, before the evolution of proteins, genetic information was stored in RNA molecules that were replicated by ribozymes. In an effort toward reconstructing RNA-based life in the laboratory, we used directed evolution to improve the activity of an RNA polymerase ribozyme. The improved polymerase can synthesize a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and, in low yield, even tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins. This work provides a proof of principle for the reconstruction of RNA-based life. It also provides a platform for the study of RNA-based life in the laboratory. The polymerase can be used to study the replication of RNA molecules, the evolution of RNA molecules, and the evolution of RNA-based life. The improved polymerase can also be"

We connect changes in the physical appearance of five US cities with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

The fungal xanthocillin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) encodes a family of isocyanide-containing metabolites that bind copper. Here we demonstrate that the xan BGC is expressed in A. fumigatus in response to copper limitation and that xan BGC isocyanides bind copper and impact cellular copper content. Copper-dependent antimicrobial properties of xan BGC isocyanides were demonstrated in coculture experiments with a variety of pathogenic fungi and bacteria. The existence of the xanthocillin BGC in several filamentous fungi suggests a heretofore unknown role of eukaryotic natural products in copper homeostasis and mediation of interactions with competing microbes. These findings provide insight into the role of fungal natural products in the regulation of metal homeostasis and the evolution of metal-dependent antimicrobial properties in fungi. They also suggest a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of fungal infections. This work also demonstrates the utility of the CAS assay for the detection of metal-binding natural products.

This comes from analysis of observations showing that stratospheric water vapor increases with tropospheric temperature, implying the existence of a stratospheric water vapor feedback. We estimate the strength of this feedback in a chemistry–climate model to be +0.3 W/(m2⋅K), which would be a significant contributor to the overall climate sensitivity. One-third of this feedback comes from increases in water vapor entering the stratosphere through the tropical tropopause layer, with the rest coming from increases in water vapor entering through the extratropical tropopause. This work provides a new perspective on the role of stratospheric water vapor in climate. It also provides a new perspective on the role of the tropical tropopause layer in climate.

In some species, these pigments are modified to form unusual colors. For example, the blue-green color of many frogs and toads is caused by the accumulation of biliverdin, a pigment that is normally found in the liver.

We report that hypoxia induces expression of AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), which demethylates N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications on messenger RNA (mRNA). ALKBH5 expression is induced by hypoxia through the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and HIF-2α pathways. ALKBH5 expression is required for the induction of breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) phenotype in response to hypoxia. ALKBH5-mediated m6A demethylation of NANOG mRNA increases NANOG mRNA levels, which in turn increases the percentage of BCSCs. Thus, ALKBH5-mediated m6A modification of NANOG mRNA is a HIF-dependent mechanism that promotes BCSC expansion in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Our findings suggest that targeting ALKBH5 may be a promising strategy for cancer therapy. This study also provides a mechanism for how the hypoxic tumor microenvironment promotes BCSC expansion.

The source of the parchment, often called “uterine vellum,” has been a long-standing controversy in codicology. Use of the Latin term abortivum in many sources has led some scholars to suggest that fetal calves or sheep skins were used. Others have argued that it would not be possible to sustain herds if so many pocket Bibles were produced from fetal skins, arguing instead for unexpected alternatives, such as rabbit. Here, we report a simple and objective method using standard conservation treatments to identify the animal origin of parchment. The noninvasive method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals; however, we did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides.

The extinction occurred between 251.941 ± 0.037 and 251.880 ± 0.031 Mya, an interval of 60 ± 48 ka. Onset of a major reorganization of the carbon cycle immediately precedes the initiation of extinction and is punctuated by a sharp (3‰), short-lived negative spike in the isotopic composition of carbonate carbon. Carbon cycle volatility persists for ∼500 ka before a return to near preextinction values. Decamillenial to millennial level resolution of the mass extinction and its aftermath will permit a refined evaluation of the relative roles of rate-dependent processes contributing to the extinction, allowing insight into postextinction ecosystem expansion."

RORαΔIEC mice exhibit excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs.

We find that for most elements, chemical hardness and electronegativity decrease with pressure, consistent with pressure-induced metallization. Furthermore, we discover that pressure-induced s-d orbital transfer makes Ni, Pd, and Pt “pseudo–noble-gas” atoms with a closed d-shell configuration, and the elements preceding them (Fe and, especially, Co, Rh, and Ir) electron acceptors, while the elements right after them (Cu, Ag, Zn, and Cd) become highly electropositive.

This pandemic is generally understood as the consequence of a singular introduction of Yersinia pestis, after which the disease established itself in European rodents over four centuries. To locate these putative plague reservoirs, we studied the climate fluctuations that preceded regional plague epidemics, based on a dataset of 7,711 georeferenced historical plague outbreaks and 15 annually resolved tree-ring records from Europe and Asia. We provide evidence for repeated climate-driven reintroductions of the bacterium into European harbors from reservoirs in Asia, with a delay of 15 ± 1 y.

We show here that monoclonal antibodies targeting IL1RAP have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action.

We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

However, their assessments are subjective and difficult to aggregate into a quantitative variable. We propose a method to convert the original categorical crop expert assessments into a continuous probabilistic variable that is better suited for quantitative analysis. We show that the resulting crop condition index is robust across different crops, exhibits long-term stability, and has nation-wide validity. We demonstrate how this index can be used to monitor crop status and provide earlier and more precise predictions of crop yields than official USDA forecasts released midseason. Our results show that the crop expert network can be used to provide a more accurate and timely assessment of crop status and yield potential. This can help farmers make better decisions and mitigate risks, and can also be used to monitor crop conditions and detect anomalies in real time. This approach can be extended to other countries and crops. Our results have implications for agricultural policy, disaster relief, and food security."

Here we propose a mechanism for memory that is based on the adaptive changes in excitability of neurons. This mechanism is sensitive to context and serial order which makes it suitable for temporal integration in sequence processing within the language domain. We show that this mechanism is sensitive to context and serial order which makes it suitable for temporal integration in sequence processing within the language domain. We also show that it enables the binding of linguistic features over time within dynamic memory registers. This work provides a step toward a computational neurobiology of language. We propose that memory is supported by intrinsic plasticity that downregulates neuronal firing rates. Single neuron responses are dependent on experience, and we show through simulations that these adaptive changes in excitability provide memory on timescales ranging from milliseconds to seconds. From these variables, information is continuously read back into the active membrane state for processing. This neuronal memory mechanism does not rely on persistent activity, excitatory feedback, or synaptic plasticity for storage. Instead, information is maintained in adaptive conductances that reduce firing rates and can be accessed directly without cued retrieval. Memory span is systematically related to both the time constant of adaptation and baseline"

We synthesize the largest global dataset to date of soil respiration, moisture, and temperature measurements, totaling &gt;3,800 observations representing 27 temperature manipulation studies, spanning nine biomes and over 2 decades of warming. Our analysis reveals no significant differences in the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration between control and warmed plots in all biomes, with the exception of deserts and boreal forests. Thus, our data provide limited evidence of acclimation of soil respiration to experimental warming in several major biome types, contrary to the results from multiple single-site studies. Our analysis adds a unique cross-biome perspective on the temperature response of soil respiration, information critical to improving our mechanistic understanding of how soil carbon dynamics change with climatic warming. Our results suggest that soil respiration may be more responsive to warming in colder climates compared with warmer regions. This may have important implications for the global carbon cycle, as soil respiration is a major source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. However, the lack of significant warming effects in many biomes suggests that soil respiration may be less responsive to warming than previously thought. This may"

The molecular mechanisms underlying this transition are still poorly understood. Here, we present a model of the trajectory of plastid genome evolution during the transition from autotrophy to a nonphotosynthetic parasitic lifestyle. We show that the loss of photosynthesis is linked to the establishment of a parasitic lifestyle, characterized by the parasite’s dependence on a host to fulfill its life cycle. Our findings suggest that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner. During the functional reduction process, the elevation of evolutionary rates reaches several new rate equilibria, possibly relating to the modified protein turnover rates in heterotrophic plastids. Our model provides a framework for understanding the molecular evolution of plastid genomes during the transition from autotrophy to a nonphotosynthetic parasitic lifestyle. It also provides a potential explanation for the molecular evolution of plastid genomes in the parasitic plant kingdom.

It represents the oldest extant anthropogenic quasicrystal currently known, with the distinctive property that its precise time of creation is indelibly etched in history. Like the naturally formed quasicrystals found in the Khatyrka meteorite and experimental shock syntheses of quasicrystals, the anthropogenic quasicrystals in red trinitite demonstrate that transient extreme pressure–temperature conditions are suitable for the synthesis of quasicrystals and for the discovery of new quasicrystal-forming systems.

This reaction is catalyzed by two unrelated cyclase enzymes using different chemistries. The majority of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria use O2-sensitive [4Fe-4S] cluster proteins, whereas plants, cyanobacteria, and some phototrophic bacteria possess an O2-dependent enzyme, the major catalytic component of which is a diiron protein.

However, the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms of ASK1 in neuroinflammation remain unknown. In this study, we generated conditional knockout (CKO) mice that lack ASK1 in T cells, dendritic cells, microglia/macrophages, microglia, or astrocytes. We found that ASK1 deficiency in microglia/macrophages and astrocytes ameliorated the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), whereas ASK1 deficiency in T cells and dendritic cells had no significant effects on EAE. We further found that ASK1 in microglia/macrophages induces a proinflammatory environment, which subsequently activates astrocytes to exacerbate neuroinflammation. Our findings suggest that ASK1 in microglia/macrophages plays a major role in generating and maintaining disease, whereas ASK1 in astrocytes plays a greater proinflammatory role in the later stage of EAE. These findings suggest that glial ASK1 is a promising therapeutic target for reducing neuroinflammation. This study provides a better understanding of"

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a molecular mechanism of autism-risk genes and a potential target for drug development. It also provides a general mechanism of behavioral flexibility, which is a core autistic symptom. This study is expected to facilitate the understanding of autism and to contribute to the development of a treatment for autism. This study also provides a molecular mechanism"

Montsechia is also the earliest known angiosperm with a complete fruit. Montsechia is Barremian in age, suggesting that aquatic plants were common at an early stage of angiosperm evolution. This opens the possibility that aquatic habitats may have played a major role in the diversification of some early angiosperm lineages. The study of Montsechia also raises questions about the position of the Ceratophyllum clade in the angiosperm tree of life.

The most recent common ancestor of all B19V has been dated to the early 1800s, and it has been suggested that genotype 1, the most common B19V genotype, only started circulating in the 1960s. Here we present 10 ancient B19V genomes (∼0.5–6.9 kya) from Eurasia and Greenland. Five of the ancient B19V sequences fall within or basal to the modern genotype 1, and five fall basal to genotype 2, showing a long-term association of B19V with humans. The most recent common ancestor of all B19V is placed ∼12.6 kya, and we find a substitution rate that is an order of magnitude lower than inferred previously. This study emphasizes the importance of ancient viral sequences for our understanding of virus evolution and phylogenetics. The oldest B19V genome is ∼0.5 kya, which is older than the oldest human genome. This suggests that"

We estimate that global mean sea level has risen at an average rate of 2.9 ± 0.4 mm/y over the last 25 y, which, when coupled with the observed rate of climate-change–driven sea level rise, implies that global mean sea level could rise 65 ± 12 cm by 2100 compared with 2005. This estimate is in agreement with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 5th Assessment Report (AR5) model projections. The quadratic trend analysis is a useful tool for estimating the rate of climate-change–driven sea level rise. However, the quadratic trend is not a linear function of time, and thus, the quadratic trend is not a direct estimate of the rate of sea level rise. We estimate the rate of sea level rise by fitting a linear function to the sea level time series. This method is more accurate than the quadratic trend analysis.

Here, we use NMR-assisted crystallography to characterize the structure and chemical dynamics of this intermediate. From this analysis, a detailed three-dimensional picture of structure and reactivity emerges, highlighting the fate of the L-serine hydroxyl leaving group and the reaction pathway back to the preceding transition state. Reaction of the α-aminoacrylate intermediate with benzimidazole, an isostere of the natural substrate indole, shows benzimidazole bound in the active site and poised for, but unable to initiate, the subsequent bond formation step. When modeled into the benzimidazole position, indole is positioned with C3 in contact with the α-aminoacrylate Cβ and aligned for nucleophilic attack. Here, the chemically detailed, three-dimensional structure from NMR-assisted crystallography is key to understanding why benzimidazole does not react, while indole does. This work demonstrates the power of NMR-assisted crystallography to provide mechanistic insight into enzyme catalysis. This approach is applicable to a wide range of enzymes and substrates,"

Prophylactic treatment initiated 24 h prior to inoculation completely prevented MERS-CoV−induced clinical disease, strongly inhibited MERS-CoV replication in respiratory tissues, and prevented the formation of lung lesions. Therapeutic treatment initiated 12 h postinoculation also provided a clear clinical benefit, with a reduction in clinical signs, reduced virus replication in the lungs, and decreased presence and severity of lung lesions.

We also show that the catabolism of this glycan by the symbionts is required for the acidification of the symbiotic epithelium, which enhances the luminescence of the symbiont. These results suggest that the provision of specific nutrients to the epithelium of the symbiotic organ may be a general strategy used by animals to maintain the health of their symbionts.

This intervention halved suspension rates from 9.6% to 4.8% in five middle schools. It also bolstered respect the most at-risk students, previously suspended students, perceived from teachers.

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis remain unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We found that pol II stalling at O2-EtdT and N3-EtdT sites is exacerbated by TFIIS-stimulated proofreading activity. Assessment for the impact of the EtdT lesions on individual fidelity checkpoints provided further mechanistic insights, where the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into endosomes."

Here we apply quantitative proteomics of N-linked glycoproteins to reveal how a collection of some 700 surface proteins is dramatically remodeled in an isogenic breast epithelial cell line stably expressing any of six of the most prominent proliferative oncogenes, including the receptor tyrosine kinases, EGFR and HER2, and downstream signaling partners such as KRAS, BRAF, MEK, and AKT. We find that each oncogene has somewhat different surfaceomes, but the functions of these proteins are harmonized by common biological themes including up-regulation of nutrient transporters, down-regulation of adhesion molecules and tumor suppressing phosphatases, and alteration in immune modulators. Addition of a potent MEK inhibitor that blocks MAPK signaling brings each oncogene-induced surfaceome back to a common state reflecting the strong dependence of the oncogene on the MAPK pathway to propagate signaling.

Therefore, the generation of ECs is a critical step for the development of vascular regeneration. However, the generation of ECs from nonvascular cells has been a challenge. Here, we demonstrate that ets variant 2 (ETV2) alone can directly convert primary human adult skin fibroblasts into functional vascular endothelial cells (ETVECs). In coordination with endogenous FOXC2 in fibroblasts, transduced ETV2 elicits expression of multiple key endothelial development factors, including FLI1, ERG, and TAL1, and induces expression of endothelial functional molecules, including EGFL7 and von Willebrand factor. Consequently, ETVECs exhibits EC characteristics in vitro and forms mature functional vasculature in Matrigel plugs transplanted in NOD SCID mice. Furthermore, ETVECs significantly improve blood flow recovery in a hind limb ischemic model using BALB/c-nu mice.

Accumulating evidence indicates that stimulator of interferon genes (STING) plays an important role in regulating insulin sensitivity. However, its function in β-cells remains unknown. Herein, using global STING knockout (STING−/−) and β-cell–specific STING knockout (STING-βKO) mouse models, we revealed a distinct role of STING in the regulation of glucose homeostasis through peripheral tissues and β-cells. Specially, although STING−/− beneficially alleviated insulin resistance and glucose intolerance induced by high-fat diet, it surprisingly impaired islet glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Importantly, STING-βKO caused glucose intolerance due to impaired GSIS, indicating that STING is required for normal β-cell function. Islet transcriptome analysis showed that STING deficiency decreased expression of β-cell function–related genes, including Glut2, Kcnj11, and Abcc8, contributing to impaired GSIS. Mechanistically, the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (AT"

The genome of the virus is segmented into eight fragments, which offers evolutionary advantages but complicates genomic packaging. The existence of a selective packaging mechanism, in which one copy of each viral RNA is specifically packaged into each virion, is suspected, but its molecular details remain unknown. Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus using in vitro experiments. We demonstrated that this interaction takes place in infected cells and is required for optimal viral replication. Disruption of this interaction did not affect the HA titer of the mutant viruses, suggesting that the same amount of viral particles was produced. However, it nonspecifically increased the amount of viral RNA in the viral particles, resulting in an eightfold increase in empty viral particles. These results indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions. The lack of conservation of these interactions might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses. This study provides a molecular understanding of the selective packaging mechanism of influenza A virus. This knowledge can be used to develop new"

However, human activities have greatly increased the spatial and seasonal extent of wildfire in the United States. Human-caused wildfires have become so common that they now account for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. Human-caused wildfires disproportionally occur in areas where fuel moisture is higher than lightning-caused fires, thereby helping expand the geographic and seasonal niche of wildfire. The expansion of the human fire niche has important implications for the economic and ecological costs of wildfire in the United States. Actions to raise awareness and increase management in regions prone to human-started wildfires should be a focus of United States policy to reduce fire risk and associated hazards. This work is a call to action to reduce the economic and ecological costs of wildfire in the United States.

We connect changes in the physical appearance of five US cities with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

However, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Here, we show that altered nutrient cycling during heat stress is a primary driver of the functional breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis. Heat stress increased the metabolic energy demand of the coral host, which was compensated by the catabolic degradation of amino acids. The resulting shift from net uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont subsequently promoted the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host. Energy limitation and altered symbiotic nutrient cycling are thus key factors in the early heat stress response, directly contributing to the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis. Interpreting the stability of the coral holobiont in light of its metabolic interactions provides a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

In all animals, the epithelium is maintained by a dynamic interaction with the microbiome. Here, we investigate the consequences of tumorigenesis on the microbiome using a Drosophila intestinal tumor model. We show that upon loss of BMP signaling, tumors lead to aberrant activation of JNK/Mmp2 signaling, followed by intestinal barrier dysfunction and commensal imbalance. In turn, the dysbiotic microbiome triggers a regenerative response and stimulates tumor growth. We find that inhibiting JNK signaling or depletion of the microbiome restores barrier function of the intestinal epithelium, leading to a reestablishment of host–microbe homeostasis, and organismic lifespan extension. Our experiments identify a JNK-dependent feedback amplification loop between intestinal tumors and the microbiome. They also highlight the importance of controlling the activity level of JNK signaling to maintain epithelial barrier function and host–microbe homeostasis. This work provides a mechanistic understanding of how intestinal tumors can alter the microbiome and how this in turn can promote tumor growth. It also provides a potential therapeutic target to control tumor growth by targeting JNK signaling. This work has implications for understanding the"

We examined whether epigenetic DNA methylation (DNA-me) alterations at specific loci in whole blood (WB) and blood monocytes (Monos) of people with diabetes are associated with metabolic memory. We found that DNA-me differences at certain loci in WB and Monos are associated with glycemia for several years during the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT). In vitro, high glucose induced similar persistent hypomethylation at thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) in cultured blood monocytes. These results support an epigenetic explanation for metabolic memory. Future studies are needed to determine whether epigenetic modifications at TXNIP are causally related to metabolic memory.

However, the role of FSIP1 in the progression and drug sensitivity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. Thus, our study provides a mechanistic understanding of the role of FSIP1 in TNBC and may"

The pathophysiology of alcohol dependence is complex and involves multiple brain systems. The gut–brain axis has been suggested to be involved in the development of alcohol dependence. However, the mechanisms and the biological parameters involved in the gut–brain axis are still unclear. In the present study, we found that some, but not all, alcohol-dependent subjects developed gut leakiness, which was associated with higher scores of depression, anxiety, and alcohol craving after 3 wk of abstinence. Moreover, subjects with increased gut permeability also had altered composition and activity of the gut microbiota. These results suggest the existence of a gut–brain axis in alcohol dependence, which implicates the gut microbiota as an actor in the gut barrier and in behavioral disorders. Thus, the gut microbiota seems to be a previously unidentified target in the management of alcohol dependence. This study provides a new perspective on the pathophysiology of alcohol dependence. It also suggests that the gut microbiota may be a promising target for the management of alcohol dependence. This hypothesis needs to be tested in future studies. © 2016 The Authors.

The fruit of the closely related species Solanum pennellii is nearly devoid of all nitrogenous volatiles, while the fruit of S. lycopersicum and S. pimpinellifolium accumulate high amounts. Using an introgression population derived from S. pennellii, we identified a locus essential for the production of all the detectable nitrogenous volatiles in tomato fruit. Silencing of the underlying gene in transgenic plants abolished production of aliphatic and aromatic nitrogenous volatiles in ripe fruit, and metabolomic analysis of these fruit revealed the accumulation of 2-isobutyl-tetrahydrothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid, a known conjugate of cysteine and 3-methylbutanal. Biosynthetic incorporation of stable isotope-labeled precursors into 2-isobutylthiazole and 2-phenylacetonitrile confirmed that cysteine provides the nitrogen atom for all nitrogenous volatiles in tomato fruit. This pathway is a major step forward in understanding and ultimately improving tomato flavor quality. This work also provides a proof-of-concept for the use of N-"

However, these threats are frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. Our findings have important implications for the design of conservation and restoration strategies. They also highlight the need to consider the combined effects of biodiversity loss and environmental warming in the design of mitigation and adaptation strategies. This is particularly important in the context of climate change, where the impacts of warming are likely to be more severe than those of biodiversity loss. Our results suggest that the impacts of climate change may be more severe than previously thought. Our results suggest that the impacts of climate change may be more severe than previously thought.

We found that grid cells, which encode the animal’s position in space, are strongly clustered, while border, head-direction, and object-vector cells are more diffusely distributed.

In this study, we show that the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) gene is not required for flowering of the host plant in a host–parasite interaction. Instead, FTs are able to move from the host to the parasite, where they physically interact with a dodder FD transcription factor to activate dodder flowering. This study demonstrates that FTs can function as an important interplant flowering signal in host–parasite interactions. The unique means of flowering regulation of dodder illustrates how regressive evolution, commonly found in parasites, may facilitate the physiological synchronization of parasite and host, here allowing the C. australis parasite to time reproduction exactly with that of their hosts, likely optimizing parasite fitness. This study also provides a new perspective on the evolution of flowering in plants. It is likely that the flowering of the host plant is not required for the flowering of the parasite, and that the flowering of the parasite is regulated by the host.

We demonstrate that striatonigral fibers originating in striosomes form highly unusual bouquet-like arborizations that target bundles of ventrally extending dopamine-containing dendrites and clusters of their parent nigral cell bodies. These clustered cell bodies in turn project to the striatum as part of the classic nigrostriatal pathway. Thus, these striosome–dendron bouquets likely represent subsystems with the nigro–striato–nigral loop that are affected in human disorders including Parkinson’s disease. Given evidence that striosomes receive input from cortical regions related to the control of mood and motivation and that they link functionally to reinforcement and decision-making, the striosome–dendron bouquets could be critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease. This study provides a unique view of the dopamine-containing nigral system. It also suggests that striosomes are involved in the control of movement and motivation.

For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Finally, we demonstrate that this signal is used by third-party listeners as a heuristic of how well people are connected: Conversations with faster response times were perceived as more connected than the same conversations with slower response times. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.” This work provides a new way to measure and understand social connection.

Here, we report that stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is selectively expressed in SANCs and is required for their Ca2+ store content and automaticity. STIM1 regulates Ca2+ dynamics in SANCs by modulating store-operated Ca2+ entry, which in turn influences the activity of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. These findings reveal that STIM1 is a multifunctional regulator of Ca2+ dynamics in SANCs that links SR Ca2+ store content with electrical events occurring in the plasma membrane, thereby contributing to automaticity of the SAN.

This mechanism is sensitive to context and serial order, and it enables the binding of linguistic features over time. This work provides a step toward a computational neurobiology of language. It also provides a mechanism for memory that is not reliant on persistent activity, excitatory feedback, or synaptic plasticity.

Nutrient inputs from small tributaries are often overlooked as a source of coastal eutrophication, despite their ubiquity and potential importance. We used a snapshot of nutrient inputs from nearly all tributaries of Lake Michigan to determine how land cover and dams alter nutrient inputs across watershed sizes. We found that the 6 largest tributaries of Lake Michigan accounted for ∼70% of the daily nitrogen and phosphorus delivered to the lake. However, small tributaries exhibited nutrient loads that were high for their size and biased toward dissolved inorganic forms. Higher bioavailability of nutrients from small watersheds suggests greater potential to fuel algal blooms in coastal areas. Our findings reveal an underappreciated role that small streams may play in driving coastal eutrophication in large water bodies. Expanding nutrient management efforts to address smaller watersheds could reduce the ecological impacts of nutrient loading on valuable nearshore ecosystems.

Our results provide insights into the Earth system response to abrupt global warming and help to understand the current rapid global warming. This work also highlights the importance of studying the carbon cycle in the context of global warming events. This is particularly important in light of the ongoing anthropogenic global warming. The carbon cycle response to anthropogenic warming is still under debate. Our results suggest that the carbon cycle response to anthropogenic warming may be similar to the response to natural global warming events.

We show that RSPO certification reduced tropical forest loss in Indonesia by 33% from 2001 to 2015. However, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results suggest that certification may be a useful tool for reducing deforestation in oil palm, but it is not a panacea. We also show that the RSPO’s certification system is not a good proxy for forest loss in oil palm plantations. We recommend that the RSPO develop a more accurate and transparent system for measuring forest loss in certified plantations. This would allow the RSPO to better inform its members and the public about the effectiveness of certification in reducing tropical deforestation. Our results also suggest that the RSPO’s certification system is not a good proxy for forest loss in oil palm plantations"

In humans, its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. Investigation of the dynamic regulation of the evolutionarily conserved exocyst-related processes using mutants in genetically tractable organisms such as Arabidopsis thaliana is limited by the lethality or the severity of phenotypes. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 (exocyst component of 70 kDa) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and offers a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease.

In many vertebrates, sex is determined by a single locus, which can be male- or female-determining. In species with multiple sex determination loci, sex is determined by a sex ratio-dependent mechanism, which is called polygenic sex determination (PSD). In this study, we investigate the effects of PSD on secondary sexual characteristics in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii, where one female-determining allele and one male-determining allele interact to produce siblings with four possible sex classes: females, males, intersexes, and hermaphrodites. We find that PSD in M. mbenjii produces an interplay of sex linkage and sex limitation resulting in modular variation in morphological and behavioral traits. The modularity of secondary sexual characteristics produced by PSD provides context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations. This study also demonstrates the utility of cichlid fish as a model system for studying the evolution of sex determination.

We show that intracellular iron levels impact the retina. In albino mice deficient in the protein that exports iron from the circulation, transferrin receptor, bisretinoid levels were reduced. In mice deficient in the proteins that export iron from the circulation, transferrin receptor, intracellular iron levels were increased. In contrast, in albino mice deficient in the protein that imports vitamin A, the accumulation of vitamin A aldehyde adducts, a precursor of bisretinoids, was elevated. These findings indicate that iron levels impact the retina. We also show that iron levels impact the oxidation and degradation of the bisretinoid A2E. In the presence of light, iron levels promote the oxidation and degradation of A2E. This is important because A2E is a precursor of bisretinoids. Thus, iron levels impact the retina and may contribute to the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration. This work also provides a mechanistic understanding of the role of iron in the photodegradation of A2E. This understanding may be useful in the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent or"

These tentacles are the only structures used for prey capture, and are therefore considered the “arms” of the siphonophore. Siphonophore tentacles are highly specialized, with each tentacle arm having a specific prey-capture function. This specialization is a key feature of siphonophores, and is thought to be an evolutionary dead end. Here we show that siphonophore tentacles have strong evolutionary associations with prey type, and that shifts between prey types are linked to shifts in the morphology, mode of evolution, and evolutionary correlations of tentacles and their nematocysts. Our findings help build a broader perspective on predatory niche diversification via morphological evolution. These findings contribute to understanding how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs. This work also helps to understand the evolution of the cnidarian nematocyst, which is the most primitive and complex toxin-delivery system in the animal kingdom. The nematocyst is a key component of the cnidarian predatory apparatus, and is responsible for the venom that is used to capture prey. The nematocyst is also the target of a number of biological"

The fossil record for the hominin lineage between 800,000 and 1.8 My old is relatively poor, and the oldest known hominin hand fossils are incomplete. We report the discovery of a nearly complete hominin hand from the Middle Pleistocene of East Africa. This fossil provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key derived characteristic of modern human and Neandertal hand morphology and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato. This fossil and its implications for hominin evolution are discussed. The fossil is named Australopithecus afarensis h. I (Ardipithecus ramidus), in honor of the late Dr. Ardi Pitrasteria.

We have developed a small-molecule inhibitor of the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), which converts serine to glycine and a folate-derived one-carbon unit. We show that SHMT inhibition is effective in colon cancer, and that a cancer cell-line screen reveals that B-cell lines are particularly sensitive to SHMT inhibition. We also show that formate, a substrate of the SHMT enzyme, rescues cells from SHMT inhibition, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. This effect is rooted in defective glycine import in DLBCL cell lines, rendering them uniquely dependent upon SHMT enzymatic activity to meet glycine demand. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of DLBCL. These results suggest that SHMT inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy for B-cell malignancies. This is the first report of a small-molecule inhibitor of SHMT. The inhibitor is orally bioavailable, and has low toxicity in normal cells. The cancer cell-line screen provides a resource for identifying additional targets of SHMT inhibition. The"

In this study, we show that deforestation can affect people’s diets and vitamin A status. We found that deforestation in rural Tanzania led to a reduction in fruit and vegetable consumption and thus vitamin A adequacy of diets. Conversely, we found that forest fragmentation led to an increase in fruit and vegetable consumption and dietary vitamin A adequacy. These findings have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. This study also highlights the need to consider the role of natural landscapes in meeting nutrition goals. This is particularly important in low- and middle-income countries where the majority of the world’s population lives. We show that forests can be important sources of fruit and vegetables and thus contribute to meeting nutrition goals. However, this requires that policies are in place to protect forests and that people are empowered to use these resources sustainably.

We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the recent discovery of a 150-m-long, 10-m-wide, and 2.5-m-deep"
