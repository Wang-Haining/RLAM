In this work, we report the structure of ice II hydrate, which is a new phase of water. The structure is determined by neutron diffraction and is found to be a hydrate with the same structure as that of the well-known hydrate, neon hydrate. The guest atoms are enclathrated in the water channels and have substantial freedom of movement. The structure of ice II hydrate is thermodynamically stable at high pressure and temperature. This work provides a new route to study the structure of ice II and opens up a new field of study for the study of hydrate structures. It also provides a new route to study the structure of ice II and opens up a new field of study for the study of hydrate structures. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

However, the extent to which species differ in their diets is largely unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa in the field. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species of large herbivores in semiarid African savanna. We found that the degree of overlap between species was greater between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption than between species that were dissimilar in these respects. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages, and that the diversity of large herbivores may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results have implications for the management of large herbivores in African savanna and elsewhere."

However, the magnitude and the fate of this pollution are still open questions. We show that the distribution of plastic debris in the open ocean is mostly related to the convergence zones of the five subtropical gyres, but the global load of plastic on the open ocean surface is far less than expected. This discrepancy is explained by the size distribution of plastic debris, which points at important size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

The communication system is a small-world network, which is a rare property that is associated with high efficiency in the transmission of information. The communication system is also scale-free, which means that the number of connections between cells is not evenly distributed. The communication system is effective in controlling vascular function and is the basis for the development of new therapies for cardiovascular diseases."

It is a promising material for applications in electronics, photonics, and quantum technologies. However, it is unclear how to control its electronic and optical properties. Here, we show that diamond can be metallized, and the bandgap can be reduced to zero, by applying strain. This opens up a new route to control the electronic and optical properties of diamond. We also show that diamond can be demetallized, and the bandgap can be restored, by applying tensile strain. This provides a route to control the phase transition from diamond to graphite. These findings offer opportunities for tailoring properties of diamond via strain engineering for electronic, photonic, and quantum applications.

In addition, HM was associated with less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia, but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors. The findings highlight the importance of psychological examinations of masculinity as a cultural ideology to understand how men’s and women’s endorsement of HM legitimizes patriarchal dominance and reinforces gender, race, and class-based hierarchies via candidate support.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a molecular mechanism for autism and may help in the development of treatments. (Show more)"

This glycan is delivered to the squid only at night, when the symbiotic organ is at its most active, and is catabolized by the symbionts to enhance their ability to produce light. This glycan-driven regulation of the symbiotic organ may be a general mechanism for the control of the activities of epithelial-associated microbial communities. This work provides a new perspective on the role of glycans in the immune system and in symbiosis. (Show more)"

At the same time, intensive fishing in regions where rivers are already degraded by other stressors may undermine efforts to conserve biodiversity.

We show that RSPO certification reduces deforestation in oil palm plantations, but that most plantations are too small to have a significant impact on deforestation. We also show that certification has no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection. Our results suggest that certification is not yet having the desired impact on deforestation, and that the RSPO needs to improve its standards to achieve its goals."

In humans, its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. In this study, we discovered a small molecule that inhibits the exocytosis process in both plant and human cells. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

In species with polygenic sex determination, multiple alleles interact to produce the sex of an individual. Here we show that the interaction of multiple alleles can produce a modular system of sexual dimorphism, where the same genotype can produce different phenotypes. This modularity can be used to understand the evolutionary causes and consequences of the maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles."

We show that the levels of iron in the retina, which is a site of accumulation of both molecules, impact the degradation of one of these molecules. This finding has implications for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in the elderly. (PsycINFO Database Record"

The fossil record for the evolution of the human hand is fragmentary, however, and the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key derived feature of the hand, the third metacarpal styloid process, is unknown. We report the discovery of this feature in a 1.42-Myr-old hand from Kenya, which provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of this feature and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo. This finding has implications for the evolution of the human hand and for the timing of the emergence of modern human behavior. (Show more)"

We have developed a small-molecule inhibitor of the one-carbon unit-generating enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase, and show that it blocks the growth of colon cancer xenografts. We also show that the one-carbon unit donor is a critical determinant of the sensitivity of cancer cell lines to the inhibitor, and that this sensitivity is rooted in defective glycine import. Thus, we have identified a metabolic vulnerability of cancer cells that can be targeted to block cell growth. This work provides a basis for the development of a new class of cancer therapeutics.

The results have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. The study also provides a framework for understanding the impact of deforestation on people’s diets, which can be used to inform future research and policy."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We also provide a global map of subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction."
