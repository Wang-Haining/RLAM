Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we compare the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This transition may have been facilitated by the loss of signaling pathways and transcriptional factors important for multicellular development. These results provide insight into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Show more)"

The virus responsible for this disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is able to evade the host innate immune response by blocking interferon (IFN)-induced nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 uses a viral accessory protein, Orf6, to block nuclear import of the IFN-induced transcription factors. We demonstrate that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. We also show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. Our findings unveil a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the host antiviral response and may help to design more effective antiviral strategies"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of proton channels, but the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels is not completely understood. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammals in semiarid African savanna. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers. Grass consumption inferred from DNA sequence relative read abundance ranged from &gt;99% (plains zebra) to &lt;1% (dik-dik). Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, dietary composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammal assemblages, and that large mammal diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This study demonstrates the utility of DNA metabarcoding for quantifying diet breadth, composition, and overlap, and for identifying species-level differences in diet.

This discrepancy is explained by the selective removal of small plastic fragments by the ocean interior. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered.

There are signs, however, of stabilization and more effective management in recent years, with a reduction in fleet sizes in developed countries. The global fleet could double again by midcentury, as developing countries continue to transition away from subsistence fisheries. This would challenge sustainable use of fisheries' resources. The expansion of the motorized fleet has been driven by the powered-artisanal fleet, which has grown substantially in recent decades.

A Threonine to Alanine substitution at this position was studied in three representative members of the K+-channel family. Interestingly, all of the mutant channels exhibited lack of C-type inactivation gating and an inversion of their allosteric coupling (i.e., closing of the activation gate collapses the channel’s selectivity filter). A state-dependent crystallographic study of KcsA-T75A proves that, on activation, the selectivity filter transitions from a nonconductive and deep C-type inactivated conformation to a conductive one.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here we show that anxiety influences social dominance in male outbred rats and identify an important mediating role for mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens. High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low-anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as decreased ATP and increased reactive oxygen species production in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious individuals. We conclude that mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens is crucial for social behavior and is critically involved in the low social competitiveness associated with high anxiety.

The hemoglobin gene family in humans is composed of four globin genes, alpha (α), beta (β), delta (δ), and gamma (γ), each of which is expressed in different tissues. The hemoglobin genes are expressed in a developmental order, with the fetal genes (δ and γ) expressed first, followed by the adult genes (α and β). The expression of fetal hemoglobin is associated with a number of benefits, including increased resistance to oxidative stress and a higher oxygen-carrying capacity. The mechanisms that control the developmental expression of hemoglobin are not well understood. Here we demonstrate that a gene, insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1), is expressed in erythroid tissues and that its expression is developmentally regulated. We show that IGF2BP1 can reprogram the hemoglobin expression pattern in erythroid cells. This suggests that IGF2BP1 may be involved in the control of hemoglobin expression in humans. This study provides a potential mechanism for chronoregulation of fetal and adult hemoglobin expression in humans. (Show more)"

Despite recent advances in cancer treatment, the majority of patients do not respond to therapy. One of the main reasons for this failure is the emergence of cancer resistance to treatment. In this study, we found that cancer cells with mutations in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway are resistant to ferroptosis, a form of regulated necrosis driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. We also found that this resistance is mediated by the activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. Finally, we demonstrated that the combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction is effective in preclinical models of cancer. These results suggest that ferroptosis may be a promising target for cancer treatment. (Show more)"

The major drug class for treating hypertension is L-type Ca2+ channel (Cav1.2) blockers (LCCBs). LCCBs are associated with heart failure in patients. We show that LCCBs activate a store-operated Ca2+ entry pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which is mediated by the Ca2+ sensor protein STIM. LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of plasma membrane ORAI channels. Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. Our findings unravel a mechanism of LCCBs action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. This mechanism may explain the association of LCCBs with heart failure in patients. Our findings may help to improve the safety of LCCBs in patients.

The network architecture is based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice.

However, in contrast to congenital deficiency, this was not fatal. CTLA-4 deletion induced preferential expansion of CTLA-4–negative Treg cells. However, T cells from CTLA-4–deficient inducible KO mice were able to adoptively transfer the diseases into T cell-deficient mice. This indicates that CTLA-4 deficiency affects both central and peripheral tolerance and Treg cell-mediated suppression. Thus, CTLA-4 is a critical regulator of both self-tolerance and immune responses. This study provides a more complete understanding of the role of CTLA-4 in the development of autoimmunity.

We propose that the evolution of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) enabled the efficient digestion of plant tissues, including lignocellulose in cell walls, facilitating the evolution of uniquely specialized plant-feeding habits, such as leaf mining and stem and wood boring. Beetle diversity thus appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding PCWDEs.

The disease is characterized by the formation of granulomas, which are the result of the immune system’s response to the bacteria. We sequenced the genome of a patient with leprosy from Mexico, and compared it with that of the leprosy pathogen Mycobacterium leprae. We found that the two genomes are very similar, and that the leprosy pathogen has undergone extensive reductive evolution. This suggests that the leprosy pathogen has lost many genes that are required for survival in the host, and that the disease may be caused by a different pathogen than previously thought. We also found that a new leprosy pathogen, Mycobacterium lepromatosis, is present in Mexico. This pathogen is more closely related to the leprosy pathogen than to M. lepromatosis, and may be the cause of a different form of leprosy. Our findings have important implications for understanding the evolution of leprosy and the development of new treatments. (Show more)"

TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1 may act as a tumor suppressor in some settings.

However, the mechanism by which cofilin cuts the filament is unknown. Here, we show that the interaction of cofilin with the filament is strongly influenced by the mechanical state of the filament. We propose that this mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells.

We demonstrate that these factors are unique to Aβ-burdened neurons, since neighboring glial cells did not express similar molecules. Thus, we propose that the accumulation of Aβ in neurons may be a significant factor in the development of AD-related neuroinflammation.

Here, we show that, in cells experiencing such stress, the pyrophosphohydrolase RppH assumes a leading role in decapping those transcripts, preferring them as substrates over their triphosphorylated and diphosphorylated counterparts. This enzyme recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5′ termini, resulting in a one-nucleotide shift in substrate specificity. The unconventional manner in which RppH recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress.

Although the immune system is the main target of sepsis, it is also responsible for the development of immunosuppression, which is associated with poor clinical outcomes. We hypothesized that increasing arginine availability would restore T cell function and decrease immunosuppression during sepsis. We found that citrulline, an amino acid that is derived from arginine, was more efficient than arginine in increasing arginine plasma levels and restoring T cell mitochondrial function and proliferation while reducing immunosuppression. Because there is no specific therapeutic strategy to restore immune function after sepsis, we believe that our study provides evidence for developing citrulline-based clinical studies in sepsis.

SOC systems are characterized by a critical state, where the system is neither too slow nor too fast, and the probability distribution of the system’s activity decays as a power law. SOC systems are ubiquitous in nature, from earthquakes to neural networks, and are also of great interest in physics, where they are studied in relation to criticality. In this paper, we report on our discovery of a tropical model with self-organized criticality (SOC) behavior. Our model is continuous, in contrast to all known models of SOC, and is a certain scaling limit of the sandpile model, the first and archetypical model of SOC. We describe how our model is related to pattern formation and proportional growth phenomena and discuss the dichotomy between continuous and discrete models in several contexts. Our aim in this context is to present an idealized tropical toy model (cf. Turing reaction-diffusion model), requiring further investigation."

The ears of animals are diverse in form and function, but all are made up of cellular tissue and are morphologically part of the body. Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. The spider’s web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to sense the motion of web threads, which allows the spider to remotely detect and localize the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself. The spider also enables the flexibility to functionally adjust and regularly regenerate its external ""eardrum"" according to its needs. The outsourcing and supersizing of auditory function in spiders provide unique features for studying extended and regenerative sensing and designing novel acoustic flow detectors for precise fluid dynamic measurement and manipulation.

We found that soil health management practices that incorporate perennial vegetation, such as rotational grazing, can increase soil C storage and distribution between particulate and mineral-associated organic matter. These results highlight the potential of grasslands to sequester C in the United States and the importance of managing grasslands for climate-smart agriculture.

We identify three enzymes that are necessary or sufficient for the production of this pigment. We also identify nesocodin in the red nectar of the hummingbird-visited Jaltomata herrerae and provide molecular evidence for convergent evolution of this trait. This work identifies a convergently evolved trait in two vertebrate-pollinated species, suggesting that the red pigment is selectively favored and that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation.

Particularly striking are women with artificial skull deformations; the analysis of their collective genetic ancestry suggests an origin in southeastern Europe. In addition, functional variants revealed that they also differed in visible characteristics. This example of female-biased migration indicates that complex demographic processes during the Early Medieval period may have contributed in an unexpected way to shape the modern European genetic landscape.

We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4.

The improved polymerase ribozyme can synthesize a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and, in low yield, even tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR.

The disease is caused by degeneration of motor neurons, leading to paralysis and death. The disease is caused by mutations in genes encoding motor neuron proteins, but also by genetic risk factors, such as the C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion. We now report a method to rapidly produce motor neuron-like cells from living patients with ALS. This will enable high-throughput screening of drugs to identify potential treatments for ALS. The method can also be used to study the disease in other neurodegenerative diseases. This will help to accelerate ALS research and development of treatments. The method is also applicable to other neurodegenerative diseases. This is a major advance in ALS research."

However, the mechanisms by which pathogens influence the microbiota are poorly understood. Here, we show that the human pathogen Anaplasma phagocytophilum induces the expression of antifreeze glycoprotein (IAFG) in the tick Ixodes scapularis, which alters the gut microbiota and facilitates infection. We demonstrate that IAFGP binds the terminal d-alanine residue of the peptidoglycan cell wall of bacteria, resulting in altered permeability and the capacity of bacteria to form biofilms. These findings elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which a human pathogen appropriates an arthropod antibacterial protein to alter the gut microbiota and more effectively colonize the vector. This work provides insight into the mechanisms by which pathogens influence the vector microbiota and may lead to the development of new strategies to control vector-borne diseases. (Show more)"

The presence of a fused scapulocoracoid in adult individuals independently evolved in Jinguofortisidae and Confuciusornithiformes may relate to an accelerated osteogenesis during chondrogenesis and likely formed through the heterochronic process of peramorphosis by which these basal taxa retain the scapulocoracoid of the nonavian theropod ancestors with the addition of flight-related modifications. The discovery of Jinguofortis increases the known ecomorphological diversity of basal pygostylians and highlights the importance of developmental plasticity for understanding mosaic evolution in early birds.

However, the mechanisms by which hypoxia promotes breast cancer progression are not well understood. We show that hypoxia induces expression of the m6A demethylase AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), which increases NANOG mRNA levels and the percentage of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs). ALKBH5 expression is induced by hypoxia through the hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1α and HIF-2α, which also promote BCSC phenotype. NANOG mRNA methylation is reduced by ALKBH5, and NANOG mRNA methylation levels are increased in hypoxia-treated cells. Thus, ALKBH5 expression in response to hypoxia promotes BCSC phenotype. This study provides insight into the role of ALKBH5 in breast cancer progression and the hypoxic tumor microenvironment.

The source of this parchment, often called “uterine vellum,” has been a long-standing controversy in codicology. The Latin term abortivum in many sources has led some scholars to suggest that fetal calves or sheep skins were used. Others have argued that it would not be possible to sustain herds if so many pocket Bibles were produced from fetal skins, arguing instead for unexpected alternatives, such as rabbit. Here, we report a simple and objective method using standard conservation treatments to identify the animal origin of parchment. The noninvasive method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period.

The extinction occurred between 251.941 ± 0.037 and 251.880 ± 0.031 Mya, an interval of 60 ± 48 ka. Onset of a major reorganization of the carbon cycle immediately precedes the initiation of extinction and is punctuated by a sharp (3‰), short-lived negative spike in the isotopic composition of carbonate carbon. Carbon cycle volatility persists for ∼500 ka before a return to near preextinction values. Decamillenial to millennial level resolution of the mass extinction and its aftermath will permit a refined evaluation of the relative roles of rate-dependent processes contributing to the extinction, allowing insight into postextinction ecosystem expansion. This age model will also be critical for evaluating the plausibility of trigger and kill mechanisms. (Show more)"

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The RNA encodes a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC) that interacts with aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (denoted GlpD) and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that the RNA base pairs with the cadA and galE genes, repressing them. Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA. These results demonstrate that the translation and base-pairing functions compete. This is an example of a dual-function RNA that encodes a protein and base pairs with genes. The dual-function RNA is a rare example of a protein that interacts with a metabolic enzyme.

During the functional reduction process, the elevation of evolutionary rates reaches several new rate equilibria, possibly relating to the modified protein turnover rates in heterotrophic plastids.

The drought began in 2012 and has led to acute water shortages, groundwater overdraft, critically low streamflow, and enhanced wildfire risk. We find that precipitation deficits that occur when conditions are warm are more than twice as likely to yield drought years. We also find that although there has not been a substantial change in the probability of either negative or moderately negative precipitation anomalies in recent decades, the occurrence of drought years has been greater in the past two decades than in the preceding century. In addition, the probability that precipitation deficits co-occur with warm conditions and the probability that precipitation deficits produce drought have both increased. We conclude that anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of co-occurring warm–dry conditions like those that have created the acute human and ecosystem impacts associated with the “exceptional” 2012–2014 drought in California. Our results suggest that anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of drought in California. This is important because California is not alone in experiencing drought.

As an alternative approach, extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying the convergence of the targets and functions of the autism-risk genes to facilitate mapping out causal paths. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies.

These proteins form intracellular inclusion bodies that are characteristic of different neuropathological subtypes of the disease. The proteins that form inclusions are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. Rather, they are a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. This metastable state may be a consequence of the unique cellular environment of motor neurons, which are highly specialized for the transmission of motor commands. The metastable state may also be a consequence of the unique protein interactions of these proteins in motor neurons. This study suggests that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons.

The early diversification of the flowering plants is poorly understood, and the origin of aquatic angiosperms is even less understood. The research presented here centers on Montsechia vidalii, a fossil plant from the early Cretaceous that has been poorly understood in the past. Based upon the study of more than 1,000 carefully prepared specimens, a detailed analysis of Montsechia is presented. The morphology and anatomy of the plant, including aspects of its reproduction, suggest that Montsechia is sister to Ceratophyllum (whenever cladistic analyses are made with or without a backbone). Montsechia was an aquatic angiosperm living and reproducing below the surface of the water, similar to Ceratophyllum. Montsechia is Barremian in age, raising questions about the very early divergence of the Ceratophyllum clade compared with its position as sister to eudicots in many cladistic analyses. Lower Cretaceous aquatic angiosperms, such as Archaefructus and Montsechia, open the possibility that aquatic plants were locally common at a very early stage of angiosperm evolution and that aquatic"

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell"

Our results suggest that inhibition of YAP/TAZ activation is a promising strategy for the prevention of atherogenesis. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the role of YAP/TAZ in the development of atheroprone phenotypes and atherosclerotic lesions and identifies a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of atherosclerosis. This study also provides a new perspective for the understanding of the functional role of YAP/TAZ in vascular homeostasis and atherogenesis. The findings of this study may also be applicable to other cell types and tissues that are regulated by YAP/TAZ.

Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

However, these factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we use high-throughput experiments to investigate how changes in temperature affect the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We found that changes in temperature systematically altered the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures departed from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increased, meaning that more species were required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. Our findings have important implications for our ability to predict the impacts of climate change on ecosystem functioning. They also highlight the importance of considering the role of species interactions in mediating the impacts of environmental change. This is particularly important for understanding the potential for biodiversity loss to exacerbate the impacts of climate change."

However, the anatomical and functional organization of MEC is still poorly understood. Here, we used a portable two-photon microscope to record the activity of MEC neurons in freely behaving mice. We found that grid cells, which encode the spatial location of the animal in the environment, are anatomically distinct from other cell types, which suggests that they might form a separate network. These results provide a detailed view of the organization of MEC neurons in vivo and will be useful for future studies aimed at understanding the neural basis of navigation."

We demonstrate that striatonigral fibers originating in striosomes form highly unusual bouquet-like arborizations that target bundles of ventrally extending dopamine-containing dendrites and clusters of their parent nigral cell bodies. These clustered cell bodies in turn project to the striatum as part of the classic nigrostriatal pathway. Thus, these striosome–dendron bouquets likely represent subsystems with the nigro–striato–nigral loop that are affected in human disorders including Parkinson’s disease. Given evidence that striosomes receive input from cortical regions related to the control of mood and motivation and that they link functionally to reinforcement and decision-making, the striosome–dendron bouquets could be critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease. This work provides a unique view of the organization of the dopamine-containing nigral system. It also suggests that striosomes may be important in the control of movement and motivation.

We asked people to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Finally, we demonstrate that this signal is used by third-party listeners as a heuristic of how well people are connected: Conversations with faster response times were perceived as more connected than the same conversations with slower response times. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

SAN cells (SANCs) are responsible for generating the heart rate and are characterized by unique electrophysiological properties. SAN dysfunction is associated with a variety of cardiovascular diseases. Here, we report that stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is selectively expressed in SANCs and plays a critical role in SAN function. Cardiac-specific deletion of STIM1 in mice resulted in depletion of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ stores of SANCs and led to SAN dysfunction, as was evident by a reduction in heart rate, sinus arrest, and an exaggerated autonomic response to cholinergic signaling. Moreover, STIM1 influenced SAN function by regulating ionic fluxes in SANCs, including activation of a store-operated Ca2+ current, a reduction in L-type Ca2+ current, and enhancing the activities of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. These studies reveal that STIM1 is a multifunctional regulator of Ca2+ dynamics in SANCs that links SR Ca2+ store content with electrical events occurring in the plasma membrane, thereby contributing to automaticity of the SAN.

This study shows that natural landscapes such as forests can contribute to meeting both food and nutrition security goals. We found that deforestation led to a reduction in people’s fruit and vegetable consumption and thus vitamin A adequacy of their diets. Conversely, forest fragmentation led to an increase in fruit and vegetable consumption and dietary vitamin A adequacy. These findings have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. This study also highlights the importance of considering the role of natural landscapes in meeting nutrition goals."

We show that the increase in mechanization has led to higher subsoil stresses, which now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the recent discovery of a 150-million-year-old footprint of a sauropod, which is the oldest known footprint of a quadruped animal. Our findings suggest that the"
