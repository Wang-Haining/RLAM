In this work, we report the structure of ice II hydrate, which is a new phase of water. The structure is composed of a network of D2O channels, which are enclathrated by neon atoms. The guest atoms have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The resolved structure is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. Our results provide a new perspective on the structure of ice II and its relevance to the formation of ice II hydrates. They also provide a new route to the synthesis of ice II hydrates. This work is expected to be of interest to researchers in the fields of high-pressure science, hydrate science, and molecular dynamics simulation. (Show more)"

Although the evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we present a genomic and transcriptomic analysis of two distantly related myxozoan species and a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results show that the myxozoan body plan evolved from a free-living cnidarian and suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. These results have implications for understanding the origin of parasitism and the evolution of the parasite body plan. (Less)"

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes. Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. (Show more)"

In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of the Hv1 channel. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa in the field. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species of large herbivores in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This study highlights the importance of diet composition in understanding the role of LMH in African savanna biodiversity."

A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals.

The development of new antibiotics is a major challenge, since the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens to the existing drugs is a major obstacle. Here, we present a rational design approach to overcome this problem. We use computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome to screen a library of acylide antibiotics. The best candidates are then tested in vitro and in vivo, and the best compound is shown to be active against three of the most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. This study demonstrates the potential of computational drug design to address the problem of antibiotic resistance. The approach presented here can be used to develop new antibiotics for a wide range of pathogens. The compounds designed by us are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. This study is expected to contribute to the development of new antibiotics to combat the growing problem of antibiotic resistance. (Show more)"

However, in contrast to congenital deficiency, this is not fatal. CTLA-4 deletion induced preferential expansion of CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells. However, T cells from CTLA-4–deficient inducible KO mice were able to adoptively transfer the diseases into T cell-deficient mice.

TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor.

Here, we monitor and quantify the action of ADF/cofilin in different mechanical situations by using single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques, coupled to microfluidics. We find that local curvature favors severing, while tension surprisingly has no effect on cofilin binding and weakly enhances severing. Remarkably, we observe that filament segments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist, experience a mechanical torque upon cofilin binding. We propose that this ADF/cofilin-induced torque increases the severing rate constant 100-fold. A consequence of this mechanism is that cross-linked filament networks are severed by cofilin far more efficiently than nonconnected filaments."

To overcome this conundrum, we introduce the dual-field-of-view (FOV) high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) for simultaneously profiling aerosol and water cloud properties, especially water cloud microphysical properties. This instrument, verified by the Monte Carlo simulation and coincident observations of other techniques, was used to conduct a case study over Beijing. The observations show that increased aerosol loading led to increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius, consistent with expectations. However, the aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI process. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI."

K+ channels commonly possess two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. We found that the BK channel’s activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery are spatially related and that C-type inactivation is state-dependent. We propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. Our findings may help us understand the mechanism of K+ channel regulation and disease."

In the temperate regions, seasonal outbreaks of influenza virus correlate with decreases in ambient humidity. While low humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

Here, we show that the brain’s activity increases with each successive word in a sentence, but suddenly decreases whenever words can be merged into a phrase. This pattern of activity is consistent with a model of phrase construction, in which the brain first builds phrases and then merges them into longer sequences. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases.

We also show that this circuit is necessary for the rapid eating induced by LH stimulation. Surprisingly, we find that this circuit is not involved in the regulation of hunger or satiety, which are the other two major factors that govern normal feeding.

We find that the spider’s web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to capture the sound-induced air particle movements that approach the maximum physical efficiency better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself. The outsourcing and supersizing of auditory function in spiders provides unique features for studying extended and regenerative sensing and designing novel acoustic flow detectors for precise fluid dynamic measurement and manipulation."

This study demonstrates the feasibility of using metagenomic next-generation sequencing to detect undifferentiated febrile illness in resource-scarce settings and the potential for this approach to be used to monitor the pathogen landscape in these settings. Ongoing surveillance of undifferentiated febrile illness is needed to better understand the breadth of endemic, zoonotic, or emerging pathogens.

However, the stability of the replicative pol δ holoenzyme is unknown. We developed unique kinetic assays to measure the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. Our results indicate that the human pol δ holoenzyme is more stable than its S. cerevisiae counterpart and that it maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This study provides a unique insight into the molecular basis of lagging strand replication in humans. It also provides a foundation for future studies on the role of the pol δ holoenzyme in human diseases."

We find that the system is biased toward reporting on male victims, and that the topics are not well captured by existing structured variables. Our method offers a flexible and broadly applicable approach to model topics in text data. It can be applied to many domains, and can be extended to other types of data. We hope that it will be widely used to identify latent patterns in text data."

We show that the introduction of the bacterium into Europe was preceded by repeated climate-driven reintroductions of the bacterium into European harbors from reservoirs in Asia. Our results suggest that the introduction of the bacterium into Europe was the result of a series of events, rather than a single event.

We find that the settlement of Madagascar happened in several waves, with a recent admixture of Malagasy individuals. The distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. This study provides a detailed picture of the human history of Madagascar.

The band structures of the 2D photonic crystals are predicted to produce unconventional atom–light interaction behaviors, including anisotropic emission, suppressed spontaneous decay, and photon-mediated atom–atom interactions controlled by the position of the atomic array relative to the photonic crystal. The device configuration also enables application of optical tweezers for controlled placement of atoms. Devices can be fabricated reliably from a 200-nm silicon nitride device layer using a lithography-based process, producing predicted optical properties in transmission and reflection measurements.

These results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities. Our results also suggest that the physical appearance of neighborhoods may be a useful indicator of the economic and social health of cities.

Here we propose a model of language processing that is based on a single mechanism: the ability of neurons to change their firing rates in response to experience. This mechanism is adaptive, and the changes in firing rates are stored in dynamic variables that are read out for processing. This model provides a unified account of the processing of syntax, semantics, and phonology, and it is consistent with a number of experimental findings. It also provides a mechanism for the binding of linguistic features over time, which is a key aspect of language processing. This work provides a step toward a computational neurobiology of language."

We show that the size, shape, compactness, stiffness, and location of the siRNA attachment locus on the DNA nanostructure are critical design parameters for the delivery of the DNA nanostructures into the plant cells and the corresponding gene silencing efficiency. Our work establishes the feasibility of biomolecule delivery to plants with DNA nanostructures and both details the design parameters of importance for plant cell internalization and also assesses the impact of DNA nanostructure geometry for gene silencing mechanisms.

However, decades of monitoring and regulatory efforts have focused almost exclusively on the largest watersheds, ignoring the vast majority of smaller tributaries. We show that the 6 largest watersheds of a large lake accounted for ∼70% of the daily nutrient loads delivered to the lake. However, the remaining 279 watersheds were responsible for ∼30% of the daily loads, and their nutrient loads were high for their size. This study reveals that small watersheds may be a significant source of nutrients to the lake, and that nutrient management efforts should be expanded to these smaller watersheds. This could reduce the ecological impacts of nutrient loading on valuable nearshore ecosystems. Our findings have implications for the management of nutrient loading in large water bodies worldwide."

We show that the event was linked to an injection of organic matter–derived C over a large area and to an increase in nutrient fluxes. Earth system modeling indicates that the event was linked to enhanced thermocline stratification and increased nutrient fluxes during this global warming within an icehouse. This work provides insights into the potential for future abrupt warming events and the potential for the release of large amounts of organic matter–derived C to the ocean."

We hypothesize that the large size of prehistoric animals, including the sauropods, may have been a key factor in the evolution of ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction.
