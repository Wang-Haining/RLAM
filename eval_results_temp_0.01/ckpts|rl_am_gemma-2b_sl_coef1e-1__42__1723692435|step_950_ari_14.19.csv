Here, we present a comparative analysis of the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species and a cnidarian species. Our results show that the myxozoan body plan was reduced to a minimal structure, and that the genome was reduced to one of the smallest reported in animals.

In this study, we show that the viral accessory protein Orf6 is able to block nuclear import of ISGs by directly interacting with the Nup98-Rae1 complex. We also show that a simple mutation in Orf6 abolishes its ability to block nuclear import. Our findings provide a mechanistic understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 is able to evade the antiviral action of IFN.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species (six wild, one domestic) in semiarid African savanna. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers. Grass consumption inferred from DNA sequence relative read abundance ranged from &gt;99% (plains zebra) to &lt;1% (dik-dik). Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This study highlights the need for more comprehensive and species-level diet information in future studies of herbivore ecology and coexistence. (Show more)"

The disease is fatal within a few years after disease onset. The cytopathological hallmark of MSA is the accumulation of alpha-synuclein (α-syn) aggregates in affected oligodendrocytes. Several studies point to α-syn oligomerization and aggregation as a mediator of neurotoxicity in synucleinopathies including MSA. Here, we show that the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 is able to limit the progressive toxicity of α-syn aggregation in a mouse model of MSA. This suggests that VX-765, a drug that was well tolerated in a 6 wk-long phase II trial in patients with epilepsy, is a promising candidate to achieve disease modification in synucleinopathies by limiting α-syn accumulation. This study opens the way for further preclinical and clinical studies. The results also suggest that α-syn aggregation is a common pathogenic mechanism in synucleinopathies.

We further demonstrate that the low probability to become dominant in high-anxious animals can be reversed by enhancing brain energy metabolism in the nucleus accumbens.

The treatment of hypertension is a major challenge for the medical community. The most common drugs for treating hypertension are calcium channel blockers. These drugs are effective, but they have side effects. We show that the three major classes of calcium channel blockers activate the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stromal-interacting molecule (STIM) Ca2+ sensor proteins and the plasma membrane ORAI Ca2+ channels. Our data indicate that these drugs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. Our findings unravel a mechanism of LCCBs action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM. Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. This study provides a new perspective on the mechanism of action of calcium channel blockers and may lead to the development of new drugs for treating hypertension and heart failure. This study may also lead to the development of new drugs for treating hypertension and heart failure."

We show that the NWFP’s effects on bird populations are complex and not as straightforward as expected. We found that the NWFP halted the decline of early-seral bird populations, but the opposite was true for older-forest–associated species. This is partly explained by the fact that the NWFP did not halt clearcutting on federal land, which continues to be a threat to older forests. Our findings highlight the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure."

This problem can be addressed by the development of new antibacterial agents to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. Computational approaches are essential tools to this end since their application enables fast and early strategical decisions in the drug development process. We present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The predicted best candidate is synthetically more accessible, exhibits higher solubility and binding affinity to the ribosome, and is up to 56 times more active against resistant pathogens than telithromycin. Notably, the best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. We believe that our design strategy can be applied to other antibiotic classes and to other pathogens. This"

Here, we introduce a network architecture based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice, and automatically adapts to different problems. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data."

Today, most human plague cases are bubonic, caused by spillover of infected fleas from rodent epizootics, or pneumonic, caused by inhalation of infectious droplets. However, little is known about the historical spread of plague in Europe during the Second Pandemic (14–19th centuries), including the Black Death, which led to high mortality and recurrent epidemics for hundreds of years. Here, we describe a compartmental model for plague transmission by a human ectoparasite vector. Using Bayesian inference, we found that this model fits mortality curves from nine outbreaks in Europe better than models for rodent or pneumonic transmission. Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346–1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats.

However, the evolution of brain neuronal density is still poorly understood. We present a comprehensive dataset of neuron numbers in amniotes and use it to reconstruct the evolution of brain neuronal density. We show that reptiles have not only small brains relative to body size but also low neuronal densities, resulting in average neuron numbers over 20 times lower than those in birds and mammals of similar body size. Amniote brain evolution is characterized by the following four major shifts in neuron–brain scaling. The most dramatic increases in brain neurons occurred independently with the appearance of birds and mammals, resulting in convergent neuron scaling in the two endothermic lineages."

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal cells is not well understood. We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This study also provides a molecular basis for the use of TRAP1 as a therapeutic target in cancer. (Cancer Res; 71: 5410–5419, 2011) Cancer Res;"

They are dynamic polymers that can be assembled and disassembled. The actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin family is the main regulator of actin filament disassembly. It is a key player in many cellular processes, including cell motility. However, how it does so is still not fully understood. Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques, coupled to microfluidics, to study the action of ADF/cofilin in different mechanical situations. We find that the mechanical situation can have a dramatic effect on ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever actin filaments. We propose that this mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. This work provides a new perspective on the action of ADF/cofilin and opens new avenues for understanding and modulating actin filament disassembly in cells. It also provides a platform for developing new tools for single-molecule studies."

We found that fructose versus glucose led to greater hunger and desire for food and a greater willingness to give up long-term monetary rewards to obtain immediate high-calorie foods. These findings suggest that fructose may promote feeding behavior. Our results also suggest that the effects of fructose on brain and behavior may be mediated, at least in part, by the hormone insulin. Future studies are needed to determine the extent to which the effects of fructose on brain and behavior are specific to fructose or are a consequence of the effects of high-fructose corn syrup, which is a mixture of fructose and glucose.

The island is located ∼400 km from the east coast of Africa, but its genetic and linguistic traits are from both Southeast Asia and Eastern Africa. We used a grid-based approach to sample at high resolution the genomic diversity (including maternal lineages, paternal lineages, and genome-wide data) across Madagascar. We find a common Bantu and Austronesian descent for all Malagasy individuals with a limited paternal contribution from Europe and the Middle East. The distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. This study provides a comprehensive view of the settlement history of Madagascar. It also provides a reference for the genomic diversity of the Malagasy population.

This study shows that the evolution of an aquatic lifestyle is driving three of the four extant aquatic mammal clades toward a size attractor at ∼500 kg. The existence of this body size attractor and the relatively rapid selection toward, and limited deviation from, this attractor rule out most hypothesized drivers of size increase. These three independent body size increases and a shared aquatic optimum size are consistent with control by differences in the scaling of energetic intake and cost functions with body size between the terrestrial and aquatic realms. Under this energetic model, thermoregulatory costs constrain minimum size, whereas limitations on feeding efficiency constrain maximum size. Rather than being released from size pressures, water-dwelling mammals are driven and confined to larger body sizes by the strict energetic demands of the aquatic medium."

However, it is difficult to be well represented in current climate models. Progress on understanding ACI processes is hampered by inadequate observational capability. High-resolution and simultaneous observations of diurnal aerosol loading and cloud microphysical properties are challenging for current remote-sensing techniques. To overcome this conundrum, we introduce the dual-field-of-view (FOV) high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) for simultaneously profiling aerosol and water cloud properties, especially water cloud microphysical properties. This instrument, verified by the Monte Carlo simulation and coincident observations of other techniques, was used to investigate the interactions between aerosol loading and water cloud microphysical properties.

The ancestral environmental temperatures thereby determined for these photic-zone organisms––shown in modern taxa to correlate strongly with thermostability––are inferred to reflect ancient surface-environment paleotemperatures.

Ion channels are also the main targets of drugs. Ion channels are open or closed, and the open probability is determined by the channel’s conformation. Ion channels have two types of conformational gates, one for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other for slow channel inactivation/recovery. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation.

We used a global model to estimate the climate and health outcomes of a phaseout of fossil fuels, indicating the potential benefits of a rapid phaseout. We show that it can avoid an excess mortality rate of 3.61 million per year from outdoor air pollution worldwide. This could be up to 5.55 million per year by additionally controlling nonfossil anthropogenic sources. Globally, fossil-fuel-related emissions account for about 65% of the excess mortality, and 70% of the climate cooling by anthropogenic aerosols. Aerosols affect the hydrologic cycle, contributing to water and food security. We conclude that a rapid phaseout of fossil-fuel-related emissions and major reductions of other anthropogenic sources are needed to save millions of lives, restore aerosol-perturbed rainfall patterns, and limit global warming to 2 °C.

However, the number of reconstructed genomes from the Neolithic period is too few to explore its diversity during this critical period of development. Here, we present 17 Y. pestis genomes dating to 5,000 to 2,500 y BP from a wide geographic expanse across Eurasia. Our results suggest a nonflea-adapted and potentially extinct single lineage that persisted over millennia without significant parallel diversification, accompanied by rapid dispersal across continents throughout this period. Together, these data reveal the dynamic nature of plague’s formative years in terms of its early evolution and ecology. This information is critical for understanding the origins of plague and its impact on human history. (Show more)"

However, the management of agricultural lands is often at odds with SOC sequestration, as intensive crop production on grassland-derived Mollisols liberates massive amounts of carbon to the atmosphere. We show that soil management practices that reduce soil disturbance, diversify crop rotations, and integrate livestock can sequester SOC on these soils. These practices also improve soil health, as demonstrated by enhanced soil microbial biomass, activity, and nutrient cycling. Our results highlight the potential of well-managed grasslands to sequester carbon on agricultural lands and highlight the need for more research on the effects of soil management on SOC sequestration in grasslands worldwide."

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how HKU4 and HKU5 transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions.

We found that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion.

In the hypothesized RNA world, before the evolution of proteins, genetic information was stored in RNA molecules that were replicated by ribozymes. In an effort toward reconstructing RNA-based life in the laboratory, in vitro evolution was used to improve dramatically the activity and generality of an RNA polymerase ribozyme by selecting variants that can synthesize functional RNA molecules from an RNA template. The improved polymerase ribozyme is able to synthesize a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and, in low yield, even tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins."

Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology.

We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals, but we did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides. These results suggest that ultrafine vellum does not necessarily derive from the use of abortive or newborn animals with ultrathin hides, but could equally well reflect a production process that allowed the skins of maturing animals of several species to be rendered into vellum of equal quality and fineness."

Here, we present a model of the trajectory of plastid genome evolution during the transition from autotrophy to a nonphotosynthetic parasitic lifestyle. We show that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner. During the functional reduction process, the elevation of evolutionary rates reaches several new rate equilibria, possibly relating to the modified protein turnover rates in heterotrophic plastids. Our findings suggest that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner."

We use a high-resolution large ensemble to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the probability of occurrence of multiyear rainfall deficits in southwestern South Africa. We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the probability of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% by the year 2100 under an intermediate-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5) and to 80% under a high-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5-8.5). These results highlight the strong sensitivity of the drought risk in SSA to future anthropogenic emissions. This work provides a valuable contribution to the ongoing debate on the role of anthropogenic climate change in the 2015–2017 Cape Town drought. (Abridged)

In this study, we found that neuroinflammation was reduced in both the early and later stages of EAE in microglia/macrophage-specific ASK1 knockout mice, whereas only the later-stage neuroinflammation was ameliorated in astrocyte-specific ASK1 knockout mice.

The drought began in 2012 and now includes the lowest calendar-year and 12-mo precipitation, the highest annual temperature, and the most extreme drought indicators on record. The extremely warm and dry conditions have led to acute water shortages, groundwater overdraft, critically low streamflow, and enhanced wildfire risk. We find that precipitation deficits in California were more than twice as likely to yield drought years if they occurred when conditions were warm. We find that although there has not been a substantial change in the probability of either negative or moderately negative precipitation anomalies in recent decades, the occurrence of drought years has been greater in the past two decades than in the preceding century. In addition, the probability that precipitation deficits co-occur with warm conditions and the probability that precipitation deficits produce drought have both increased. We conclude that anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of co-occurring warm–dry conditions like those that have created the acute human and ecosystem impacts associated with the “exceptional” 2012–2014 drought in California."

The etiology of autism is so complicated because it involves the effects of variants of several hundred risk genes along with the contribution of environmental factors. Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. As an alternative approach, extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying the convergence of the targets and functions of the autism-risk genes to facilitate mapping out causal paths. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of"

We demonstrate that the release of aggregates requires N-ethylmalemide–sensitive fusion protein 1, indicating that active release and uptake of aggregates are important elements of spreading and disease progression.

However, the factors that contribute to virus spillover from bats are not well understood. Here, we identified and characterized a protein (MTX) that is highly concentrated in the submandibular salivary gland of the bat, Myotis pilosus. MTX inhibits the antiviral immune response of the host and facilitates viral infection by selectively inhibiting the epoxide hydrolase function of leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) to inhibit LTA4 hydrolysis and the generation of potent lipid chemoattractant for host defense against infection. MTX has no effect on the aminopeptidase function of LTA4H and therefore does not impair the antiinflammatory function of LTA4H. MTX potently inhibits proinflammatory proteases to induce immune tolerance and maintain high stability. This study provides deeper insight into immunologically privileged sites for microbial community residence in bats and supports the therapeutic potential of targeting MTX-LTA4H. The findings also provide a deeper understanding of the role of MTX in the immune system of bats and the potential for MTX as a therapeutic target for the treatment of viral infections. This"

The squid provides a protected environment for the bacteria, which in turn provide a source of light for the host. We show here that the squid regulates the provision of a critical nutrient to its symbionts, chitin, which is delivered in a precise quantity and at a precise time. We also show that the timing of chitin delivery is essential for the symbiosis to persist. This work suggests that the squid may be able to control the activities of its symbionts through the strategic provision of nutrients, whose catabolism modulates conditions like pH or anoxia in the symbionts’ habitat. This work may have implications for other symbioses in which the host regulates the activities of its symbionts. (Show more)"

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced mutagenesis remain unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We observed distinct pol II stalling profiles for the three regioisomeric EtdT lesions. Intriguingly, pol II stalling at O2-EtdT and N3-EtdT sites is exacerbated by TFIIS-stimulated proofreading activity. Assessment for the impact of the EtdT lesions on individual fidelity checkpoints provided further mechanistic insights, where the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion. For the N3-EtdT lesion that dis"

To better understand how sequential proteolysis contributes to MERS-CoV infection, we introduced mutations that blocked the first cleavages of MERS-CoV spike (S) glycoproteins. These mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses trafficked past cell-surface proteases and into endosomes, whereas precleaved viruses used endosomal fusion-activating proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry. Uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to cell receptor-induced conformational changes, the first cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection"

It is a dynamic and complex environment that is constantly being remodeled in normal and cancer cells. Here we apply quantitative proteomics to reveal how a collection of some 700 surface proteins is dramatically remodeled in an isogenic breast epithelial cell line stably expressing any of six of the most prominent proliferative oncogenes, including the receptor tyrosine kinases, EGFR and HER2, and downstream signaling partners such as KRAS, BRAF, MEK, and AKT. We find that each oncogene has somewhat different surfaceomes, but the functions of these proteins are harmonized by common biological themes including up-regulation of nutrient transporters, down-regulation of adhesion molecules and tumor suppressing phosphatases, and alteration in immune modulators. These studies provide a broad systems-level view of how specific driver oncogenes remodel the surfaceome and the glycoproteome in a cell autologous fashion, and suggest possible surface targets, and combinations thereof, for drug and biomarker discovery.

Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology.

We identify a JNK-dependent feedback amplification loop between intestinal tumors and the microbiome. We also highlight the importance of controlling the activity level of JNK signaling to maintain epithelial barrier function and host–microbe homeostasis. Our work provides insights into the crosstalk between tumors and the microbiome and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment. (Show more)"

Chemotherapy is the most common treatment for breast cancer, but the response to chemotherapy is heterogeneous, and many patients relapse. Here we show that the expression of the type I tyrosine kinaselike orphan receptor ROR1 is increased in breast cancer cells following treatment with chemotherapy. We also show that treatment of mice bearing breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) with the humanized anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab repressed expression of genes associated with breast cancer stemness, reduced activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or BMI1, and impaired the capacity of breast cancer PDXs to metastasize or reengraft Rag2−/−γc−/− mice. Finally, treatment of PDX-bearing mice with cirmtuzumab and paclitaxel was more effective than treatment with either alone in eradicating breast cancer PDXs. These results indicate that targeting ROR1 may improve the response to chemotherapy of patients with breast cancer. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Silencing of the underlying gene in transgenic plants abolished production of aliphatic and aromatic nitrogenous volatiles in ripe fruit, and metabolomic analysis of these fruit revealed the accumulation of 2-isobutyl-tetrahydrothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid, a known conjugate of cysteine and 3-methylbutanal.

Here we propose a computational model of memory in the brain. Our model is based on the idea that memory is supported by a form of synaptic plasticity that reduces the firing rate of neurons. This adaptive change in excitability is dependent on experience and can be used to store information. We show that this mechanism can support memory on timescales ranging from milliseconds to seconds. Our model provides a neurobiological substrate for memory that is sensitive to context and serial order. This work provides a step toward a computational neurobiology of language.

Here, we report the delivery of siRNA to plants using DNA nanostructures. We show that the size, shape, compactness, stiffness, and attachment location of the DNA nanostructure are important design parameters for the delivery of the cargo across the cell wall. We also show that the delivery of the cargo depends on the endogenous gene silencing pathway. Our work establishes the feasibility of delivering biomolecules to plants and also details the design parameters of importance for plant cell internalization and also assesses the impact of DNA nanostructure geometry for gene silencing mechanisms.

In the United States, the majority of nutrient inputs to lakes come from small tributaries, which drain large surrounding watersheds. However, decades of monitoring and regulatory efforts have focused on large watersheds, leaving small tributaries largely unaddressed. We show that small tributaries can be a significant source of nutrients to lakes, especially in nearshore areas. Our findings suggest that nutrient management efforts should focus on small tributaries to reduce the ecological impacts of nutrient loading on valuable nearshore ecosystems."

Here we show that NMDAR-Abs change the intrinsic cortical microcircuit and neuronal population dynamics to alter the spectral composition of spontaneous EEG activity and predispose brain dynamics to paroxysmal abnormalities. Based on local field potential recordings in a mouse model, we validate a dynamic causal model of NMDAR-Ab effects on cortical microcircuitry. Using this model, we identify the key synaptic parameters that best explain EEG paroxysms in pediatric patients with NMDAR-Ab encephalitis. Finally, we show that NMDAR-Ab–related changes render microcircuitry critically susceptible to overt EEG paroxysms when these key parameters are changed, even though the same parameter fluctuations are tolerated in the in silico model of the control condition. These findings offer mechanistic insights into circuit-level dysfunction induced by NMDAR-Abs. This work may help to guide the development of new therapies for this devastating disease.

Here, we present a study of an abrupt climate change event that occurred during a glacial period. We show that this event was associated with a global warming and a doubling of atmospheric CO2. We also show that this event was associated with an injection of organic matter–derived carbon into the ocean. This carbon was associated with anoxia and nutrient release, which may have led to a biodiversity nadir. Our results highlight the importance of studying abrupt climate change events in the context of the Earth system. This is important for understanding the potential impacts of climate change on the biosphere and for understanding the potential for feedbacks between climate and biosphere. (Show more)"

Certification is the tool most used to fulfill these procurement policies, and around 20% of global palm oil production was certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) in 2017. However, the effect of certification on deforestation in oil palm plantations remains unclear. Here, we use a comprehensive dataset of RSPO-certified and noncertified oil palm plantations (∼188,000 km2) in Indonesia, the leading producer of palm oil, as well as annual remotely sensed metrics of tree cover loss and fire occurrence, to evaluate the impact of certification on deforestation and fire. Our results suggest that certification reduced deforestation in Indonesia. Nevertheless, most plantations contained little residual forest when they received certification. As a result, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is"

In vertebrates, sex is determined by a single locus, which can be either male- or female-determining. In species with multiple sex determination alleles, the sex of an individual can be determined by multiple loci, resulting in a spectrum of sex classes. Here we investigate the effects of multiple sex determination alleles on secondary sexual characteristics in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii. We find that multiple alleles can produce a modular interplay of sex linkage and sex limitation, resulting in a spectrum of sexual phenotypes. This provides context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of the maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations."

Our findings contribute to understanding how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs. They also help to build a broader perspective on predatory niche diversification via morphological innovation and evolution. These findings are fundamental to understand how ecosystems function."

Soil compaction is a major threat to soil productivity, but it is difficult to assess its spatial extent. We developed a global map of subsoil compaction risk based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the recent discovery of a 150-million-year-old footprint of a sauropod in the Morrison Formation of Colorado, USA. The discovery suggests that the mechanical footprint of sauropods may have been a major driver of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction."
