The structure of the hydrate is also important for understanding the formation mechanism of the hydrate and the role of the hydrate in the deep ocean. However, the structure of the hydrate is still controversial. In this work, we report the structure of the hydrate with the guest atoms in the channels of the hydrate. This work provides a new perspective for understanding the structure of the hydrate. It also provides a new method for the synthesis of the hydrate with the guest atoms. This work is expected to be of great interest to the scientific community."

The most prominent reconstruction programs are due to von Neumann, Mackey, Jauch, Piron, Abramsky, and Coecke. The present paper provides a purely categorical approach to the foundations of quantum theory. The main result is that the category of Hilbert spaces and bounded operators is equivalent to the category of continuous linear operators on the category of sets. This resolves a question raised in the context of reconstruction programs. The result is of interest in its own right, and it also provides a new perspective on the relationship between the categories of Hilbert spaces and von Neumann algebras."

However, the evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, and the molecular basis for the transition from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic myxozoan is unknown. Here, we report the results of a comparative analysis of the genomes of two myxozoan species and a cnidarian parasite, and we show that myxozoans are a sister taxon to the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insight into the molecular basis of the evolution of parasitism. (Show more)"

We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

The development of new antibiotics is a major challenge. Here, we present a rational design approach to identify new antibiotics. The approach is based on the prediction of the solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity of acylide antibiotics. We show that the predicted best candidate is more active than telithromycin, the only approved acylide antibiotic, and that it is up to 56 times more active than the most potent compound in the FDA priority list. The predicted best candidate is synthetically more accessible, exhibits higher solubility and binding affinity to the ribosome, and is up to 56 times more active against resistant pathogens than telithromycin. Notably, the best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

The present study shows that ingestion of fructose relative to glucose results in greater brain activation in regions involved in attention and reward processing, greater hunger, and a greater willingness to give up long-term monetary rewards to obtain immediate high-calorie foods. These findings suggest that fructose may be a weaker suppressor of appetite than glucose. The results also suggest that the brain may be a useful target for the development of novel strategies to reduce the consumption of high-calorie foods."

We used a grid-based approach to sample the genomic diversity across Madagascar, from the north to the south, from the east to the west. We found that the Malagasy population is a mixture of Bantu and Austronesian populations, with a limited contribution from Europe and the Middle East. The admixture happened recently, suggesting a rapid settlement of Madagascar during the last millennium. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. Our results provide a comprehensive view of the history of Madagascar.

These findings demonstrate that in mouse airway cells, rhinovirus replicates preferentially at nasal cavity temperature due, in part, to a less efficient antiviral defense response of infected cells at cool temperature. This temperature-dependent growth phenotype may contribute to the high rate of reinfection with rhinovirus. The identification of this mechanism may lead to the development of new antiviral therapies for the common cold. (Show more)"

This finding provides a new perspective for understanding the regulation of K+ channel activation and inactivation. It also provides a new strategy for the development of drugs that can block the channel without affecting its normal function.

This pattern of activity is consistent with a neural implementation of a merge operation, which applies equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases.

By sensing the motion of web threads, the spider remotely detects and localizes the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave, such as those emitted by approaching prey or predators. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater"

We introduce a method to identify topics in a corpus and represent documents as topic sequences. Our method is based on advances in theoretical machine learning, which have led to the development of a sparse representation of an embedding space. We show that this representation can be used to identify latent topics and that it can be interpreted as a generative model. We illustrate our method with a prominent example of underutilized text: the US National Violent Death Reporting System. Our results provide a detailed quantitative picture of reporting about lethal violence and its gendered nature. Our method offers a flexible and broadly applicable approach to model topics in text data. It can be applied to many domains, including social media, news, and medical records. It can also be extended to other types of data, such as images and videos. Our method is a promising step toward understanding the latent patterns in text data."

This epidemic marked the start of the second plague pandemic, which lasted in Europe until the early 19th century. This pandemic is generally understood as the consequence of a singular introduction of Yersinia pestis, after which the disease established itself in European rodents over four centuries. To locate these putative plague reservoirs, we studied the climate fluctuations that preceded regional plague epidemics, based on a dataset of 7,711 georeferenced historical plague outbreaks and 15 annually resolved tree-ring records from Europe and Asia. We provide evidence for repeated climate-driven reintroductions of the bacterium into European harbors from reservoirs in Asia, with a delay of 15 ± 1 y. Our analysis finds no support for the existence of permanent plague reservoirs in medieval Europe. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the history of the plague and its impact on human history. They also have implications for the spread of Y. pestis in the 21st century."

The identification of targets for the treatment of AML is therefore of great importance. In this study, we show that the IL1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) is expressed on candidate leukemic stem cells in the majority of AML patients, but not on normal hematopoietic stem cells. We further show that monoclonal antibodies targeting IL1RAP have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We also demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects, and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Finally, we show that an antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling can suppress the proliferation of primary human AML cells. These results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. The results also provide a potential strategy for the treatment of other diseases in which IL1 signaling is important. (Show more)"

We used a grid-based approach to sample the genomic diversity across the island, allowing us to study the history of the island in a more detailed way than previous studies. We find that Madagascar has a Bantu and Austronesian ancestry, with a limited contribution from Europe and the Middle East. The settlement history of Madagascar is complex, with a recent arrival of Malagasy individuals, but also a heterogeneous history of admixture and demographic growth. The distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island shows that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. Finally, we find that a few centuries are sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations.

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete. These findings suggest that the translation and base-pairing functions compete for the same resource, suggesting that the protein and RNA are encoded by the same gene. This is an example of a"

Our findings suggest that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner. The evolutionary rates of the remaining functional complexes reach several new rate equilibria, possibly relating to the modified protein turnover rates in heterotrophic plastids. These findings have implications for the study of the evolution of the plastid genome and the molecular biology of plastids. (Show more)"

These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting.

Here, we show that the presence of coaggregating proteins in ALS is not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of mutant superaggregation-prone proteins, but rather that the coaggregating proteins are metastable in motor neurons. This finding suggests that the metastable proteins are a more general feature of ALS, and that the disease is associated with a failure of protein homeostasis in motor neurons. This failure is likely to be the result of a progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in motor neurons, which is a unique setting. This finding has implications for the development of therapeutic strategies for ALS. (Show more)"

This glycan is released by host cells in the hours before dusk, when the host is most likely to be quiescent. The glycan is catabolized by the symbiont, which is able to maintain a normal population level only until the organ reaches maturity. Finally, the catabolism of the glycan is required for the host to maintain a periodic acidification of the organ, which is necessary for the symbiont to produce light at night.

In this study, we systematically investigated the impact of O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (EtdT) lesions on transcription. We found that the three regioisomeric EtdT lesions have distinct effects on transcription. The transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion. For the N3-EtdT lesion that disrupts base pairing, multiple transcriptional lesion bypass routes were found. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop). The Pro-Gate loop faces toward the minor groove of RNA:DNA hybrid and is involved in modulating the translocation of minor-groove alkylated DNA template after nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion."

Indeed, STING deficiency caused glucose intolerance due to impaired insulin secretion, indicating that STING is required for normal β-cell function. Moreover, we found that STING is required for normal β-cell function, and its deficiency decreased expression of β-cell function–related genes, including Glut2, Kcnj11, and Abcc8.

The SAN is composed of specialized cardiomyocytes, which are responsible for generating the electrical impulse that drives the heart. The SAN is a highly coordinated system that is able to adjust heart rate to meet hemodynamic demand. Here, we report that stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is a key regulator of the electrical activity of the SAN. We show that STIM1 is expressed in the specialized cardiomyocytes of the SAN and is required for the electrical activity of these cells. These studies reveal that STIM1 is a multifunctional regulator of Ca2+ dynamics in the SAN that links the content of Ca2+ stores with electrical events occurring in the plasma membrane, thereby contributing to automaticity of the SAN. These findings have important implications for understanding the regulation of SAN function and may lead to the development of new therapies for cardiac arrhythmias. (Show more)"

However, the function of Si in plant physiology has been debated. In this study, we show that Si accumulation and insect herbivory are positively correlated in rice, and that Si pretreatment enhances rice resistance against the rice leaffolder. We also show that Si pretreatment increases the accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA), which in turn enhances the expression of defense genes and the accumulation of Si-associated proteins. These results suggest that Si and JA may interact in the defense response against insect herbivores. This study provides a new perspective on the function of Si in plant defense. (Show more)"

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants."
