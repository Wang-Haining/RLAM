Here, we show that the Myxozoa are a sister group to the cnidarians, and we provide evidence for the extreme reduction in gene content and genome size that is characteristic of the Myxozoa. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by a reduction in genome size and gene content. This is a major evolutionary transition, and our results may provide insights into the origins of parasitism. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to block the nuclear import of type I IFNs, which is a mechanism of viral antagonism that has not been described before. Our results provide a mechanism of viral antagonism that could be used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the antiviral action of type I IFNs.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1, but the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant African LMH species. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers, and dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.

The strongest genetic risk factor influencing susceptibility to AD is the APOE gene. APOE isoform is highly associated with AD risk, and the presence of two copies of the APOE4 allele increases risk by ∼12-fold. We found that APOE isoform is highly important in regulating the rate of astrocytic phagocytosis, which is a major process in normal synapse pruning and turnover. APOE2 enhances the rate of phagocytosis, whereas APOE4 decreases it. These studies suggest that APOE4 may be associated with defective phagocytic capacity of astrocytes, which may accelerate the rate of accumulation of senescent synapses and enhance their vulnerability to classical-complement-cascade mediated neurodegeneration. This hypothesis may help to explain the increased risk of AD associated with APOE4. Further studies are needed to test this hypothesis. (PsycINFO Database Record"

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria is more complex than previously appreciated. We have shown that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor.

We used a grid-based approach to sample the genomic diversity across the island, and we found that the Malagasy population is a mixture of Bantu and Austronesian populations, with a limited contribution from Europe and the Middle East. We also found that the settlement of Madagascar happened in a sex-biased way, with a higher probability of settlement from Africa than from Asia. Finally, we found that the genetic structure of the population is already detectable after a few centuries, suggesting that the island is a good laboratory to study the effects of geography and time on the human genome.

This mechanosensory system is mediated by the Chp chemosensory system, which regulates the production of the second messenger cAMP and the expression of hundreds of genes, including key virulence factors. Our results thus demonstrate that type IV pili are not only used for surface attachment, but also as a sensor that regulates the expression of virulence factors.

In this study, we show that the RNA pyrophosphohydrolase RppH, which is inactivated by the very conditions of disulfide stress that enable Np4-capped RNAs to accumulate to high levels, is the predominant decapping enzyme in Escherichia coli cells experiencing such stress. Unexpectedly, this enzyme recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5′ termini, resulting in a one-nucleotide shift in substrate specificity. The unconventional manner in which RppH recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress.

We observed prominent slow C-type inactivation/recovery in BK channels by an extreme low concentration of extracellular K+ together with a Y294E/K/Q/S or Y279F mutation whose equivalent in Shaker channels (T449E/K/D/Q/S or W434F) caused a greatly accelerated rate of C-inactivation or constitutive C-inactivation. C-type inactivation in most K+ channels occurs upon sustained membrane depolarization or channel opening and then recovers during hyperpolarized membrane potentials or channel closure. However, we found that the BK channel C-type inactivation occurred during hyper"

However, the impact of humidity on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes them more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms of dry air-induced disease severity and may lead to the development of strategies to reduce the impact of influenza virus infection in dry environments.

We also found that the settlement of Madagascar happened in a sex-biased way, with a higher probability of settlement from Africa than from Asia. Finally, we found that the genetic structure of the Malagasy population is already detectable after a few centuries, suggesting that the island is a unique place to study the effects of geography and time on human diversity."

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. We also found that the RNA base pairs with two genes, encoding enzymes involved in carbon utilization, and that the base pairing interferes with the RNA’s ability to repress the genes. These results demonstrate that the translation and base-pairing functions compete. This is an example of a dual-function RNA that has been overlooked in the past. We believe that this RNA is important for understanding the regulation of carbon utilization in bacteria."

Therefore, it is difficult to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of the role of behavioral flexibility in autism and may facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies. (PsycINFO Database Record"

In this study, we systematically investigated the impact of alkylated thymidine lesions on transcription. We found that the transcription reaction is stalled at the alkylated thymidine lesion, and the stalling is exacerbated by the proofreading activity of RNA polymerase II. We also found that the lesion can lead to multiple transcriptional bypass routes, which are controlled by different fidelity checkpoints. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from RNA polymerase II, which is involved in modulating the translocation of the alkylated DNA template. This work provides important mechanistic insights into the molecular mechanism of transcription stalling and mutagenesis. It is expected to provide a new direction for the development of new drugs for the treatment of diseases caused by DNA alkylation. (Show more)"

We also show that ROR1 is expressed in breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), and that treatment of mice bearing PDXs with the humanized anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab can reduce the number of PDXs and improve the response to chemotherapy. These results suggest that targeting ROR1 may improve the response to chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer. (Show more)"

This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection.

Here, we present an integrated proxy (C and uranium [U] isotopes and paleo CO2) and multicomponent modeling approach to investigate an abrupt C perturbation and global warming event (∼304 Ma) that occurred during a paleo-glacial state. We report pronounced negative C and U isotopic excursions coincident with a doubling of atmospheric CO2 partial pressure and a biodiversity nadir. The isotopic excursions can be linked to an injection of organic matter–derived C over 300 kyr and to near 20% of areal extent of seafloor anoxia. Earth system modeling indicates that widespread anoxic conditions can be linked to enhanced thermocline stratification and increased nutrient fluxes during this global warming within an icehouse. This work provides a new perspective on the role of organic matter in the Earth system and the potential for anoxia to play a key role in global warming. (Less)"

We show that the certification of palm oil plantations can reduce the rate of forest loss in these areas. However, certification has no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation."

However, the evolution of specialization is often considered a dead end, due to the constraints associated with the evolution of morphological and functional optimizations throughout the organism. Here we show that the evolution of siphonophore predators has been more flexible than previously thought, and that specialization can be maintained and even be linked to morphological evolution. Our findings contribute to understanding how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs. They also provide insights into the evolution of other predators, and may help to understand how the structure of food webs is shaped by the evolution of specialization."

The results have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. The results also highlight the need for a more holistic approach to food and nutrition security that considers the role of natural landscapes such as forests in meeting nutrition goals."

We show that the increase in vehicle weight has led to the propagation of compaction into deeper soil layers, which now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants.
