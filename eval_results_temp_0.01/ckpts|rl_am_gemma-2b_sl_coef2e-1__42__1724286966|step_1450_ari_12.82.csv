The evolutionary origin of this group has been elusive, but a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we present the first comparative genomic analysis of two distantly related myxozoan species, which are sister to a cnidarian parasite, and compare these to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the Myxozoa are a sister group to the Cnidaria. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The virus has a complex life cycle that includes a step in which it hijacks the nuclear import machinery to evade the antiviral action of interferon (IFN). Here, we show that the viral accessory protein Orf6 is responsible for this evasion mechanism. We also show that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 to block nuclear import of ISG mRNA.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1 channels. However, the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 channel. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding"

Earlier studies suggest that once the optimum growing temperature is exceeded, mean crop yields decline and the variability of yield increases even if interannual climate variability remains unchanged. Here, we use global datasets of maize production and climate variability combined with future temperature projections to quantify how yield variability will change in the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. We find that as the global mean temperature increases, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation (CV) of maize yields increases almost everywhere to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation (SD) of yields and a decrease in mean yields. For the top four maize-exporting countries, which account for 87% of global maize exports, the probability that they have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is largely unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa in the field. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammal species in semiarid African savanna. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers. Grass consumption was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of % grass consumption, indicating that RRA conveys reliable quantitative information about consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This study highlights the importance of diet composition and composition overlap in determining the extent to which species partition food resources."

No treatment is currently available to slow down the aggressive neurodegenerative process, and patients die within a few years after disease onset.

These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes.

TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. These data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This may have implications for the development of TRAP1-targeted therapies.

They are also the targets of the ADF/cofilin family of proteins, which are critical for the disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton. However, how ADF/cofilin acts on actin filaments in a physiological context, where filaments are interconnected and under mechanical stress, remains unclear. Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to study the action of ADF/cofilin in different mechanical situations. We find that local curvature favors severing, while tension has no effect on cofilin binding and weakly enhances severing. Remarkably, we observe that filament segments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist, experience a mechanical torque upon cofilin binding. We propose that this ADF/cofilin-induced torque increases the severing rate constant 100-fold. A consequence of this mechanism is that cross-linked filament networks are severed far more efficiently than nonconnected filaments. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. Our findings have implications for understanding the function of ADF/"

We used a grid-based approach to sample the genomic diversity across the island, allowing us to study the history of the settlement of Madagascar. We find that the Malagasy are a mixture of Bantu and Austronesian populations, with a limited contribution from Europe and the Middle East. The admixture happened recently, suggesting a rapid settlement of Madagascar during the last millennium. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, there are geographic influences on the present genomic diversity, independent of the admixture, showing that a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations.

Here, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others’ positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.

K+ channels commonly possess two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We induced C-type inactivation in BK channels and studied the relationship between activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery. We observed prominent slow C-type inactivation/recovery in BK channels by an extreme low concentration of extracellular K+ together with a Y294E/K/Q/S or Y279F mutation whose equivalent in Shaker channels (T449E/K/D/Q/S or W434F) caused a greatly accelerated rate of C-type inactivation or constitutive C-inactivation. C-type inactivation in most K+ channels occurs upon sustained membrane depolarization or channel opening and then recovers during hyperpolarized membrane potentials or channel closure. However, we found that the BK channel C-type inactivation occurred during hyperpolarized membrane potentials"

In temperate regions, seasonal outbreaks of influenza correlate with decreases in ambient humidity. However, the impact of humidity on host defense and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that mice housed in low humidity are more susceptible to severe disease following influenza virus infection. We find that low humidity impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

The operation applies equally to words and phrases of arbitrary complexity, and it is consistent with a bottom-up or left-corner parser of the incoming language stream. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases.

To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. First, whereas MERS-CoV prefers human DPP4 as its receptor, HKU4 shows the opposite trend. Second, in the absence of exogenous proteases, both MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes mediate pseudovirus entry into bat cells, whereas only MERS-CoV spike, but not HKU4 spike, mediates pseudovirus entry into human cells. Thus, MERS-CoV, but not HKU4, has adapted to use human cells for"

We identified a variety of vector-borne, zoonotic, and emerging pathogens, including chikungunya virus, Plasmodium knowlesi, and HIV. These findings are important for the early detection of undifferentiated febrile illness, the identification of emerging pathogens, and the deployment of rapid public health response.

In this paper, we introduce a computer vision method to measure changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods from time-series street-level imagery. We connect changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods with economic and demographic data and find that three factors predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects, and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Furthermore, we show that an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling can suppress the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Thus, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling. These results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This approach may be applicable to other types of cancer. (Read more)"

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The RNA encodes a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC) that interacts with aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (denoted GlpD) and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that the RNA base pairs with the cadA and galE promoters and that translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA. These results demonstrate that the translation and base-pairing functions compete. This is an example of a dual-function RNA that encodes a protein and base pairs with promoters.

However, the response of soil respiration to warming remains unclear, with some studies showing an increase in soil respiration with warming and others showing no change. Here, we present the largest global synthesis of soil respiration measurements to date, spanning nine biomes and 27 temperature manipulation studies. Our analysis provides limited evidence of acclimation of soil respiration to experimental warming in several major biome types, contrary to the results from multiple single-site studies. Moreover, across all biomes, respiration rates with and without experimental warming follow a Gaussian response, increasing with soil temperature up to a threshold of ∼25 °C, above which respiration rates decrease with further increases in temperature. This consistent decrease in temperature sensitivity at higher temperatures demonstrates that rising global temperatures may result in regionally variable responses in soil respiration, with colder climates being considerably more responsive to increased ambient temperatures compared with warmer regions. Our analysis adds a unique cross-biome perspective on the temperature response of soil respiration, information critical to improving our mechanistic understanding of how soil carbon dynamics change with climatic warming.

The etiology of autism is so complicated because it involves the effects of variants of several hundred risk genes along with the contribution of environmental factors. Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. Here, we show that the loss of function of five autism-risk gene homologs in Drosophila leads to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

We show that the release of aggregates requires active fusion of the cell membrane, demonstrating that the release of aggregates is an active process. These results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the spread of aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies. (Show more)"

However, our understanding of the factors that contribute to virus spillover from bats is very limited. Here, we identified and characterized an immunosuppressant protein (MTX) that is highly concentrated in the submandibular salivary gland of the bat, Myotis pilosus. This study provides deeper insight into immunologically privileged sites for microbial community residence in bats and supports the therapeutic potential of targeting MTX-LTA4H. This study also provides a deeper understanding of the role of LTA4H in the immune response of bats and the potential for LTA4H as a target for antiviral therapy.

The disease is caused by mutations in multiple genes, and the pathological hallmark of the disease is the presence of inclusions in the brain and spinal cord. These inclusions are composed of mutant proteins, which are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these proteins. Instead, the inclusions contain proteins that are supersaturated in the cell, but not when the average of all human tissues is considered. This suggests that the inclusions are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. This study provides a new perspective on the pathogenesis of ALS and suggests a potential therapeutic target. (PsycInfo Database Record"

We found that the transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis of alkylated DNA lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three alkylated DNA lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove alkylated DNA template. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove alkylated DNA template.

Their genome is segmented into eight RNA fragments, which offers evolutionary advantages but complicates genomic packaging. The existence of a selective packaging mechanism, in which one copy of each viral RNA is specifically packaged into each virion, is suspected, but its molecular details remain unknown. Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus. This interaction takes place in infected cells and is required for optimal viral replication. Disruption of this interaction decreased the amount of viral RNA in the viral particles, resulting in an eightfold increase in empty viral particles. This interaction is not widely conserved among influenza A viruses. The lack of conservation might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses. Our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of viral packaging and might contribute to the development of new influenza vaccines. (Show more)"

However, the economic and ecological costs of wildfire have risen dramatically in recent decades. Climate change has likely contributed to the increase in wildfire activity, but the direct role of people in increasing wildfire activity has been largely overlooked. We show that humans have vastly expanded the spatial and seasonal “fire niche” in the United States, accounting for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. Human-caused wildfires disproportionally occurred where fuel moisture was higher than lightning-started fires, thereby helping expand the geographic and seasonal niche of wildfire. Actions to raise awareness and increase management in regions prone to human-started wildfires should be a focus of United States policy to reduce fire risk and associated hazards.

In this paper, we introduce a computer vision method to measure changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods from time-series street-level imagery. We use this method to show that the physical appearances of neighborhoods matter for their economic and demographic outcomes. Specifically, we find that neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. We also find that neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

We demonstrate that the catabolism of amino acids during heat stress promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. This leads to an energy limitation of the coral host, which in turn promotes the degradation of the symbiosis.

Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. Our findings have important implications for the design of biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation strategies. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

But how do we know when we are connected? We asked people to talk with each other and rated their felt connection. We found that the speed at which people responded to each other predicted their felt connection. Within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Finally, we demonstrate that this signal is used by third-party listeners as a heuristic of how well people are connected. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"
