The structure of ice II is of great importance to the understanding of the origin of the high-pressure phase transition of water and the formation of hydrates. However, the structure of ice II has not been determined experimentally. In this work, we report the structure of ice II at high pressure and temperature. The structure of ice II is found to be a hydrate with the formula Ne·D2O. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. This finding provides a new route for the formation of hydrates. It also provides a new perspective for the study of the high-pressure phase transition of water.

Although the evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we compare the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. These results have implications for understanding the origin and evolution of parasitic lifestyles. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the host immune response and provides a potential target for antiviral therapy.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1.

We show that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields will increase almost everywhere as the global mean temperature increases. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. They also underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance."

However, despite decades of research, we still do not know how diverse assemblages of these species coexist. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species (six wild, one domestic) in semiarid African savanna. Our results suggest that the extent of diet overlap is greater between species that are similar in body size and proportional grass consumption, and that dietary composition differs between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity is sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These findings suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This work highlights the need for a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that drive coexistence in LMH assemblages. Such a synthesis may provide insights into the mechanisms that promote biodiversity in a world of limited resources."

This is due to the selective removal of the smaller plastic fragments by the ocean interior. This sink may be of major importance to understand the fate of the missing plastic debris."

We find that domestication and all forms of allocare correlate with increased fertility. All forms of provisioning correlate with larger litters without compromising offspring size. The greatest increase we observe in reproductive power is in species that practice allonursing.

The disease is characterized by the accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregates in affected oligodendrocytes. Several studies point to α-syn oligomerization and aggregation as a mediator of neurotoxicity in synucleinopathies including MSA. Here we show that the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 is able to limit the accumulation of α-syn in a mouse model of MSA. This effect is associated with a reduction of truncated α-syn and with neuroprotective effects. These results suggest that VX-765 is a promising candidate to achieve disease modification in synucleinopathies by limiting α-syn accumulation. This would be a major step forward in the treatment of this orphan disease.

The most widely used drugs for treating hypertension are the L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs). However, the use of LCCBs is associated with an increased risk of heart failure. Here, we show that LCCBs activate a store-operated Ca2+ entry pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells, which is mediated by the Ca2+ channel Cav1.2 and leads to up-regulation of the Ca2+ sensor protein STIM1. This pathway is important for the development of vascular remodeling in hypertension. Our findings provide a rationale for the use of LCCBs in patients with hypertension and cardiovascular remodeling. This study also suggests that LCCBs should be used with caution in patients with advanced age or advanced hypertension and/or cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated.

To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

Our analyses resolved controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, we found that plant cell wall-degrading enzymes obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, both major independent origins of specialized herbivory in beetles coincide with the first appearances of these genes in their genomes. We propose that these genes enabled efficient digestion of plant tissues, including lignocellulose in cell walls, facilitating the evolution of uniquely specialized plant-feeding habits, such as leaf mining and stem and wood boring. Beetle diversity thus appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of"

APOE is also a key protein in the classical complement cascade, which is involved in the clearance of senescent synapses. Here, we report a novel role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes. We also found that APOE alleles affect the rate of accumulation of complement-coated senescent synapses in the brain. These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes. They also suggest the hypothesis that APOE4 may be associated with defective phagocytic capacity of astrocytes, which accelerates the rate of accumulation of complement-coated senescent synapses, enhancing synaptic vulnerability to complement-mediated neurodegeneration. This hypothesis may help to explain the increased risk of AD in APOE4 carriers. These studies also provide a potential target for the development of new therapeutic strategies for AD."

However, the nucleation mechanism of the inner core is still unknown. Using a persistent embryo method and molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the metastable, body-centered, cubic phase of iron has a much higher nucleation rate than does the stable, hexagonal, close-packed phase under inner core conditions. This mechanism reduces the required undercooling of iron nucleation, which provides a key factor in solving the inner core nucleation paradox. The two-step nucleation scenario of the inner core also opens an avenue for understanding the structure and anisotropy of the present inner core.

The furin cleavage site within the spike protein was deleted from the viral genome for added safety of the vaccine strain. The vaccine is temperature sensitive in vitro yet grows robustly at the permissive temperature. In hamsters, the vaccine reduced lung viral loads, lung pathology, and weight loss. Upon challenge with wild-type virus, the vaccine protected hamsters from almost all SARS-CoV-2–associated weight loss. Highly attenuated COVI-VAC is protective at a single intranasal dose in a relevant in vivo model.

Here, we show that the evolution of brain size in amniotes is characterized by four major shifts in neuron–brain scaling. The most dramatic increases in brain neurons occurred independently with the appearance of birds and mammals, resulting in convergent neuron scaling in the two endothermic lineages. The other two major increases in the number of neurons happened in core land birds and anthropoid primates, which are two groups known for their cognitive prowess. Interestingly, relative brain size is associated with relative neuronal cell density in reptiles, birds, and primates but not in other mammals. This has important implications for studies using relative brain size as a proxy when looking for evolutionary drivers of animal cognition. This study also provides a new perspective on the evolution of brain size and the cognitive abilities of animals."

However, the function of TRAP1 in normal cells is less clear. We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This study provides a more complete understanding of the function of TRAP1 in cancer. It also suggests that TRAP1 may be a useful target for cancer therapy. (Read more)"

The virus replicates more efficiently at the cool temperatures found in the nasal cavity than at core body temperature. We show that mouse airway cells infected with mouse-adapted rhinovirus exhibit a striking enrichment in expression of antiviral defense response genes at 37 °C relative to 33 °C. This correlates with higher expression levels of type I and type III IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) at 37 °C. Temperature-dependent IFN induction in response to rhinovirus is dependent on the MAVS protein, a key signaling adaptor of the RIG-I–like receptors (RLRs). Stimulation of primary airway cells with the synthetic RLR ligand poly I:C leads to greater IFN induction at 37 °C relative to 33 °C at early time points poststimulation and to a sustained increase in the induction of ISGs at 37 °C relative to 33 °C. Genetic deficiency of MAVS or the type I IFN receptor in infected airway cells permits higher levels of viral replication, particularly at 37 °C, and partially rescues the temperature-dependent growth phenotype.

They open and close to allow ions to flow through the membrane. The K+ channel is the most abundant ion channel in the body. It is also the most studied ion channel. It is the only channel that has two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. We found that the BK channel’s activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery are closely related. We also found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation.

In temperate regions, seasonal outbreaks of influenza virus correlate with decreases in ambient humidity. While low humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes them more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our study provides insights into the impact of ambient humidity on host response to influenza infection and disease outcome.

This merge operation is applied equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity and is consistent with a neural implementation of a bottom-up or left-corner parser of the incoming language stream. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases.

These findings highlight the potential of well-managed grasslands to sequester carbon on a large scale and provide a pathway for climate-smart agriculture."

The resulting ranking of 887 viruses provides a comprehensive assessment of the zoonotic potential of wildlife viruses and can be used by policy makers and health scientists to inform research and public health interventions for prevention and rapid control of disease outbreaks. SpillOver is a living, interactive database that can be refined over time to continue to improve the quality and public availability of information on viral threats to human health.

The color of nectar is often used as an indicator of its chemical composition, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We show that the red color of the nectar of the plant Nesocodon mauritianus is derived from a previously undescribed alkaloid, nesocodin. We identify three enzymes that are necessary or sufficient for the production of this compound. We also identify nesocodin in the red nectar of the distantly related and hummingbird-visited Jaltomata herrerae and provide molecular evidence for convergent evolution of this trait. This work identifies a convergently evolved trait in two vertebrate-pollinated species, suggesting that the red pigment is selectively favored and that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation.

Our results indicate that the genetic ancestry of men is mostly derived from northern and central Europe, while women exhibit a very high genetic heterogeneity, including signals of genetic ancestry ranging from western Europe to East Asia. In addition, we found that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how HKU4 and HKU5 transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. First, whereas MERS-CoV prefers human DPP4 over bat DPP4 as its receptor, HKU4 shows the opposite trend. Second, in the absence of exogenous proteases, both MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes mediate pseudovirus entry into bat cells, whereas only MERS-CoV spike, but not HKU4 spike, mediates pseudovirus entry into human cells.

The improved polymerase ribozyme can synthesize a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and, in low yield, even tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR.

IBD is a major health problem, and the current treatment is limited. In this study, we found that retinoic acid-related orphan receptor α (RORα) plays an important role in the intestinal epithelium (IE) and is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis by attenuating nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcriptional activity. RORαΔIE-deficient mice exhibit excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IE. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis reveals corecruitment of RORα and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) on NF-κB target promoters and subsequent dismissal of CREB binding protein (CBP) and bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) for transcriptional repression. These results suggest that RORα/HDAC3-mediated attenuation of NF-κB signaling controls the balance"

There is an urgent need for novel and more efficient therapies, ideally targeting AML stem cells that are essential for maintaining the disease. We show here that monoclonal antibodies targeting the IL1RAP (IL1R3) receptor on candidate leukemic stem cells in the majority of AML patients have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action.

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GlpD) and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

Here, we present a model of the molecular evolution of plastid genomes under progressively relaxed functional constraints during the transition from autotrophy to a nonphotosynthetic parasitic lifestyle. We show that relaxed purifying selection in all plastid genes is linked to obligate parasitism, characterized by the parasite’s dependence on a host to fulfill its life cycle, rather than the loss of photosynthesis. Our findings suggest that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner. During the functional reduction process, the elevation of evolutionary rates reaches several new rate equilibria, possibly relating to the modified protein turnover rates in heterotrophic plastids. Our model may help to understand the molecular evolution of plastid genomes and their role in the origin of life. View Full-Text"

We use a high-resolution large ensemble to quantify the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the probability of occurrence of multiyear rainfall deficits in southwestern South Africa. We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the probability of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% by the year 2100 under an intermediate-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5) and to 80% under a high-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5-8.5). These results highlight the strong sensitivity of the drought risk in SSA to future anthropogenic emissions. This work is important for water resource management and climate change adaptation in SSA.

Neuroinflammation is also known to be associated with autoimmune diseases, such as EAE. Neuroinflammation is known to be regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase, ASK1. In this study, we found that ASK1 plays a critical role in the regulation of neuroinflammation in both the early and later stages of EAE. We also found that ASK1 in microglia/macrophages plays a major role in the generation and maintenance of neuroinflammation. Our findings suggest that ASK1 in microglia/macrophages is a promising therapeutic target for reducing neuroinflammation. This study also provides a better understanding of the mechanisms of neuroinflammation in EAE. These findings may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for neuroinflammation-related diseases. (PsycINFO Database Record"

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a starting point for understanding the etiology of autism and for developing new therapeutic approaches. (Show more)"

Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions in the brain and spinal cord are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. Rather, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

To better understand the mechanisms of MERS-CoV infection, we engineered viruses with mutations that blocked sequential proteolysis. These mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms of viral infection and may inform the development of antiviral strategies. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

This interface is critical for normal cell function and is also the site of many cancer-related processes. Here we use a combination of quantitative proteomics and glycoproteomics to study the surfaceome of a breast epithelial cell line stably expressing six of the most prominent oncogenes. We find that each oncogene has a different surfaceome, but that the functions of these proteins are harmonized by common biological themes including up-regulation of nutrient transporters, down-regulation of adhesion molecules and tumor suppressing phosphatases, and alteration in immune modulators. These studies provide a broad systems-level view of how specific driver oncogenes remodel the surfaceome and the glycoproteome in a cell autologous fashion, and suggest possible surface targets, and combinations thereof, for drug and biomarker discovery. This work also provides a resource for the breast cancer community to study the surfaceome of their own patient samples. (Show more)"

What are the effects of vote-by-mail? In this paper, we provide a comprehensive design-based analysis of the effect of universal vote-by-mail—a policy under which every voter is mailed a ballot in advance of the election—on electoral outcomes. We find that 1) universal vote-by-mail does not appear to affect either party’s share of turnout, 2) universal vote-by-mail does not appear to increase either party’s vote share, and 3) universal vote-by-mail modestly increases overall average turnout rates, in line with previous estimates. All three conclusions support the conventional wisdom of election administration experts and contradict many popular claims in the media. Our findings have important implications for the 2020 election and beyond."

Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus. This interaction is required for optimal viral replication and nonspecifically decreases the amount of viral RNA in the viral particles. Our experiments indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions. The lack of conservation of these interactions might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses. This study provides a better understanding of the packaging mechanism of influenza A viruses. It also provides a possible target for antiviral drug development. (Show more)"

However, the molecular mechanisms that control the ability to regenerate in the adult nervous system are poorly understood. Here, we identify a form of regeneration that is independent of the canonical MAPK signaling pathway and is triggered by physical lesion of the neuron. This form of regeneration is linked to a well-studied form of endogenous activity-dependent ectopic axon outgrowth in the same neuron type. These connections suggest that this form of regeneration represents a powerful platform for gene discovery in neuronal regeneration. Moreover, we note numerous similarities between this form of regeneration and conditioning of the adult nervous system’s ability to regenerate. Taken as a whole, our study unites disparate forms of neuronal outgrowth to uncover fresh molecular insights into activity-dependent control of the adult nervous system’s intrinsic regenerative capacity. This work may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of injury-induced loss of function in the nervous system. (Show more)"

We find that recombination is concentrated in regions of the genome called hotspots, and that these hotspots are distributed in a regular fashion across the genome. We also find that hotspots are concentrated in the promoter regions of genes. These results provide a detailed view of the distribution of recombination across the genome of a flowering plant.

Here, we show that the dominant resting metabolic network in healthy subjects is topologically similar to the default mode network. In Parkinson’s disease, this dominant network is subordinated to a disease-related pattern. Network functionality was assessed by quantifying the expression of the dominant network in healthy subjects and patients during rest and task performance. Network deactivation was reduced in early Parkinson’s disease, and this abnormality was partially corrected by dopaminergic therapy. Time-course comparisons of network loss in longitudinal resting metabolic scans from Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease subjects illustrated that significant reductions appeared later for Parkinson’s disease, in parallel with the development of cognitive dysfunction. In contrast, in Alzheimer’s disease significant reductions in network expression were already present at diagnosis, progressing over time. These results provide a new perspective on the organization of the brain and its functional changes in health and disease."

The role of fibrous sheath interacting protein 1 (FSIP1) in TNBC has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. This article is protected by copyright.

However, these factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects of biodiversity loss and environmental warming on ecosystem functioning. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. Our findings have implications for our ability to predict the impacts of climate change on ecosystem functioning. They also highlight the importance of considering the combined effects of biodiversity loss and environmental warming on ecosystem functioning. This is particularly relevant for the conservation of biodiversity and the sustainable use of ecosystems."

In many plants, flowering is induced by the FT protein, which is synthesized in leaves and travels to the shoot apex to induce flowering. Dodder is a root- and leafless plant that parasitizes a large number of autotrophic plants. Remarkably, some dodder species, e.g., Cuscuta australis, are able to synchronize their flowering with the flowering of their hosts. We show that the FT gene in dodder C. australis does not function in flowering induction. Instead, we demonstrate that host-synthesized FT signals are able to move into dodder stems, where they physically interact with a dodder FD transcription factor to activate dodder flowering. This study demonstrates that FTs can function as an important interplant flowering signal in host–dodder interactions. The unique means of flowering regulation of dodder illustrates how regressive evolution, commonly found in parasites, may facilitate the physiological synchronization of parasite and host, here allowing the C. australis parasite to time reproduction exactly with that of their hosts, likely optimizing parasite fitness.

But how do we know when two people are connected? We asked pairs of friends and strangers to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.” This may be important for understanding the evolution of social connection and for developing new technologies that can help us feel more connected."

The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) is the leading certification body for palm oil, and its certification is often required by major corporations and countries. However, the impact of certification on deforestation has been unclear. We show that certification is associated with reduced deforestation in Indonesia, but that most certified areas still contain substantial areas of peat and forest loss. Our results suggest that certification is not yet having the desired impact on deforestation and that certification alone is unlikely to be sufficient to meet the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement."

Its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. The exocyst complex is composed of 10 subunits, and the function of each subunit is not fully understood. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and offers a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

In many species, sex is determined by a single gene, but in others, multiple genes interact to determine sex. Here we investigate the effects of multiple interacting sex determination genes on secondary sexual characteristics in a species with multiple sex classes. We find that multiple sex determination genes can produce modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics, and that the modularity of secondary sexual characteristics can be used to understand the evolutionary causes and consequences of sex determination alleles in populations. This work provides a framework for understanding the evolution of sex determination in animals."

We sought to understand how Fe levels impact the retina, given that retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are also challenged by accumulations of reactive oxygen species-generating lipofuscin and photodegrading species. We found that Fe levels impact the retina by influencing the levels of reactive oxygen species-generating lipofuscin and photodegrading species. These findings have implications for the understanding of retinal disease and for the development of therapeutic strategies. (Read more)"

They are characterized by the use of specialized side branches (tentacles) armed with nematocysts for prey capture. This is a highly specialized mode of feeding, and the only one in the animal kingdom. We show that the evolution of this mode of feeding has been linked to the evolution of other morphological structures and functional traits. Our results suggest that the evolution of specialization in siphonophores has been driven by the evolution of morphological innovations and functional changes. These findings contribute to understanding the evolution of specialization in predators, and the evolution of morphological innovations in general."

This study provides the earliest evidence for the evolution of a key derived feature of the human hand, the third metacarpal styloid process. This fossil thus provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key shared derived characteristic of modern human and Neandertal hand morphology and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato. This study also provides a new perspective on the evolution of the human hand in the context of the broader hominin fossil record. (Read more)"

Mammals have both cytosolic SHMT1 and mitochondrial SHMT2, with the mitochondrial isozyme strongly up-regulated in cancer. Here we show that dual SHMT1/2 knockout blocks HCT-116 colon cancer tumor xenograft formation. We identify small-molecule dual inhibitors of human SHMT1/2, and show that they are effective cellular targets. We also show that formate generally rescues cells from SHMT inhibition, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of DLBCL. This work provides a foundation for the development of small-molecule inhibitors of SHMT1/2, and for the development of targeted therapies for cancer and lymphoma.

In addition, there is a growing concern about the impact of agricultural intensification on the environment. This study shows that deforestation can have a negative impact on people’s diets, and that this impact can be mitigated by the presence of forests. The results have important implications for policy makers, who should consider the role of natural landscapes in meeting nutrition goals, particularly in rural areas of low- and middle-income countries. The results also have implications for conservation, as forests are often overlooked in strategies to improve the environment. This study shows that forests can offer “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. This is an important contribution to the literature on the relationship between agriculture and the environment."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis calls for a rethinking of the role of large"
