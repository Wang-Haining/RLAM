The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The resolved structure where Ne dissolved in ice II is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. The density distributions indicate that the vibration of Ne atoms is mainly in planes perpendicular to D2O channels, whereas their distributions along the channels are further constrained by interactions between adjacent Ne atoms. The results provide a unique insight into the structure of the hydrate phase and the properties of the guest molecules. The results also provide a new perspective on the structure of the hydrate phase and the properties of the guest molecules.

Although the evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. To gain insight into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite, we compared the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the Myxozoa are a sister group to the cnidarians and that the Myxozoa are one of the most reduced animal lineages. The Myxozoa have one of the smallest reported animal genomes and lack key elements of signaling pathways and transcriptional factors important for multicellular development. These results have important implications for understanding the origin and evolution of parasitism. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. Sperm cells are quiescent in the male reproductive system due to Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1 channels, but become active once introduced into the low-Zn2+-concentration environment of the female reproductive tract. How Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide"

This will be challenging because of the projected increase in global mean temperatures. We quantify how the variability of maize production will change in the major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. We find that the probability of simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year increases from 0% to 7% under 2 °C warming and to 86% under 4 °C warming. This increase in instability will affect especially the 800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. Our results highlight the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance. This is especially important because the projected increase in temperature variability is likely to be more severe than the increase in mean temperature.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because of the difficulty of species-level identification of plant remains in traditional methods. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large herbivore species in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results highlight the need to consider the full taxonomic diversity of species interacting with a system, and to consider the potential for species to partition resources at finer taxonomic levels than previously thought. This is particularly important in light of the current global trend toward increasing biodiversity. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The effective CPUE of most countries has decreased since 1950, showing the increasing pressure of fisheries on ocean resources. The effective CPUE of most countries in 2015 was a fifth of its 1950s value, which was compared with a global decline in abundance. There are signs, however, of stabilization and more effective management in recent years, with a reduction in fleet sizes in developed countries. Based on historical patterns and allowing for the slowing rate of expansion, 1 million more motorized vessels could join the global fleet by midcentury as developing countries continue to transition away from subsistence fisheries. This would challenge sustainable use of fisheries' resources. The global fishing fleet is a major contributor to ocean noise and pollution. The expansion of the motorized fleet has been driven by the powered-artisanal sector, which is largely unregulated.

This resistance is mediated by sustained activation of the mTORC1 signaling axis, which in turn activates sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. We show that targeting mTORC1 sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis induction, and that targeting SREBP1 or SCD1, two transcriptional targets of SREBP1, restores ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells. In addition, we show that combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction results in near-complete tumor regression in preclinical models. These findings suggest that mTORC1 inhibition may be combined with ferroptosis induction to treat cancer patients with PI3K-mutated breast cancer or PTEN-defective prostate cancer. This combination therapy may be particularly effective in patients with high-grade tumors. (Read more)"

The most common drugs for treating hypertension are L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs). LCCBs are major drugs for treating hypertension, the preeminent risk factor for heart failure. Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) remodeling is a pathological hallmark of chronic hypertension. VSMC remodeling is characterized by molecular rewiring of the cellular Ca2+ signaling machinery, including down-regulation of Ca2+ channels and up-regulation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stromal-interacting molecule (STIM) Ca2+ sensor proteins and the plasma membrane ORAI Ca2+ channels. STIM/ORAI proteins drive fibro-proliferative gene programs during cardiovascular remodeling. LCCBs act on the STIM N terminus to cause STIM relocalization to junctions and subsequent ORAI activation in a Cav1.2-independent and store depletion-independent manner. LCCB-induced promotion of VSMC remodeling requires STIM1, which is up-regulated in VSMCs from hypertensive rats. Epidemiology showed that LCCBs are more associated with heart failure than other antihypertensive drugs in patients. Our data unravel a"

We show that the NWFP halted the decline of older-forest–associated bird populations, but not early-seral–associated species. The NWFP’s success is partly explained by the fact that older forests are more difficult to clearcut than early-seral forests. However, the NWFP’s success is also due to the fact that older forests are more resilient to fire. We conclude that the NWFP has not yet achieved its goal of reversing the decline of older-forest–associated bird populations. We also show that the creation of early-seral ecosystems on federal land may be a useful tool for conserving early-seral bird populations. However, the NWFP’s focus on early-seral ecosystems may impede the development of older-forest structure. Thus, the NWFP needs to be complemented by policies that promote the development of older forests. Our findings highlight the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP."

We present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

Over the Quaternary, we observe dramatic shifts in effective moisture, resulting in large-scale changes in one of the world’s largest lakes and most diverse freshwater ecosystems. Results show evidence for 24 lake level drops of more than 200 m during the Late Quaternary, including 15 lowstands when water levels were more than 400 m lower than modern. A dramatic shift is observed at the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT), consistent with far-field climate forcing, which separates vastly different hydroclimate regimes before and after ∼800,000 years ago.

CTLA-4 deletion induced preferential expansion of Treg cells, but this was not sufficient to prevent the development of autoimmunity. CTLA-4 deletion in adult mice had opposing impacts on different autoimmune models. Thus, although CTLA-4 deficiency affected both central and peripheral tolerance, it was not sufficient to prevent the development of autoimmunity.

We used a comprehensive dataset of 89 genes to estimate the timing and rates of beetle diversification. We also traced the evolution of genes enabling symbiont-independent digestion of lignocellulose, the major component of plant cell walls, using 154 genomes or transcriptomes. Phylogenomic analyses of these uniquely comprehensive datasets resolved previously controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, corresponding (Jurassic) diversification rate increases suggest that these novel genes triggered adaptive radiations that resulted in nearly half of all living beetle species. We propose that beetles diversified due to low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding plant cell wall-degrading enzymes.

Our work opens the door to the study of entanglement dynamics in a wide class of quantum systems. It also provides a powerful tool to study the thermodynamics of quantum systems."

We describe a vaccine that is effective, safe, and easy to manufacture. This vaccine is based on a live attenuated SARS-CoV-2 strain that is temperature sensitive in vitro but grows robustly at the human body temperature. This vaccine is also easy to manufacture, as it does not require the use of recombinant proteins or viral vectors. We show that this vaccine is protective in hamsters.

It is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis and can spread by multiple transmission pathways. Today, most human plague cases are caused by inhalation of infectious droplets, but the historical spread of plague in Europe is poorly understood. Here, we describe a compartmental model for plague transmission by a human ectoparasite vector. Using Bayesian inference, we found that this model fits mortality curves from nine outbreaks in Europe better than models for rodent or pneumonic transmission. Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346–1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats.

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal and transformed cells is more complex than previously appreciated. We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This study provides a mechanistic explanation for the role of TRAP1 as a tumor suppressor and suggests that TRAP1-directed therapeutic strategies may be more effective in some settings. This study"

It does so by binding to the barbed end of actin filaments and severing them. However, how it does so in a physiological context, where filaments are interconnected and under mechanical stress, remains unclear. Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to study the action of ADF in different mechanical situations. We find that local curvature favors severing, while tension surprisingly has no effect on ADF binding and weakly enhances severing. Remarkably, we observe that filament segments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist, experience a mechanical torque upon ADF binding. We find that this ADF-induced torque dramatically enhances severing. A simple model, which faithfully recapitulates our experimental observations, indicates that the ADF-induced torque increases the severing rate constant 100-fold. A consequence of this mechanism is that cross-linked filament networks are severed by cofilin far more efficiently than nonconnected filaments. We propose that this mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. This mechanism may be important in"

We found that mouse airway cells infected with mouse-adapted rhinovirus exhibit a striking enrichment in expression of antiviral defense response genes at 37 °C relative to 33 °C. This correlates with significantly higher expression levels of type I and type III IFN genes and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) at 37 °C.

In this study, we show that the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa detects contact with surfaces on short timescales using the mechanical activity of its type IV pili, a major surface adhesin. This signal transduction mechanism requires attachment of type IV pili to a solid surface, followed by pilus retraction and signal transduction through the Chp chemosensory system, a chemotaxis-like sensory system that regulates cAMP production and transcription of hundreds of genes, including key virulence factors. Our results thus support a mechanochemical model where a chemosensory system measures the mechanically induced conformational changes in stretched type IV pili. These findings demonstrate that P. aeruginosa not only uses type IV pili for surface-specific twitching motility, but also as a sensor regulating surface-induced gene expression and pathogenicity. This work provides a mechanistic understanding of how bacteria sense and respond to their environment. It also has implications for the development of new antibiotics that target type IV pili.

Importantly, we identify an inflammatory profile unique to Aβ-burdened neurons, since neighboring glial cells did not express similar molecules. Moreover, we show that a neuron-specific inflammatory response may precede insoluble Aβ plaque and tau tangle formation in the human brain.

Here, we show that the RNA pyrophosphohydrolase RppH, which is normally inactive in the absence of alarmones, becomes active in the presence of stress. We show that RppH decapsulates alarmones by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to decapsulate other RNAs.

However, a global, quantitative view of how the biomass of different taxa compare with one another is still lacking. Here, we assemble the overall biomass composition of the biosphere, establishing a census of the ≈550 Gt C of biomass distributed among all of the kingdoms of life. We show that the biomass of humans is an order of magnitude higher than that of all wild mammals combined. We also highlight the historical impact of humanity on the global biomass of prominent taxa, including mammals, fish, and plants. Our analysis reveals that the global marine biomass pyramid contains more consumers than producers, thus increasing the scope of previous observations on inverse food pyramids. Finally, we highlight that the mass of humans is an order of magnitude higher than that of all wild mammals combined.

In this study, we use proteomics to characterize the posttesticular life history of the Drosophila sperm proteome and determine the extent of molecular continuity between males and females. We show that the sperm proteome undergoes substantial compositional changes after being transferred to the female reproductive tract. Multiple seminal fluid proteins initially associate with sperm, but most become undetectable after sperm are stored. Female-derived proteins also begin to associate with sperm immediately after mating, and they comprise nearly 20% of the postmating sperm proteome following 4 d of storage in the female reproductive tract. Female-derived proteins that associate with sperm are enriched for processes associated with energy metabolism, suggesting that female contributions support sperm viability during the prolonged period between copulation and fertilization.

This mechanism is important for the pathophysiology of VWD. The conversion of single molecule kon (s−1) to bulk phase kon (s−1M−1) and the kon and koff values extrapolated to zero force for the low-force pathways show remarkably good agreement with bulk-phase measurements.

We here present a method for reconstructing ancient surface temperatures based on the thermostability of ancestral enzymes. Our results suggest that Earth’s surface temperature decreased over geological time from ∼65–80 °C in the Archean, a finding consistent both with previous isotope-based and protein reconstruction-based interpretations.

The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally shows no C-type inactivation. We induced C-type inactivation in BK channels and studied the relationship between activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery. We observed prominent slow C-type inactivation/recovery in BK channels by an extreme low concentration of extracellular K+ together with a Y294E/K/Q/S or Y279F mutation whose equivalent in Shaker channels (T449E/K/D/Q/S or W434F) caused a greatly accelerated rate of C-type inactivation or constitutive C-inactivation.

In the temperate regions, seasonal influenza outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in ambient humidity. While low humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

However, whether and how the brain builds such structures remains largely unknown. Here, we used intracranial recordings to investigate how left-hemispheric brain activity varies during the formation of phrase structures. We found that high-gamma power increased with each successive word in a sentence but decreased suddenly whenever words could be merged into a phrase. This merge operation was applied equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity. More superficial models of language, based solely on sequential transition probability over lexical and syntactic categories, only captured activity in the posterior middle temporal gyrus. Formal model comparison indicated that the model of multiword phrase construction provided a better fit than probability-based models at most sites in superior temporal and inferior frontal cortices. Activity in those regions was consistent with a neural implementation of a bottom-up or left-corner parser of the incoming language stream. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases.

We find that the spider’s web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to capture the sound-induced air particle movements that approach the maximum physical efficiency better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By sensing the motion of web threads, the spider remotely detects and localizes the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave, such as those emitted by approaching prey or predators. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider"

We find that a phaseout of fossil fuel use alone can avoid an excess mortality rate of 3.61 million per year worldwide, and 5.55 million per year by additionally controlling nonfossil anthropogenic sources. This is equivalent to 10–70% more rainfall over densely populated regions in India and 10–30% more over Central America, West Africa, and the Sahel, thus contributing to water and food security. Since aerosols mask the anthropogenic rise in global temperature, removing pollution particles liberates 0.51 °C globally. We conclude that a rapid phaseout of fossil fuel use and major reductions of other anthropogenic sources are needed to save millions of lives, restore aerosol-perturbed rainfall patterns, and limit global warming to 2 °C.

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, HM predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. HM was associated with less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia, but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors. The findings highlight the importance of psychological examinations of masculinity as a cultural ideology to understand how men’s and women’s endorsement of HM legitimizes patriarchal dominance and reinforces gender, race, and class-based hierarchies via candidate support.

Using data from virus discovery projects and public records of virus detections around the world, we ranked the spillover potential of 887 wildlife viruses. Validating the risk assessment, the top 12 were known zoonotic viruses. The SpillOver platform can be used by policy makers and health scientists to inform research and public health interventions for prevention and rapid control of disease outbreaks.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how HKU4 and HKU5 transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences.

The short-tailed bird group Pygostylia is a major evolutionary lineage that is thought to have contributed to the development of the modern avian bauplan. However, the currently limited known diversity of early branching members of Pygostylia obscures our understanding of this major transition in avian evolution. Here, we describe a basal member of Pygostylia, Jinguofortis perplexus, from the Early Cretaceous of China. This new taxon adds important information about the evolution of the short-tailed bird group. The discovery of Jinguofortis increases the known ecomorphological diversity of basal pygostylians and highlights the importance of developmental plasticity for understanding mosaic evolution in early birds.

This comes from analysis of observations showing that stratospheric water vapor increases with tropospheric temperature, implying the existence of a stratospheric water vapor feedback. We estimate the strength of this feedback in a chemistry–climate model to be +0.3 W/(m2⋅K), which would be a significant contributor to the overall climate sensitivity. One-third of this feedback comes from increases in water vapor entering the stratosphere through the tropical tropopause layer, with the rest coming from increases in water vapor entering through the extratropical tropopause.

The color of an animal can be used to communicate with conspecifics, to avoid predation, or to blend in with the environment. In this study, we show that the color of anurans (frogs and toads) can be modulated by the presence of a unique group of proteins that bind biliverdin, a pigment that is normally found in the blood. Our results provide a molecular and functional explanation for the evolution of blue-green coloration in anurans and suggest a mechanism for the evolution of color in vertebrates.

ALKBH5 expression is induced by hypoxia, and hypoxia promotes enrichment of BCSCs in the tumor microenvironment. Our findings suggest that HIF-dependent ALKBH5 expression may be a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatment. This is particularly relevant for triple-negative breast cancer, which is highly aggressive and lacks effective treatment options.

The source of the parchment, often called “uterine vellum,” has been a long-standing controversy in codicology. Use of the Latin term abortivum in many sources has led some scholars to suggest that fetal calves or sheep skins were used. Others have argued that it would not be possible to sustain herds if so many pocket Bibles were made from fetal skins, arguing instead for unexpected alternatives, such as rabbit. Here, we report a simple and objective method using standard conservation treatments to identify the animal origin of parchment. The noninvasive method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals; however, we did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides.

The age model for this event is critical for understanding its cause and the controls on extinction/recovery dynamics. We present a precise age model for the Permian-Triassic boundary based on U-Pb dating of volcanic ash beds. The extinction occurred between 251.941 ± 0.037 and 251.880 ± 0.031 Mya, an interval of 60 ± 48 ka. Onset of a major reorganization of the carbon cycle immediately precedes the initiation of extinction and is punctuated by a sharp (3‰), short-lived negative spike in the isotopic composition of carbonate carbon. Carbon cycle volatility persists for ∼500 ka before a return to near preextinction values. Decamillenial to millennial level resolution of the mass extinction and its aftermath will permit a refined evaluation of the relative roles of rate-dependent processes contributing to the extinction, allowing insight into postextinction ecosystem expansion. This age model will also be critical for evaluating the plausibility of trigger and kill mechanisms. This article is"

Here, we generate intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific RORα-deficient (RORαΔIEC) mice and find that RORα is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis by attenuating nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcriptional activity. RORαΔIEC mice exhibit excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis reveals corecruitment of RORα and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) on NF-κB target promoters and subsequent dismissal of CREB binding protein (CBP) and bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) for transcriptional repression.

We show that chitin is provided to the squid only at dusk, when the symbiotic organ is at its most stable. We also show that the glycan is catabolized by the symbionts, whose activity is required for the squid to maintain a stable symbiosis.

This epidemic marked the start of the second plague pandemic, which lasted in Europe until the early 19th century. This pandemic is generally understood as the consequence of a singular introduction of Yersinia pestis, after which the disease established itself in European rodents over four centuries. To locate these putative plague reservoirs, we studied the climate fluctuations that preceded regional plague epidemics, based on a dataset of 7,711 georeferenced historical plague outbreaks and 15 annually resolved tree-ring records from Europe and Asia. We provide evidence for repeated climate-driven reintroductions of the bacterium into European harbors from reservoirs in Asia, with a delay of 15 ± 1 y. Our analysis finds no support for the existence of permanent plague reservoirs in medieval Europe.

The survival rate of AML patients is low, and there is an urgent need for novel and more efficient therapies. We show here that monoclonal antibodies targeting the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML.

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

Many neutralizing antibodies, including some approved for emergency use authorization (EUA), reduced or lost activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants. Here, we introduce a geometric deep learning algorithm that efficiently enhances antibody affinity to achieve broader and more potent neutralizing activity against such variants. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a human antibody P36-5D2, which is effective against SARS-CoV-2 Alpha, Beta, and Gamma but not Delta. We show that our approach can identify CDR changes that alleviate the impact of two Omicron mutations on the epitope. These results highlight the power of our deep learning approach in antibody optimization and its potential application to engineering other protein molecules. Our optimized antibodies can potentially be developed into antibody drug candidates for current and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants."

We show that the underlying models that describe the reported crop status are statistically robust and maintain similar characteristics across different crops, exhibit long-term stability, and have nation-wide validity. We propose a quantitative Crop Condition Index based on the CPC survey and demonstrate how this index can be used to monitor crop status and provide earlier and more precise predictions of crop yields than official USDA forecasts released midseason. Our results show that the CPC survey is a valuable source of information that can be used to monitor crop status and provide early warnings of crop anomalies. This information can be used to improve the accuracy of crop yield forecasts and to support agricultural decision-making. Our findings have implications for agricultural monitoring and forecasting, and for the design of other large-scale surveys. Our approach can be extended to other crops and countries."

This is thought to be accomplished through sustained, elevated neural activity. However, other work has argued that short-term synaptic facilitation can serve as a substrate of memory. Here we propose a mechanism where memory is supported by intrinsic plasticity that downregulates neuronal firing rates. We show that this adaptive change in excitability provides memory on timescales ranging from milliseconds to seconds. From these variables, information is continuously read back into the active membrane state for processing. This mechanism is sensitive to context and serial order which makes it suitable for temporal integration in sequence processing within the language domain. We demonstrate that it is sensitive to context and serial order which makes it suitable for temporal integration in sequence processing within the language domain. This work provides a step toward a computational neurobiology of language."

We synthesize the largest global dataset to date of soil respiration, moisture, and temperature measurements, totaling &gt;3,800 observations representing 27 temperature manipulation studies, spanning nine biomes and over 2 decades of warming. Our analysis reveals no significant differences in the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration between control and warmed plots in all biomes, with the exception of deserts and boreal forests. Thus, our data provide limited evidence of acclimation of soil respiration to experimental warming in several major biome types, contrary to the results from multiple single-site studies. Our analysis adds a unique cross-biome perspective on the temperature response of soil respiration, information critical to improving our mechanistic understanding of how soil carbon dynamics change with climatic warming.

It is also one of the most difficult to study, as it is marked by a gradual change in the selective pressure on the genome. We present a model of the trajectory of plastid genome evolution during the transition from autotrophy to a nonphotosynthetic parasitic lifestyle. We show that the loss of photosynthesis is linked to the parasite’s dependence on a host to fulfill its life cycle, rather than the loss of photosynthesis. Our findings suggest that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner. During the functional reduction process, the elevation of evolutionary rates reaches several new rate equilibria, possibly relating to the modified protein turnover rates in heterotrophic plastids. This study provides a unique view into the molecular evolution of the plastid genome, which is the site of many of the most important metabolic innovations in the history of life. It also provides a framework for understanding the molecular evolution of other genomes under progressively relaxed functional constraints. This article is protected by copyright.

We use a high-resolution climate model to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the probability of occurrence of multiyear rainfall deficits in southwestern South Africa. We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 80% by the year 2100 under high-emission scenarios. These results highlight the strong sensitivity of the drought risk in SSA to future anthropogenic emissions.

Neuroinflammation is associated with the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) ASK1. In this study, we found that ASK1 in microglia/macrophages plays a major role in generating and maintaining disease during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). ASK1 deficiency in T cells and dendritic cells had no significant effects on EAE severity. Activated astrocytes produce key inflammatory mediators, including CCL2, that further activated and recruited microglia/macrophages, in an astrocytic ASK1-dependent manner. Astrocyte-specific analysis revealed CCL2 expression was higher in the later stage compared with the early stage, suggesting a greater proinflammatory role of astrocytes in the later stage. Our findings demonstrate cell-type–specific roles of ASK1 and suggest phase-specific ASK1-dependent glial cell interactions in EAE pathophysiology.

The drought began in 2012 and now includes the lowest calendar-year and 12-mo precipitation, the highest annual temperature, and the most extreme drought indicators on record. The extremely warm and dry conditions have led to acute water shortages, groundwater overdraft, critically low streamflow, and enhanced wildfire risk. We find that precipitation deficits that occurred when conditions were warm were more than twice as likely to yield drought years. We also find that the probability of drought has increased in the past two decades. Finally, we show that anthropogenic warming has increased the probability that dry precipitation years are also extremely warm. These findings suggest that anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of co-occurring warm–dry conditions like those that have created the acute human and ecosystem impacts associated with the “exceptional” 2012–2014 drought in California.

The etiology of autism is so complicated because it involves the effects of variants of several hundred risk genes along with the contribution of environmental factors. Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. As an alternative approach, extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying the convergence of the targets and functions of the autism-risk genes to facilitate mapping out causal paths. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that the reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the converging functions of autism-risk genes and may facilitate the development of therapeutic strategies for autism.

However, recent evidence from other neurodegenerative disorders suggests that disease-affected biochemical pathways can be characterized by the presence of proteins that are supersaturated, with cellular concentrations significantly greater than their solubilities. We show that the proteins that form inclusions of mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), TDP-43, and fused in sarcoma (FUS) are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. To explain the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in the brain and spinal cord, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues.

The morphology and anatomy of the plant, including aspects of its reproduction, suggest that Montsechia is sister to Ceratophyllum (whenever cladistic analyses are made with or without a backbone). Montsechia was an aquatic angiosperm living and reproducing below the surface of the water, similar to Ceratophyllum. Montsechia is Barremian in age, raising questions about the very early divergence of the Ceratophyllum clade compared with its position as sister to eudicots in many cladistic analyses.

The most recent common ancestor of all B19V has been dated to the early 1800s, and it has been suggested that genotype 1, the most common B19V genotype, only started circulating in the 1960s. Here we present 10 ancient B19V genomes (∼0.5–6.9 kya) from Eurasia and Greenland. We find that the most recent common ancestor of all B19V is placed ∼12.6 kya, and we are able to date the recombination event between genotypes 1 and 3 that formed genotype 2 to ∼5.0–6.8 kya.

We observed distinct pol II stalling profiles for the three regioisomeric EtdT lesions.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas the more rigid uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into"

Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus using in vitro experiments. Using silent trans-complementary mutants, we then demonstrated that this interaction takes place in infected cells and is required for optimal viral replication. Disruption of this interaction did not affect the HA titer of the mutant viruses, suggesting that the same amount of viral particles was produced. However, it nonspecifically decreased the amount of viral RNA in the viral particles, resulting in an eightfold increase in empty viral particles.

Chemotherapy is the most common treatment for breast cancer, but resistance to chemotherapy is a major problem. We found that the type I tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor ROR1 is expressed in breast cancer cells following treatment with chemotherapy. ROR1 expression is associated with the activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, and BMI1, which are important in the regulation of stemness. ROR1 expression also enhances the capacity of breast cancer cells to metastasize and to reestablish tumors in mice.

Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

The disease is associated with a loss of dopamine-containing neurons and a reduction in the dopamine-producing capacity of the remaining neurons. The present study shows that the dopamine-producing neurons are connected to a specialized system of neurons in the striatum. These striatonigral neurons are themselves connected to a system of striosome–dendron bouquets. The striosome–dendron bouquets are a specialized system of neurons that are likely to be critical to the function of the dopamine system in health and disease.

But how do we know when two people are connected? We asked people to talk with each other and rated their felt connection. We found that the speed at which people responded to each other was a robust predictor of felt connection. People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.” This is a fundamental insight into the nature of social connection."

However, the mechanisms that govern SAN function are not fully understood. Here, we report that stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is expressed in SANCs and is required for the maintenance of SAN function. We show that STIM1 regulates the electrical activity of SANCs by modulating the activity of store-operated Ca2+ entry and the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. These studies reveal a previously unknown mechanism by which STIM1 regulates SAN function. Our findings have important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of heart failure, which is often associated with SAN dysfunction. (PsycINFO Database Record"

Although the function of Si in plant physiology has been well documented, its beneficial effects on plant resistance against insect herbivory have been less well studied. In this study, we show that Si pretreatment enhances rice resistance against the rice leaffolder in wild-type rice plants but not in plants with RNAi-mediated gene silencing of jasmonate biosynthesis and perception genes. This interaction between Si and jasmonates is likely mediated by jasmonates, as Si pretreatment enhanced rice resistance against the rice leaffolder in plants with RNAi-mediated silencing of the jasmonate ZIM-domain proteins OsZIM1 and OsZIM2. These results suggest that silicon may be used as a biocontrol agent to enhance plant resistance against insect herbivory.

This is due to the cell wall, which is absent in mammalian cells and poses the dominant physical barrier to biomolecule delivery in plants. Herein, we report a systematic assessment of different DNA nanostructures for their ability to internalize into cells of mature plants, deliver siRNAs, and effectively silence a constitutively expressed gene in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. We show that nanostructure internalization into plant cells and corresponding gene silencing efficiency depends on the nanostructure size, shape, compactness, stiffness, and location of the siRNA attachment locus on the nanostructure. We further confirm that the internalization efficiency of DNA nanostructures correlates with their respective gene silencing efficiencies but that the endogenous gene silencing pathway depends on the siRNA attachment locus. Our work establishes the feasibility of biomolecule delivery to plants with DNA nanostructures and both details the design parameters of importance for plant cell internalization and also assesses the impact of DNA nanostructure geometry for gene silencing mechanisms.

Based on local field potential recordings in a mouse model, we first validate a dynamic causal model of NMDAR-Ab effects on cortical microcircuitry. Using this model, we then identify the key synaptic parameters that best explain EEG paroxysms in pediatric patients with NMDAR-Ab encephalitis. Finally, we use the mouse model to show that NMDAR-Ab–related changes render microcircuitry critically susceptible to overt EEG paroxysms when these key parameters are changed, even though the same parameter fluctuations are tolerated in the in silico model of the control condition. These findings offer mechanistic insights into circuit-level dysfunction induced by NMDAR-Abs. This work may help to inform the development of new therapeutic strategies"
