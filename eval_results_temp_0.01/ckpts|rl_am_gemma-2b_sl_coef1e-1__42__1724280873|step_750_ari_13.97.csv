However, this description is not mathematically precise. In this paper, we provide a precise mathematical description of quantum theory in terms of continuous linear functionals on appropriate spaces of states. This description is based on a categorical construction that we call the “algebraic description of quantum theory.” The algebraic description of quantum theory is a category whose objects are algebras of observables and whose morphisms are states. The category is equivalent to the category of continuous linear functionals on the appropriate spaces of states. This equivalence is a mathematical reformulation of the operational meaning of quantum theory."

Here, we present a comparative analysis of the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species and a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results show that the myxozoan genome is one of the smallest reported in animals and that the myxozoan body plan is reduced to a simple structure, the polar capsule. We also show that myxozoans are a sister group to the cnidarians and that the transition from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic myxozoan was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content.

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We found that SARS-CoV-2 Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 evades the host immune response and highlights a potential target for antiviral therapy.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1.

However, the extent to which species differ in their food-resource use is largely unknown because of the difficulty of species-level identification of food resources. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify the food resources consumed by seven abundant species of large herbivores in semiarid African savanna. We found that the degree of overlap in food-resource use was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, species differed in their food-resource use, and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore communities. Our results also suggest that L megaherbivore diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This may have important implications for the management of large herbivore communities."

We determined the ages of 40 large presolar silicon carbide grains extracted from the Murchison CM2 meteorite. The grains have interstellar lifetimes of &lt;300 Ma, which is shorter than theoretical estimates for large grains. We also determined that at least 12 of the analyzed grains were parts of aggregates in the interstellar medium. The grains acquired the bulk of their cosmogenic nuclides in the interstellar medium and not by exposure to an enhanced particle flux of the early active sun. The results provide evidence for an early episode of enhanced star formation ∼7 Ga ago.

This suggests that the limiting factor on reproductive output in placental mammals is the mother’s own metabolic power. This is important because it suggests that the evolution of reproductive output is largely determined by the mother’s physiology and not by the environment.

Several studies point to α-syn oligomerization and aggregation as a mediator of neurotoxicity in synucleinopathies including MSA. We present here an in vivo proof of concept of the ability of the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 to mitigate α-syn pathology and to mediate neuroprotection in a mouse model of MSA. VX-765 prevented motor deficits and preserved tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in the substantia nigra.

Here we show that trait anxiety directly influences social dominance in male outbred rats and identify an important mediating role for mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens. High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low-anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as decreased ATP and increased ROS production in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals.

In this study, we found that activating mutation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) function, highly frequent events in human cancer, confers ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells. This resistance requires sustained activation of mTORC1 and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)C1-dependent induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. Furthermore, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a transcriptional target of SREBP1, mediates the ferroptosis-suppressing activity of SREBP1 by producing monounsaturated fatty acids. Genetic or pharmacologic ablation of SREBP1 or SCD1 sensitized ferroptosis in cancer cells with PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway mutation. Conversely, ectopic expression of SREPB1 or SCD1 restored ferroptosis resistance in these cells, even when mTORC1 was inhibited. In"

The underlying mechanisms of hypertension are complex and include the vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotype. VSMCs are the main cells in the blood vessel wall and play a critical role in the development of hypertension. We show that the three major classes of L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs) activate STIM/ORAI-mediated Ca2+ entry in VSMCs. LCCBs act on the STIM N terminus to cause STIM relocalization to junctions and subsequent ORAI activation in a Cav1.2-independent and store depletion-independent manner. LCCB-induced promotion of VSMC remodeling requires STIM1, which is up-regulated in VSMCs from hypertensive rats. Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. Our findings unravel a mechanism of LCCBs action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. This study provides a rationale for the use of LCCBs"

We show that the best candidate designed by us is up to 56 times more active than telithromycin, a clinically used antibiotic, and is more active than the best compound identified by a previous experimental approach. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

We used a comprehensive dataset of 89 genes to estimate the timing and rates of beetle diversification, and a comprehensive dataset of 154 genomes or transcriptomes to trace the evolution of genes enabling symbiont-independent digestion of plant cell walls. Phylogenomic analyses of these datasets resolved controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, corresponding (Jurassic) diversification rate increases suggest that these novel genes triggered adaptive radiations that resulted in the unique feeding habits of specialized herbivorous beetles. We propose that these genes enabled efficient digestion of plant tissues, including lignocellulose in cell walls, facilitating the evolution of uniquely specialized plant-feeding habits, such as leaf mining and stem and wood boring. Beetle diversity thus appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding PCWDEs.

The vaccine candidate is highly attenuated, and the viral load in the lungs is reduced by more than 100-fold compared to the wild-type virus. In addition, the vaccine candidate induces high levels of neutralizing antibodies and protection against challenge with the wild-type virus. This vaccine candidate has the potential to be used in mass vaccination programs. (Show more)"

The vector of plague during this period is unknown, but it is thought to have been spread by rats. Here, we present a mathematical model for plague transmission by a human ectoparasite vector. We show that this model fits mortality curves from nine outbreaks in Europe better than models for rodent transmission. Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346–1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats. This work also provides a framework for studying the historical spread of plague in Europe. Future work should focus on the development of models for rodent transmission. This will allow us to understand the interplay between human and rodent vectors and the role of human behavior in the spread of plague."

This study uses the largest dataset of its kind to reconstruct the evolution of brain size in amniotes, from fish to humans. We show that reptiles have not only small brains relative to body size but also low neuronal densities, resulting in average neuron numbers over 20 times lower than those in birds and mammals of similar body size. This has important implications for studies using relative brain size as a proxy when looking for evolutionary drivers of animal cognition."

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal and transformed cells is more complex than previously appreciated. We have shown that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This study suggests that TRAP1 may be a promising target for cancer therapy. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)."

Our results thus support a mechanochemical model where a chemosensory system measures the mechanically induced conformational changes in stretched type IV pili. This finding demonstrates that type IV pili are not only used for twitching motility, but also as a sensor regulating surface-induced gene expression and pathogenicity. This mechanism may be important for the successful colonization of the human body by P. aeruginosa. Understanding how this bacterium senses its environment may lead to the development of new strategies for controlling this pathogen. (Show more)"

We have developed a method to study the folding of a large protein in high structural detail. The method is based on the observation that the folding of a protein is accompanied by a change in the rate of exchange of hydrogen atoms with deuterium. We have used this method to study the folding of the maltose binding protein. The results indicate that the folding of the protein is accompanied by the formation of a distinct intermediate that is an obligatory step in the folding process. The intermediate is composed of segments that are distant in the sequence but adjacent in the native protein. The intermediate is also composed of segments that are most protected in the early collapse of the protein into a compact state. The intermediate is the site of three destabilizing mutations that slow the folding of the protein. The results suggest that the intermediate is a common step in the folding of many proteins.

We also show that the pyrophosphohydrolase RppH, which is known to remove the cap of noncapped RNAs, is the predominant decapping enzyme in E. coli cells experiencing disulfide stress. This enzyme prefers to remove capped RNAs over their noncapped counterparts, and it does so by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to remove other 5′ termini.

The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. These findings provide insights into the BK channel’s unique properties and may help to understand the physiological roles of the BK channel.

We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition.

Here, we show that zebrafish ALK/Ltk and human ALK/Ltk are activated by zebrafish ALKALs. Zebrafish ALKALs are expressed in the neural crest and cause ectopic iridophore development. We further show that zebrafish ALKALs are required for the development of the neural crest-derived iridophores. Our results provide in vivo evidence of the involvement of ALK/Ltk family receptors in neural crest development. This is of importance for the understanding of the role of ALK/Ltk in human cancer and neuroblastoma. Furthermore, our results suggest that ALKALs are potential therapeutic targets in neuroblastoma."

The pathogen has caused devastating outbreaks throughout human history, and ancient DNA evidence has shown it afflicted human populations as far back as the Neolithic. Here, we present 17 Y. pestis genomes dating to 5,000 to 2,500 y BP from a wide geographic expanse across Eurasia. We find that the Bronze Age population carrying Y. pestis was not a distinct lineage, but rather a nonflea-adapted and potentially extinct lineage that persisted over millennia without significant parallel diversification. We also discover the presence of the flea-adapted form of Y. pestis in Bronze Age Iberia, previously only identified in in the Caucasus and the Volga regions, suggesting a much wider geographic spread of this form of Y. pestis. Together, these data reveal the dynamic nature of plague’s formative years in terms of its early evolution and ecology. (Show more)"

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, in the days (Studies 1 and 2) and months (Studies 3 through 6) following the 2016 American presidential election, women’s and men’s endorsement of HM predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. In addition, as conceptualized, HM was associated with less trust in the government (Study 3), more sexism (Study 4), more racism (Study 5), and more xenophobia (Study 6) but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors.

In the United States, the conversion of grasslands to cropland has led to massive C losses to the atmosphere. However, the efficacy of soil health management practices in annual cropping systems on Mollisols to mitigate these losses remains highly uncertain. We show that soil health management practices that incorporate legumes and manure into annual cropping systems can increase soil C storage and the use of soil C by soil microbes. These practices can therefore play a key role in climate-smart agriculture. Our results highlight the importance of integrating livestock and legumes into annual cropping systems to mitigate climate change. This approach can help to restore the ecological services of grasslands and provide a sustainable source of food and income for farmers."

One of the main rewards plants offer to pollinators is nectar. Nesocodon mauritianus (Campanulaceae) produces a blood-red nectar that has been proposed to serve as a visual attractant for pollinators. Here, we show that the nectar’s red color is derived from a previously undescribed alkaloid termed nesocodin. We identify three enzymes that are either necessary or sufficient for pigment production, including a carbonic anhydrase that increases nectar pH, an aryl-alcohol oxidase that produces a pigment precursor, and a ferritin-like catalase that protects the pigment from degradation by hydrogen peroxide. We also identify nesocodin in the red nectar of the distantly related and hummingbird-visited Jaltomata herrerae and provide molecular evidence for convergent evolution of this trait. This work cumulatively identifies a convergently evolved trait in two vertebrate-pollinated species, suggesting that the red pigment is selectively favored and that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation. This work also provides a molecular framework for understanding the evolution of this trait."

To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of two bat coronaviruses, HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. First, whereas MERS-CoV prefers human DPP4 over bat DPP4 as its receptor, HKU4 shows the opposite trend. Second, in the absence of exogenous proteases, both MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes mediate pseudovirus entry into bat cells, whereas only MERS-CoV spike, but not HKU4 spike, mediates pseudovirus entry into human cells. Thus, MERS-CoV, but not HKU4, has adapted to use human cells for cross-species transmission. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU"

Surprisingly, the results indicate that human pol δ maintains a loose association with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion.

One way to do this is to understand the role of individual components of the system. Here we show that stratospheric water vapor plays an important role in the climate system. We show that the water vapor in the stratosphere increases with the temperature of the troposphere, implying the existence of a feedback. We estimate the strength of this feedback to be +0.3 W/(m2⋅K), which would be a significant contributor to the overall climate sensitivity. This work shows that we need to understand the climate system in its entirety to understand its behavior. (Show more)"

The color of a vertebrate can be influenced by its environment, and the color change can be used for communication. In this study, we show that the color of anurans (frogs and toads) can be changed by the presence of a specific protein. This protein is present in the skin of anurans and binds biliverdin, the pigment that is responsible for the color of vertebrate blood. This is the first example of a serpin family protein that binds biliverdin in vertebrates. Our results provide evidence of the evolution of a new mechanism of color change in vertebrates. Additionally, we show that this protein has a physiological function in the color change of anurans. This study contributes to our understanding of the evolution of color in vertebrates.

We report that hypoxia induces expression of AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), an m6A demethylase, which demethylated NANOG mRNA at an m6A residue in the 3′-UTR. Increased NANOG mRNA and protein expression, and the breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) phenotype, were induced by hypoxia in an hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)- and ALKBH5-dependent manner. ALKBH5 overexpression decreased NANOG mRNA methylation, increased NANOG levels, and increased the percentage of BCSCs, phenocopying the effect of hypoxia. Thus, HIF-dependent ALKBH5 expression mediates enrichment of BCSCs in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. These findings suggest that ALKBH5 may be a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.

The source of the parchment, often called “uterine vellum,” has been a long-standing controversy in codicology. The Latin term abortivum in many sources has led some scholars to suggest that fetal calves or sheep skins were used. Others have argued that it would not be possible to sustain herds if so many pocket Bibles were made from fetal skins, arguing instead for unexpected alternatives, such as rabbit. Here, we report a simple and objective method using standard conservation treatments to identify the animal origin of parchment. The noninvasive method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals. These results suggest that ultrafine vellum does not necessarily derive from the use of abortive or newborn animals with ultrathin hides, but could equally well reflect a production"

We present a precise age model for the extinction based on U-Pb dates from five volcanic ash beds in the Meishan section, China. The extinction occurred between 251.941 ± 0.037 and 251.880 ± 0.031 Mya, an interval of 60 ± 48 ka. Onset of a major reorganization of the carbon cycle precedes the extinction and is punctuated by a sharp (3‰), short-lived negative spike in the isotopic composition of carbonate carbon. The carbon cycle volatility persists for ∼500 ka before a return to near preextinction values. The precise age model will allow a refined evaluation of the relative roles of rate-dependent processes contributing to the extinction, allowing insight into postextinction ecosystem expansion. The age model will also be critical for evaluating the plausibility of trigger and kill mechanisms. (Show more)"

Here we propose a computational model of memory in the brain that is based on the adaptive changes in excitability of neurons. This mechanism is sensitive to context and serial order and can be used to bind linguistic features over time. This model provides a neurobiological substrate for the binding of linguistic features within the brain. It also suggests a mechanism for the formation of short-term memory in the brain.

We use a high-resolution large ensemble to quantify the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the probability of occurrence of multiyear rainfall deficits in southwestern South Africa. We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% by the year 2100 under an intermediate-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5) and to 80% under a high-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5-8.5). These results highlight the strong sensitivity of the drought risk in South Africa to future anthropogenic emissions. This work is important for informing the development of drought risk management strategies. The high-resolution ensemble approach used here can be applied to other regions of the world to assess the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to drought risk. This will be critical for informing the development of drought risk management strategies.

Photosynthesis relies on these modified tetrapyrroles for the capture of solar radiation and its conversion to chemical energy. The formation of the isocyclic fifth ring, the key reaction in the biosynthesis of (bacterio)chlorophyll pigments, has remained enigmatic for more than 60 y. This reaction is catalyzed by two unrelated cyclase enzymes using different chemistries. The majority of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria use O2-sensitive [4Fe-4S] cluster proteins, whereas plants, cyanobacteria, and some phototrophic bacteria possess an O2-dependent enzyme, the major catalytic component of which is a diiron protein. Plant and cyanobacterial mutants in ycf54 display impaired function of the O2-dependent enzyme, accumulating the reaction substrate. These results indicate that Ycf54 is a cyclase subunit in oxygenic phototrophs, and that different classes of the enzyme exist based on their requirement for an additional subunit.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility in autism and suggests a potential target for the treatment of autism.

There is no specific antiviral treatment available, and the disease has a high case fatality rate. We tested the efficacy of remdesivir, a recently developed antiviral, in a nonhuman primate model of MERS-CoV infection. Remdesivir treatment initiated 24 h prior to inoculation completely prevented MERS-CoV−induced clinical disease, strongly inhibited MERS-CoV replication in respiratory tissues, and prevented the formation of lung lesions. Therapeutic remdesivir treatment initiated 12 h postinoculation also provided a clear clinical benefit, with a reduction in clinical signs, reduced virus replication in the lungs, and decreased presence and severity of lung lesions. The data presented here support testing of the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in the context of a MERS clinical trial. It may also be considered for a wider range of coronaviruses, including the currently emerging novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV. This would be of great importance, as the emergence of new coronaviruses is a major public health concern. The data presented here provide a proof of principle for the use of remdesivir in the treatment"

This study tests whether teachers can be encouraged to adopt an empathic rather than punitive mindset about discipline. In two experiments, teachers who were trained to adopt an empathic mindset about discipline reduced their use of suspension and increased students’ respect for them. In a randomized field experiment, this intervention halved suspension rates in schools where it was implemented. These findings suggest that teachers’ mindsets about discipline can be changed through scalable intervention."

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis remain unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We found that the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop). The Pro-Gate loop faces toward the minor groove of RNA:DNA hybrid and is involved in modulating the translocation of minor-groove alkylated DNA template after nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion.

To better understand how sequential proteolysis contributes to MERS-CoV infection, we introduced mutations that blocked the first cleavages of MERS-CoV S proteins. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past cell-surface proteases and into endosomes, whereas precleaved MERS viruses used endosomal fusion-activating proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry. Uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be"

The food choices of the population have a major impact on these emissions. Increasing the proportion of plant-based meals in catering outlets is a simple and effective way to reduce the environmental impact of the food system. This study shows that doubling the proportion of vegetarian meals available in a catering outlet increases the proportion of diners choosing vegetarian meals by 40%. This is equivalent to a proportional increase in vegetarian meal sales of 61%. This study also shows that the impact of increasing the proportion of vegetarian meals is concentrated among diners who are less likely to choose vegetarian meals. This suggests that increasing the proportion of vegetarian meals available in catering outlets could be a cost-effective way to increase the proportion of plant-based meals consumed by the population. This approach could be used to achieve the goals of the UK government’s 2025 target to increase the proportion of plant-based meals to 20% of all meals purchased and the 2030 target to increase the proportion of plant-based meals to 25%.

Our results provide a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general. This may have important implications for the conservation of coral reefs in a changing climate. (Show more)"

Chemotherapy is the most common treatment for breast cancer, but resistance to chemotherapy is common. In this study, we found that the expression of the type I tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor ROR1 increased in breast cancer cells following treatment with chemotherapy. We also found that ROR1 expression was associated with the expression of genes induced by the activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or B lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region 1 homolog (BMI1). Finally, we found that treatment of mice bearing breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) with the humanized anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab repressed expression of genes associated with breast cancer stemness, reduced activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or BMI1, and impaired the capacity of breast cancer PDXs to metastasize or reengraft Rag2−/−γc−/− mice. These results indicate that targeting ROR1 may improve the response to chemotherapy of patients with breast cancer. Thus, cirmtuzumab may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of breast cancer."

The eruptions led to stratospheric ozone depletion, which, in turn, caused a poleward shift of the Southern Hemisphere westerlies and a rapid advance of the Southern Ocean ice sheet. This scenario explains the onset of Southern Hemisphere deglaciation and the coincidence of the Bølling interstadial with the start of the Mount Takahe eruptions.

This DLK-independent regeneration is triggered by sensory activity and is reminiscent of a well-studied form of endogenous activity-dependent ectopic axon outgrowth in the same neuron type. These findings suggest that DLK-independent regeneration is a powerful platform for gene discovery in neuronal regeneration. Moreover, we note numerous similarities between DLK-independent regeneration and lesion conditioning, a phenomenon producing robust regeneration in the mammalian CNS.

This result is driven by two processes: (i) more diverse communities are more likely to contain species with thermal traits that enable them to maintain productivity under thermal stress, and (ii) the contribution of complementarity to the net biodiversity effect increases at high and low temperatures, indicating that species interactions play a critical role in mediating the impacts of temperature change on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

Cardiac-specific deletion of STIM1 in mice resulted in depletion of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ stores of SANCs and led to SAN dysfunction, as was evident by a reduction in heart rate, sinus arrest, and an exaggerated autonomic response to cholinergic signaling. Moreover, STIM1 influenced SAN function by regulating ionic fluxes in SANCs, including activation of a store-operated Ca2+ current, a reduction in L-type Ca2+ current, and enhancing the activities of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger.

Our results suggest that Si may promote insect resistance by priming JA-mediated defense responses. These findings provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of the beneficial effects of Si on plant resistance against insect herbivores. (Show more)"

We find that the long-time dynamics of such systems are biased toward states that exhibit a fine-tuned extremization of environmental forcing. This behavior is reminiscent of the “saddle-node” bifurcation, which is a well-known phenomenon in dynamical systems theory. We also find that the network dynamics can be accelerated by the presence of a small number of “catalyst” reactions that are able to access the rare combinations of chemical concentrations that are required to maintain the steady state. This result suggests that the presence of catalysts may be a general feature of complex systems that are exposed to rare environmental forcing."

Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results suggest that certification is not a silver bullet for tropical deforestation, but it is an important tool in the toolbox of conservation and climate mitigation efforts. We hope that our results will inform the RSPO and other certification schemes on the need for more stringent requirements to reduce deforestation and fire."

Investigation of the dynamic regulation of the evolutionarily conserved exocyst-related processes using mutants in genetically tractable organisms such as Arabidopsis thaliana is limited by the lethality or the severity of phenotypes. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 (exocyst component of 70 kDa) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking.

We sought to understand how Fe levels impact the retina, given that retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are also challenged by accumulations of vitamin A aldehyde adducts (bisretinoid lipofuscin) that photogenerate reactive oxygen species and photodecompose into damaging aldehyde- and dicarbonyl-bearing species. In albino mice with reduced intracellular Fe levels, we found that bisretinoid levels were reduced, and outer nuclear layer thickness was increased. In mice with increased intracellular Fe levels, bisretinoid levels were reduced. These findings indicate that intracellular Fe promotes bisretinoid oxidation and degradation. This interpretation was supported by experiments showing that Fe chelation decreased the oxidative/degradation of the bisretinoid A2E in the presence of light and reduced cell death in cell-based experiments. Moreover, light-independent oxidation and degradation of A2E by Fenton chemistry products were evidenced by the consumption of A2E, release of dicarbonyls, and generation of oxidized A2E species in cell-free assays.

This evolutionary history helps us understand how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs.

In particular, the use of farm machinery has led to the compaction of soil, which can have negative effects on soil ecological functioning. We show that the use of farm machinery has led to the compaction of soil to the point where it now exceeds safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. This alarming trend calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This study highlights the need for a more holistic approach to the design of farm machinery, which considers the ecological implications of the use of farm machinery in the landscape. This could lead to the development of machinery that is more sustainable and less damaging to the environment."
