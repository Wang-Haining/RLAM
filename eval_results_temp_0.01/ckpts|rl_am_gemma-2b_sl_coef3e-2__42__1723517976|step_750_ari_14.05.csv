However, the structure of hydrate formed by a gas with a small atomic radius, such as neon, has not been studied. In this work, we report the structure of neon hydrate at high pressure and temperature. The structure of neon hydrate is different from that of conventional hydrate, which is formed by a gas with a large atomic radius. The structure of neon hydrate is also different from that of ice II, which is formed by a gas with a small atomic radius. Our results provide insights into the structure of hydrate formed by a gas with a small atomic radius. They also provide a reference for the structure of ice II. (Show more)"

The evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, and a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we present a genomic and transcriptomic analysis of two myxozoans and a cnidarian parasite, and we show that the myxozoans are a sister taxon to the cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. We also show that the myxozoan genome is one of the smallest reported animal genomes and that the myxozoan body plan was reduced to a minimal set of essential genes. These results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This is an important step in understanding the evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. However, the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large herbivores in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages, and that herbivore diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This may be particularly important in light of the current global biodiversity crisis."

Our results suggest that the NWFP has not been effective in reversing the decline of older-forest–associated bird populations, and that the policy needs to be revised to ensure that older forests are conserved and developed."

We present a continuous, first-of-its-kind record of the hydroclimate of the region, which shows that the lake underwent a major shift in hydroclimate at the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT), which is also associated with the evolution of the cichlid fish species flock. The shift in hydroclimate is associated with a change in the orbital forcing of the climate system, which is consistent with the observed changes in the cichlid fish species flock. The cichlid fish species flock is a unique example of how the environment can influence the evolution of a species.

The most widely accepted estimate of the temperature of the surface of the Earth in the Archean, the earliest period of Earth’s history, is 70 ± 15 °C. This estimate is based on the isotopic composition of marine cherts, which is thought to reflect the temperature of the oceans. However, this estimate has been subject to question due to uncertainties regarding the isotopic compositions of the oceans, the possibility of isotopic resetting, and the depositional environment. We here present a method for determining the temperature of the surface of the Earth in the Archean based on the thermostability of ancestral enzymes. Our results suggest that the temperature of the surface of the Earth decreased over geological time from ∼65–80 °C in the Archean."

The two-pore-domain K+ channel, BK, is a major K+ channel in the heart and is important for cardiac excitability and contractility. The BK channel has two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. We found that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. These findings may help us understand the BK channel’s normal closing and its role in cardiac arrhythmia. (Show more)"

We show that this interaction leads to an increase in the cytoskeletal tension and a reduction in the bending modulus of the cell membrane. These changes in the membrane properties are correlated with parasite invasion efficiency. This finding suggests that the malaria parasite primes the host cell surface through its binding antigens, altering the physical properties of the target cell and thus reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion."

Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes them more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

Here, we show that the brain’s activity increases with each successive word in a sentence but decreases suddenly whenever words can be merged into a phrase. This pattern of activity is consistent with a neural implementation of a merge operation, which applies equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases. This model of language processing may be a key to understanding how the brain encodes and processes complex linguistic structures."

The stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. The human pol δ holoenzyme is known to be extremely stable, but the mechanism by which this stability is achieved is unknown. We designed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. We found that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion."

This glycan is provided to the squid only at night, when the symbiotic organ is at its most active. The glycan is catabolized by the bacteria, which in turn modulates the conditions in which they live, enhancing their ability to produce light at night. This study provides a new perspective on the regulation of symbiosis, in which the host provides a nutrient only at a specific time of day, and the host–microbe interaction is thus modulated by the timing of the provision of a single nutrient. This study also provides a potential mechanism for the regulation of the activities of epithelial-associated microbial communities in other hosts."

However, it is difficult to identify patterns in text data because of the complexity of the data and the sparsity of the patterns. We introduce a method to identify latent patterns in text data and represent documents as sequences of these patterns. We use a generative model to identify the topic that generated a sequence of words. We illustrate our method with a prominent example of underutilized text: the US National Violent Death Reporting System. Our method offers a flexible and broadly applicable approach to model patterns in text data. It can be applied to many domains and can be extended to other types of data. It can also be used to identify the gender bias of topics and to model the gendered nature of topics in text data."

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. Our study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility in autism and suggests that the forgetting process is a potential therapeutic target for autism. (Show more)"

These proteins form characteristic inclusions in the brain and spinal cord, and the presence of these inclusions is a key diagnostic feature of the disease. Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions in ALS are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. Rather, the inclusions in ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. Our results suggest that the presence of inclusions in ALS is a consequence of the disease-related loss of protein homeostasis in motor neurons. This finding may provide a rationale for the use of protein homeostasis-targeting drugs in ALS. (Show more)"

To better understand how sequential proteolysis contributes to MERS-CoV infection, we introduced mutations that blocked the first cleavages of MERS-CoV spike (S) glycoproteins. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence.

The genome of influenza A viruses is segmented into eight fragments, which offers evolutionary advantages but complicates genomic packaging. The existence of a selective packaging mechanism, in which one copy of each viral RNA is specifically packaged into each virion, is suspected, but its molecular details remain unknown. Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus. This interaction is required for optimal viral replication and favors the copackaging of the interacting viral RNA segments. Our results indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions. The lack of conservation of these interactions might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses. (Show more)"

Human-caused wildfires disproportionally occurred where fuel moisture was higher than lightning-started fires, thereby helping expand the geographic and seasonal niche of wildfire.

FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

However, the anatomical and functional organization of these cell types is not well understood. Here, we used a portable two-photon microscope to record from freely behaving mice in an open field, and we found that grid cells, which are thought to encode space in terms of a grid, are organized anatomically in a distinct layer from other cell types. These data suggest that grid cells may have a distinct functional organization from other cell types. This approach could be used to study the organization of MEC neurons in other contexts.

This effect is driven by the speed with which people respond to their partners, rather than by the speed with which they respond to others, and it is used by third-party listeners to assess the quality of the connection between two people. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"
