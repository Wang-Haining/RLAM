In this work, we report the structure of ice II hydrate, which is a new phase of water. The structure of the hydrate is determined by in situ neutron diffraction at 480 MPa and temperatures ranging from 260 to 70 K. The guest atoms are enclathrated in the water molecules to form ice II-structured hydrates. The guest atoms have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. This work provides a new route to study the structure of ice II and its hydrates, which are of great importance in understanding the properties of water under high-pressure conditions. It also provides a new route to study the structure of ice II and its hydrates, which are of great importance in understanding the properties of water under high-pressure conditions. (Show more)"

However, the evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, and the group has been considered a “living fossil.” Here, we report the results of a genomic and transcriptomic analysis of two distantly related myxozoan species and a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results show that the myxozoan body plan is the result of a dramatic reduction in gene content and that the group is a sister taxon to the cnidarians. This study provides insight into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite."

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv"

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because of the difficulty of quantifying diet composition at the species level. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species of large herbivores in semiarid African savanna. We found that the degree to which species partition food resources is dependent on the taxonomic resolution of diet analysis. At coarse trophic levels of categorization, such as “grazer” and “browser,” species were similar in diet composition, and dietary overlap was high between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. However, at finer taxonomic levels of categorization, species were dissimilar in diet composition, and dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorization may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages. Thus, the taxonomic resolution of diet analysis may be critical to understanding the role of large herbivores in biodiversity."

Our results also highlight the need for continued monitoring of bird populations and forest conditions to assess the effectiveness of the NWFP. (Read more)"

The development of new antibiotics is a major challenge for the pharmaceutical industry. In this work, we present a rational design strategy for the development of new acylide antibiotics. The strategy is based on the use of computational tools to predict the solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity of the designed compounds to the ribosome. We show that the predicted best candidate is more active than telithromycin, which is the only approved acylide antibiotic, and is more soluble and more permeable to the cell membrane. The strategy was applied to the design of a new class of acylide antibiotics, which are currently being tested in clinical trials. The results of this work are expected to contribute to the development of new antibiotics to combat antibiotic resistance. (Show more)"

Here, we introduce a network architecture that is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters, and is easier to train and apply in practice. The proposed architecture is based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters, and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data."

We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells.

At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes.

The genetic structure of the population is also influenced by the geography of the island, suggesting that the settlement happened in a nonuniform way. These results help to understand the history of Madagascar and the settlement of the Indian Ocean. They also provide a framework for the study of the human history of the region."

Here, we show that diamond can be metallized, solely under mechanical strain without phonon instability, and that its electronic bandgap can vanish. These findings offer opportunities for tailoring properties of diamond via strain engineering for electronic, photonic, and quantum applications. They also provide insights into the mechanism of metallization in other materials. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that housing mice in low humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases.

In the hypothesized RNA world, before the evolution of proteins, genetic information was stored in RNA molecules that were replicated by ribozymes. In the laboratory, RNA molecules can replicate RNA, but the process is inefficient. Here, we report the results of an effort to improve the efficiency of RNA replication by selecting variants of a ribozyme that catalyze the process more efficiently. The improved polymerase ribozyme is able to replicate RNA, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins."

This pandemic is generally understood as the consequence of a singular introduction of Yersinia pestis, after which the disease established itself in European rodents over four centuries. To locate these putative plague reservoirs, we studied the climate fluctuations that preceded regional plague epidemics, based on a dataset of 7,711 georeferenced historical plague outbreaks and 15 annually resolved tree-ring records from Europe and Asia. We provide evidence for repeated climate-driven reintroductions of the bacterium into European harbors from reservoirs in Asia, with a delay of 15 ± 1 y.

We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

Rather, they are a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. This metastable state is likely to be a consequence of the unique cellular environment of the motor neuron, and may be a common feature of other neurodegenerative diseases. This study provides a new perspective on the pathogenesis of ALS, and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies. (PsycINFO Database Record"

The band structures of the 2D photonic crystals are predicted to produce unconventional atom–light interaction behaviors, including anisotropic emission, suppressed spontaneous decay, and photon-mediated atom–atom interactions controlled by the position of the atomic array relative to the photonic crystal. The device configuration also enables application of optical tweezers for controlled placement of atoms. Devices can be fabricated reliably from a 200-nm silicon nitride device layer using a lithography-based process, producing predicted optical properties in transmission and reflection measurements. These 2D photonic crystal devices can be readily deployed to experiments for many-body physics with neutral atoms and engineering of exotic quantum matter."

These mutations compromised infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Our findings suggest that the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence."

We also show that CRF acts on the CRF receptor CRFR1 in cortical astrocytes, leading to activation of cAMP/PKA, intracellular Ca2+, and PKCε, and that this contributes to the phosphorylation and expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) to enhance water influx into astrocytes and produces an up-regulation of endothelin-1 (ET-1) expression. Finally, using CHO cells transfected with CRFR1+ and AQP4+, we show that transfected CRFR1+ contributes to edema via transfected AQP4+.

They are able to change their genome sequence, which is a major obstacle for the development of effective vaccines and drugs. One of the main reasons for this is the existence of a packaging mechanism, in which one copy of each viral RNA is specifically packaged into each virion. We identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral RNA segments of an influenza A virus. This interaction is required for optimal viral replication and is sequence specific. The lack of conservation of this interaction among influenza A viruses might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses.

Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

In this study, we show that Si pretreatment of rice plants increases resistance against the rice leaffolder, a major insect pest of rice, and that this effect is mediated by the jasmonate (JA) signaling pathway. Our results suggest that Si and JA may interact in the defense response to insect herbivores. This study provides insights into the role of Si in plant defense and may lead to the development of Si-based strategies for insect pest management. (Less)"

Here we propose a computational model of language that is based on a single mechanism: the ability to maintain information in the form of adaptive changes in neuronal excitability. This mechanism is not reliant on the maintenance of elevated firing rates, feedback, or plasticity. We show that this mechanism can support memory for information that is stored in the brain for milliseconds to seconds. We demonstrate that this mechanism is sensitive to context and serial order, which makes it suitable for temporal integration in sequence processing within the language domain. This work provides a step toward a computational neurobiology of language."

This is due to the presence of the cell wall, which is absent in mammalian cells and poses the dominant physical barrier to biomolecule delivery in plants. Herein, we report a systematic assessment of different DNA nanostructures for their ability to internalize into cells of mature plants, deliver siRNAs, and effectively silence a constitutively expressed gene in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. We show that nanostructure internalization into plant cells and corresponding gene silencing efficiency depends on the nanostructure size, shape, compactness, stiffness, and location of the siRNA attachment locus on the nanostructure. We further confirm that the internalization efficiency of DNA nanostructures correlates with their respective gene silencing efficiencies but that the endogenous gene silencing pathway depends on the siRNA attachment locus. Our work establishes the feasibility of biomolecule delivery to plants with DNA nanostructures and both details the design parameters of importance for plant cell internalization and also assesses the impact of DNA nanostructure geometry for gene silencing mechanisms. This work is expected to be of interest to the plant biology community and will help in the design of DNA nanostructures for biomolecule delivery"

In many cases, the cause of eutrophication is the discharge of nutrients from small tributaries that drain surrounding watersheds. However, decades of monitoring and regulatory efforts have focused on large water bodies, leaving small tributaries largely unaddressed. We show that the nutrient loads and concentrations delivered to the world’s fifth largest lake, Lake Michigan, by its tributaries are highly variable, with the 6 largest tributaries accounting for ∼70% of the daily nutrient loads delivered to the lake. However, small tributaries delivered loads that were high for their size and biased toward dissolved inorganic forms. Our findings suggest that small watersheds may play a greater role in driving coastal eutrophication than previously thought. Expanding nutrient management efforts to address smaller watersheds could reduce the ecological impacts of nutrient loading on valuable nearshore ecosystems. This work highlights the importance of small watersheds in driving coastal eutrophication."

We find that the long-time dynamics of such systems are biased toward states that exhibit a fine-tuned extremization of environmental forcing. This behavior is reminiscent of the “optimal fluctuation” phenomenon in physics, where the system is driven to a state that maximizes the rate of information transfer between the system and its environment. Our results suggest that the optimal fluctuation phenomenon may be a general feature of complex systems that are exposed to strong environmental forcing."

Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation.

We show that the Fe chelator deferiprone (DFP) reduces the oxidation and degradation of A2E in the presence of light, which is important for maintaining photoreceptor cell viability. This finding is important because the Fe chelator DFP is used to treat Fe deficiency in humans. Thus, the Fe chelator DFP may be useful in the treatment of retinal diseases associated with the oxidation and degradation of A2E.
