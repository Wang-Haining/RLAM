However, the structure of ice II with guest molecules is still unknown. In this work, we report the structure of ice II with neon atoms as the guest molecules. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The structure is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. The structure of ice II with guest molecules is expected to be of great importance in the field of water physics."

This resolves a question raised in reconstruction programs such as those of von Neumann, Mackey, Jauch, Piron, Abramsky, and Coecke."

To understand the extreme reduction in genome size and gene content that is characteristic of the Myxozoa, we compared the genomes of two myxozoans to the genome of a cnidarian parasite and to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian host. Our results show that the myxozoan genome is one of the smallest reported in animals, and that the myxozoan body plan is reduced to the essential elements required for survival as parasites. Our findings suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by a reduction in genome size and gene content. This reduction in genome size and gene content may have been a necessary step in the evolution of the Myxozoa."

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa in the field. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify the diet breadth, composition, and overlap of seven abundant large mammal species in semiarid African savanna. We found that the degree of species overlap in diet was correlated with the degree of species overlap in proportional grass consumption, but that the grass consumption of each species was different from that of all others. These results suggest that the degree of species overlap in diet may be a more accurate measure of competition than the degree of species overlap in proportional grass consumption. Our results also suggest that the diversity of large mammal species may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized."

This change is mediated by reduced expression of the transcription factor BCL11A. These results suggest a mechanism for chronoregulation of fetal and adult hemoglobin expression in humans.

The development of new antibiotics is a major challenge, and computational approaches are essential tools to this end. We present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. The design strategy presented here can be applied to other antibiotic classes. This work is expected to contribute to the development of new antibiotics. (Show more)"

Switching occurs near 10 pN, a force that also induces a state of the receptor−ligand complex with slower off-rate. Force greatly increases the effects of mutations in VWF, explaining pathophysiology.

They are opened and closed by their pore gates, which are composed of multiple domains. The activation gate of K+ channels is located at the intracellular end of the pore and is commonly associated with slow C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel, which is normally open and has no classic activation gate, has a slow C-type inactivation that is closed state-dependent and that its rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. We propose that the BK channel’s closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. This study provides a new perspective on the relationship between channel activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery. It also provides a possible mechanism for the BK channel’s normal closing. (Show more)"

One of the most important steps in the parasite’s life cycle is invasion of the red blood cell (RBC), where it replicates and causes disease. Here, we show that the malaria parasite binds to the surface of the RBC, and this interaction alters the biophysical properties of the cell. This change in the cell’s properties, in turn, reduces the energy barrier to invasion, allowing the parasite to overcome this barrier and invade the cell. This work provides a new perspective on the invasion process, suggesting that the malaria parasite is not simply a mechanical force, but rather a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces. This finding could lead to the development of new strategies to combat malaria. (Show more)"

We find that the spider’s web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to sense the motion of web threads, which allows the spider to remotely detect and localize the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself. The outsourcing and supersizing of auditory function in spiders provide unique features for studying extended and regenerative sensing and designing novel acoustic flow detectors for precise fluid dynamic measurement and manipulation."

The method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals, but we did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides.

Carbon cycle volatility persists for ∼500 ka before a return to near preextinction values.

Our results suggest that the transition to parasitism is a stepwise process, in which the evolutionary rate of plastid genes is relaxed in a series of rate equilibria. These equilibria are linked to the modified turnover rates of the proteins in the plastid.

The device configuration also enables application of optical tweezers for controlled placement of atoms. The device can be fabricated reliably from a 200-nm silicon nitride device layer using a lithography-based process, producing predicted optical properties in transmission and reflection measurements. These 2D photonic crystal devices can be readily deployed to experiments for many-body physics with neutral atoms and engineering of exotic quantum matter.

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis remain unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated the impact of O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (EtdT) lesions on pol II transcription. We found that pol II is stalled at the EtdT lesions, and the stalling is exacerbated by TFIIS-stimulated proofreading activity. We also found that the EtdT lesions can induce multiple transcriptional bypass routes, and the error-free route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route is observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II, which is involved in modulating the translocation of minor-groove alkylated DNA template after nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion. Taken together, this work provides important mechanistic insights into transcriptional stalling, lesion bypass, and mutagenesis of alkylated DNA lesions.

To understand the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV, we engineered viruses with mutations that blocked sequential proteolysis of the virus-surface spike (S) glycoproteins. These mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence. Our findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and may inform the development of therapeutic strategies to combat this disease."

In the United States, the economic and ecological costs of wildfire have risen substantially in recent decades. Although climate change has likely enabled a portion of the increase in wildfire activity, the direct role of people in increasing wildfire activity has been largely overlooked. We show that humans have vastly expanded the spatial and seasonal “fire niche” in the United States, accounting for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. Our results highlight the importance of human activities in increasing the fire niche and the need to reduce the risk of wildfire."

The mechanisms of ZIKV pathogenesis are not fully understood, but the virus is known to replicate within cells. Here we present a mathematical model of ZIKV dynamics in a nonhuman primate model, allowing for characterization of the growth and clearance of ZIKV within individual macaques. We find that the virus replicates rapidly and that the time to detectable virus in the blood is short. We also find that the antiviral treatment favipiravir, which blocks viral replication, can reduce the time to undetectable virus in the blood. However, the treatment is most effective when given prophylactically starting at the time of infection. The results presented here can be used to guide the design of future clinical trials.

The SAN is a highly coordinated system that is able to adjust heart rate to meet hemodynamic demand. Here, we report that stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is a key regulator of the SAN. We show that STIM1 is selectively expressed in the specialized cardiomyocytes of the SAN, and that its deletion in mice results in a reduction in the content of Ca2+ stores in these cells. This, in turn, leads to a reduction in the content of Ca2+ in the SAN, and to a reduction in heart rate. These results reveal a previously unrecognized role for STIM1 in Ca2+ stores and SAN function.

Here, we show that Si can enhance the resistance of rice to the rice leaffolder, a major insect pest, by promoting the accumulation of Si in rice leaves and by increasing the activity of the rice leaffolder-induced defense responses. These results suggest that Si may be used as a biopesticide to protect plants from insect herbivores. Our findings also suggest that Si and JA may interact to promote plant defense responses. This interaction may be important for understanding the role of Si in plant defense. (Show more)"

Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results highlight the need for certification to be tightly linked to the conservation and climate goals of the companies that purchase certified palm oil."

We sought to understand how the levels of iron, a key redox metal, impacts the retina, given that retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are also challenged by accumulations of vitamin A aldehyde adducts (bisretinoids) that photogenerate reactive oxygen species and photodecompose into damaging aldehyde- and dicarbonyl-bearing species. We found that iron levels, as reflected in transferrin receptor mRNA expression, were reduced in mice treated with the iron chelator deferiprone. In addition, iron-deficient mice exhibited reduced levels of the bisretinoid A2E, which was increased in iron-sufficient mice. These findings indicate that iron levels impact the levels of reactive oxygen species-generating products of photooxidation and the levels of bisretinoids. This interpretation was supported by experiments showing that iron-deficient mice exhibited reduced light-dependent oxidation and degradation of the bisretinoid A2E. These findings have implications for understanding the role of iron in the retina and for the development of therapeutic strategies for retinal diseases. (Read more)"

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants."
