The evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, and a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species and a less reduced cnidarian species. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insight into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1 channels, but the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These results suggest that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is largely unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa in the field. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species of large herbivores in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results also highlight the need for more comprehensive species-level identification methods to understand the role of niche partitioning in the ecology of large herbivores.

The development of new antibiotics is a major challenge, and the problem can be addressed by the rational design of new antibiotics. In this study, we present a computational approach for the design of new antibiotics. The approach is based on the prediction of the solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity of acylide antibiotics to the ribosome. The best candidate, which is synthetically more accessible, exhibits higher solubility and binding affinity to the ribosome, and is up to 56 times more active than telithromycin, is tested in vitro and in vivo. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. The approach presented here can be used to design new antibiotics for other targets and for other antibiotics. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

However, the mechanisms by which APOE isoform influences AD risk are not known. Here, we show that APOE isoform regulates the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes, which is a major process of normal synaptic turnover and turnover of senescent synapses. These studies suggest that APOE4 may be associated with defective astrocytic phagocytic capacity, which accelerates the rate of accumulation of senescent synapses and enhances synaptic vulnerability to classical-complement-cascade mediated neurodegeneration. Thus, APOE isoform may be a key factor in AD pathogenesis.

TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor.

It is a promising material for a wide range of applications, including photonics, electronics, and quantum devices. However, diamond is a brittle material, and its mechanical properties are not fully understood.

However, whether and how the brain builds such structures is largely unknown. Here, we show that the brain’s activity increases with each successive word in a sentence but suddenly increases whenever words can be merged into a phrase. Our results suggest that the brain performs a merge operation that applies equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity. More generally, our findings support the idea that the brain uses a bottom-up or left-corner parser to process the incoming language stream. They also provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists. Our results suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases. This is consistent with the idea that the brain is constantly searching for the most efficient representation of the incoming language stream. View Full-Text"

Data from monitoring records and community surveys provide evidence about how the program may affect forest outcomes. Community members perceived that the program’s monitors were new authorities with influence over forest management and that the monitors’ incentivized patrols were substitutes for traditional, unincentivized citizen patrols that suffer from free riding and inhibit timely community detection of and responses to deforestation. Should our findings be replicated elsewhere, they imply that externally facilitated community-based monitoring protocols that combine remote-sensed early deforestation alerts with training and incentives for monitors could contribute to sustainable forest management."

The spider can detect the direction and location of the source of the sound, and can even localize the sound to the level of a single thread in the web. The spider can also adjust the size of the web to the changing needs of its hearing. This study provides a unique model for studying extended and regenerative sensing and for designing novel acoustic flow detectors for precise fluid dynamic measurement and manipulation.

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, HM predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. HM was associated with less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors. The findings highlight the importance of psychological examinations of masculinity as a cultural ideology to understand how men’s and women’s endorsement of HM legitimizes patriarchal dominance and reinforces gender, race, and class-based hierarchies. They also have implications for understanding the role of masculinity in the 2020 American presidential election."

We demonstrate that monoclonal antibodies targeting IL1RAP have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. Furthermore, we show that an antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling is effective in suppressing the proliferation of primary AML cells. These results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML.

Here, we introduce a deep learning approach to improve the neutralizing activity of an antibody against SARS-CoV-2 variants. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a human antibody P36-5D2, which is effective against SARS-CoV-2 Alpha, Beta, and Gamma but not Delta. We show that our approach can identify CDR changes that can improve the antibody’s neutralizing activity against the Delta variant. Our optimized antibody can potentially be developed into antibody drug candidates for current and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

We use a high-resolution large ensemble to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the probability of occurrence of multiyear rainfall deficits in the region. We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% by the year 2100 under an intermediate-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5 [SSP2-4.5]) and to 80% under a high-emission scenario (SSP5-8.5). These results highlight the strong sensitivity of the drought risk in SSA to future anthropogenic emissions.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a framework for understanding the causal paths that lead to autism symptoms and may facilitate the development of new approaches for the treatment of autism.

We show that the provision of a single glycan, chitin, by the host to its symbiont, Vibrio fischeri, in a specific, cyclic manner, is required for the maintenance of a stable symbiosis. This glycan is consumed by the symbiont only at night, when the host organ is used for light production. The consumption of this glycan by the symbiont is also required for the periodic acidification of the host organ, which enhances the level of oxygen available to the symbionts. This study suggests that the provision of specific nutrients, whose catabolism modulates the conditions in the habitat of the symbionts, may be a general mechanism for the regulation of the activities of symbionts in animal–microbe associations.

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis remain unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We found that the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop). The Pro-Gate loop faces toward the minor groove of RNA:DNA hybrid and is involved in modulating the translocation of minor-groove alkylated DNA template after nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion. Taken together, this work provides important mechanistic insights into"

The virus infects human lung cells by binding to cell receptors and by undergoing sequential proteolysis, first to release the S glycoproteins, and second to facilitate cell membrane fusion. Here, we show that the first cleavages of the S glycoproteins are required for MERS-CoV infection of human lung cells, and that the second cleavages are required for infection of other cell types. These findings suggest that the first cleavages expand the virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence."

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive design-based analysis of the effect of universal vote-by-mail—a policy under which every voter is mailed a ballot in advance of the election—on electoral outcomes. We find that universal vote-by-mail does not appear to affect either party’s share of turnout, does not appear to increase either party’s vote share, and modestly increases overall average turnout rates. All three conclusions support the conventional wisdom of election administration experts and contradict many popular claims in the media.

We provide a global map of riverine fisheries, which reveals that the majority of catches come from regions with high levels of human population density and river discharge. We also show that freshwater fisheries provide the equivalent of all dietary animal protein for 158 million people, highlighting the critical role of rivers in providing locally sourced, low-cost protein. At the same time, our analysis reveals that fishing in regions with high biodiversity is often unsustainable, highlighting the need for improved management of inland fisheries. Our data can be used to improve the inclusion of inland fisheries in environmental planning to protect both food security and species diversity."

But how do we know when two people are connected? We asked pairs of friends and strangers to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners.

The isotopic excursions can be linked to an injection of organic matter–derived carbon over a large area and to near 20% of areal extent of seafloor anoxia. Earth system modeling indicates that widespread anoxic conditions can be linked to enhanced thermocline stratification and increased nutrient fluxes during this global warming within an icehouse. This work provides a new perspective on the history of carbon perturbation events and their potential to trigger global warming. It also highlights the potential for the release of organic matter–derived carbon to have played a role in the evolution of life on Earth."

Certification reduced deforestation by 33% from a counterfactual of 9.8 to 6.6% y−1. However, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation."

The exocyst complex is involved in the final steps of exocytosis, and its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and enhancement of vacuolar trafficking in plants. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

The first is the photochemical oxidation of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) by light, which leads to the accumulation of lipofuscin, a complex mixture of oxidized and reduced forms of vitamin A. The second form of oxidative stress is the photochemical oxidation of the photoreceptor cells, which leads to the accumulation of a complex mixture of oxidized and reduced forms of the pigment molecule, A2E. We show that the levels of iron in the retina play a role in both of these processes."

However, the evolution of predator specialization has been considered an evolutionary dead end. Here we show that the evolution of predator specialization is not only possible, but also common in nature. Our results contribute to understanding how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs. These findings contribute to our understanding of the evolution of predator specialization and its role in shaping the structure of food webs."

We have developed a small-molecule inhibitor of the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase, which converts serine to glycine and a folate-bound one-carbon unit. We show that this inhibitor is effective in cancer cells, and that the one-carbon unit donor formate is a potent rescue. We also show that the cancer cell-line screen is dominated by B-cell lines, and that one of these, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, is uniquely sensitive to inhibition of SHMT. Thus, we have identified a targetable metabolic deficiency of lymphoma. This work provides a platform for the development of a new class of cancer therapeutics. (Show more)"

The results have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. The study also highlights the need for a more holistic approach to food and nutrition security, which takes into account the role of natural landscapes such as forests in improving people’s diets. This study is also an example of how causal inference can be used to test the impact of deforestation on people’s diets."

However, the increase in capacity of farm machinery has come at a cost of increased subsoil compaction, which has been shown to have adverse effects on soil functioning and crop productivity. We show that the global distribution of subsoil compaction risk has increased over the course of modern mechanization, and that the total area of compaction risk is now larger than the area of arable land. This alarming trend calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a second paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This study highlights the need for a more holistic approach to the design of farm machinery, taking into account the intrinsic limits of the soil environment. View Full-Text"
