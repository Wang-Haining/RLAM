However, the structure of hydrate with guest molecules is still not well understood. Here, we report the structure of hydrate with neon, a noble gas, as the guest molecule. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The resolved structure where Ne dissolved in ice II is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. The density distributions indicate that the vibration of Ne atoms is mainly in planes perpendicular to D2O channels, whereas their distributions along the channels are further constrained by interactions between adjacent Ne atoms. This work provides a new insight into the structure of hydrate with guest molecules. It also provides a new route to study the structure of hydrate with guest molecules.

Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the genomes of two myxozoans and a cnidarian parasite. Our results show that myxozoans are cnidarians and are a sister taxon to the less reduced cnidarian parasite, P. hydriforme. We also show that myxozoans are among the most reduced animals in terms of genome size and gene content. Our findings suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1.

This study quantifies the magnitude of this increase and its consequences for global food security. We find that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields increases almost everywhere to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields. For the top four maize-exporting countries, which account for 87% of global maize exports, the probability that they have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. They also underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc."

However, the extent to which different herbivore species partition food resources is largely unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level differences in plant consumption. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammalian herbivore species in semiarid African savanna. We found that even closely related species differed in their plant consumption, and that species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption had the greatest dietary overlap. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages.

However, the global load of plastic on the open ocean surface was estimated to be on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This discrepancy is explained by the size distribution of the plastic debris, which points at important size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean. Copyright © 2015.

This is true for all forms of external energy supplementation, including domestication and all forms of allocare. The greatest increase in reproductive output is in species that practice allonursing.

The disease is characterized by the accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregates in affected oligodendrocytes.

It controls vascular contractility, hemostasis, and inflammation and regulates the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products between circulating blood and tissue. To control each function, the endothelium processes endlessly arriving requests from multiple sources using separate clusters of cells specialized to detect specific stimuli. A well-developed but poorly understood communication system operates between cells to integrate multiple lines of information and coordinate endothelial responses. Here, the nature of the communication network has been addressed using single-cell Ca2+ imaging across thousands of endothelial cells in intact blood vessels. Cell activities were cross-correlated and compared to a stochastic model to determine network connections. Highly correlated Ca2+ activities occurred in scattered cell clusters, and network communication links between them exhibited unexpectedly short path lengths. The number of connections between cells (degree distribution) followed a power-law relationship revealing a scale-free network topology. The path length and degree distribution revealed an endothelial network with a “small-world” configuration.

Despite recent advances in cancer treatment, the majority of patients do not respond to therapy and succumb to the disease. Cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and the development of resistance to therapy is a major obstacle to successful treatment. In this study, we found that the activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis confers cancer cells resistance to ferroptosis, a form of regulated necrosis driven by iron-dependent peroxidation of phospholipids. This resistance is mediated by the induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1/stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1-dependent lipogenesis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction is effective in preclinical models of cancer. These findings suggest that ferroptosis may be a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer patients with PI3K-mutated or PTEN-defective tumors. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc."

Specifically, marijuana abusers had reduced decreases in striatal dopamine D2 receptor availability (reflecting DA increases) when challenged with MP. In ventral striatum (key brain reward region), MP-induced reductions in DVs and BPND (reflecting DA increases) were inversely correlated with scores of negative emotionality, which were significantly higher for marijuana abusers than controls. In marijuana abusers, DA responses in ventral striatum were also inversely correlated with addiction severity and craving. The attenuated responses to MP, including reduced decreases in striatal DVs, are consistent with decreased brain reactivity to the DA stimulation in marijuana abusers that might contribute to their negative emotionality and addictive behaviors.

Using Bayesian inference, we found that this model fits mortality curves from nine outbreaks in Europe better than models for rodent or pneumonic transmission. Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346–1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats.

However, current inhibitors cannot distinguish between TRAP1 and HSP90, making their utility as probes of TRAP1-specific function questionable. We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of TRAP1 function in cancer and suggests that TRAP1 may be a promising target for cancer therapy. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc."

This study shows that the evolution of an aquatic lifestyle is driving three of the four extant aquatic mammal clades toward a size attractor at ∼500 kg. The existence of this body size attractor and the relatively rapid selection toward, and limited deviation from, this attractor rule out most hypothesized drivers of size increase. These three independent body size increases and a shared aquatic optimum size are consistent with control by differences in the scaling of energetic intake and cost functions with body size between the terrestrial and aquatic realms. Under this energetic model, thermoregulatory costs constrain minimum size, whereas limitations on feeding efficiency constrain maximum size. Rather than being released from size pressures, water-dwelling mammals are driven and confined to larger body sizes by the strict energetic demands of the aquatic medium. Copyright © 2015.

SOC systems are ubiquitous in nature and are of great interest to scientists. In this paper, we report on our discovery of a tropical model with SOC behavior. Our model is continuous, in contrast to all known models of SOC, and is a certain scaling limit of the sandpile model, the first and archetypical model of SOC. We describe how our model is related to pattern formation and proportional growth phenomena and discuss the dichotomy between continuous and discrete models in several contexts. Our aim in this context is to present an idealized tropical toy model, requiring further investigation."

We show that the sperm proteome undergoes substantial compositional changes after being transferred to the female reproductive tract. Multiple seminal fluid proteins initially associate with sperm, but most become undetectable after sperm are stored. Female-derived proteins also begin to associate with sperm immediately after mating, and they comprise nearly 20% of the postmating sperm proteome following 4 d of storage in the female reproductive tract.

Ion channels are activated by changes in their membrane potential and then inactivated by changes in the concentration of intracellular calcium. The K+ channel BK lacks an intracellular activation gate and normally shows no C-type inactivation. We found that BK channels’ C-type inactivation is state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation.

We present 17 ancient Yersinia pestis genomes from Eurasia dating to the Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age (LNBA) period, which spans 5,000 to 2,500 y BP. Our results reveal a nonflea-adapted and potentially extinct single lineage that persisted over millennia without significant parallel diversification, accompanied by rapid dispersal across continents. We also discover the presence of the flea-adapted form of plague in Bronze Age Iberia, previously only identified in the Caucasus and the Volga regions, suggesting a much wider geographic spread of this form of plague. Together, these data reveal the dynamic nature of plague’s formative years in terms of its early evolution and ecology. This information is critical for understanding the origins of plague and its impact on human history. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc."

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, in the days (Studies 1 and 2) and months (Studies 3 through 6) following the 2016 American presidential election, women’s and men’s endorsement of hegemonic masculinity predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. In addition, as conceptualized, hegemonic masculinity predicted less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors. The findings highlight the importance of psychological examinations of masculinity as a cultural ideology to understand how men’s and women’s endorsement of hegemonic masculinity legitimizes patriarchal dominance and reinforces gender, race, and class-based hierarchies via candidate support.

These results highlight the potential of well-managed grasslands to sequester SOC on North American agricultural soils.

The analysis of the collective genetic ancestry of these individuals indicates that women had a very high genetic heterogeneity, including signals of ancestry from western Europe to East Asia. In addition, we found that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago. This example of female-biased migration indicates that complex demographic processes during the Early Medieval period may have contributed in an unexpected way to shape the modern European genetic landscape. Examination of the panel of functional loci also revealed that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago.

To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of two bat coronaviruses, HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. First, whereas MERS-CoV prefers human DPP4 over bat DPP4 as its receptor, HKU4 shows the opposite trend. Second, in the absence of exogenous proteases, both MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes mediate pseudovirus entry into bat cells, whereas only MERS-CoV spike, but not HKU4 spike, mediates pseudovirus entry into human cells. Thus, MERS-CoV, but not HKU4, has adapted to use human cells for cross-species transmission. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and"

The polymerase responsible for this process is pol δ. The stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. We designed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. We found that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This work provides a unique perspective on the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme and its implications for lagging strand synthesis. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In the hypothesized RNA world, before the evolution of proteins, genetic information was stored in RNA molecules that were replicated by RNA enzymes. In the laboratory, RNA polymerase ribozymes have been used to synthesize RNA molecules, but their activity has been limited to short, simple structures. Here, we report the results of an in vitro evolution experiment that improved the activity of an RNA polymerase ribozyme. The improved polymerase can synthesize a variety of complex RNA molecules, including aptamers, ribozymes, and tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of PCR.

We connect changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods with economic and demographic data and find that three factors predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

However, the mechanisms by which hypoxia promotes cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype and properties are not well understood. We report that hypoxia induces expression of AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), which demethylates m6A modifications on NANOG mRNA. ALKBH5 expression is induced by hypoxia via the hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1α and HIF-2α. NANOG mRNA demethylation and NANOG protein expression are increased by hypoxia in an HIF- and ALKBH5-dependent manner. NANOG overexpression increases the percentage of breast cancer cells that are cancer stem cell-like. Thus, hypoxia induces ALKBH5 expression, which promotes the CSC phenotype. This study provides insight into the mechanisms by which hypoxia promotes CSC properties. These findings may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for breast cancer. Copyright © 2015.

These results suggest that ultrafine vellum does not necessarily derive from the use of abortive or newborn animals with ultrathin hides, but could equally well reflect a production process that allowed the skins of maturing animals of several species to be rendered into vellum of equal quality and fineness.

The age model for this event is critical for understanding its cause and the controls on extinction/recovery dynamics. We present a precise age model for the extinction based on U-Pb dating of volcanic ash beds. The age of the extinction is 251.941 ± 0.037 and 251.880 ± 0.031 Mya, an interval of 60 ± 48 ka. The carbon cycle reorganization that occurred immediately before the extinction is punctuated by a sharp (3‰), short-lived negative spike in the isotopic composition of carbonate carbon. The carbon cycle volatility persists for ∼500 ka before a return to near preextinction values. The precise age model will permit a refined evaluation of the relative roles of rate-dependent processes contributing to the extinction. This will allow insight into postextinction ecosystem expansion and establish an accurate time point for evaluating the plausibility of trigger and kill mechanisms. Copyright © 2015.

RORα deletion leads to excessive NF-κB signaling in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), which in turn promotes the development of IBD. Our findings provide a potential therapeutic target for IBD.

We use cryo-electron microscopy to compare the structure of the D614 and G614 spike proteins and show that the G614 mutant spike adopts a range of more open conformations that may facilitate binding to the ACE2 receptor and the subsequent structural rearrangements required for viral membrane fusion. This may explain the increased infectivity of G614 mutants. Our data provide a structural basis for the increased infectivity of G614 mutants.

This glycan is released by hemocytes into the symbiotic crypts just before dusk, when the squid is most likely to be foraging. We show that the glycan is catabolized by the symbionts, whose activity is maintained at a constant level by the cyclic delivery of the glycan.

We use a high-resolution large ensemble to quantify the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the probability of occurrence of multiyear rainfall deficits in southwestern South Africa. We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% by the year 2100 under an intermediate-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5) and to 80% under a high-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5-8.5). These results highlight the strong sensitivity of the drought risk in SSA to future anthropogenic emissions. This work provides a quantitative assessment of the role of anthropogenic climate change in the recent drought and its future intensification. It also provides a tool for assessing the risk of future droughts in SSA. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The first test explosion of a nuclear bomb, the Trinity test of 16 July 1945, resulted in the fusion of surrounding sand, the test tower, and copper transmission lines into a glassy material known as “trinitite.” Here, we report the discovery, in a sample of red trinitite, of a hitherto unknown composition of icosahedral quasicrystal, Si61Cu30Ca7Fe2. It represents the oldest extant anthropogenic quasicrystal currently known, with the distinctive property that its precise time of creation is indelibly etched in history. Like the naturally formed quasicrystals found in the Khatyrka meteorite and experimental shock syntheses of quasicrystals, the anthropogenic quasicrystals in red trinitite demonstrate that transient extreme pressure–temperature conditions are suitable for the synthesis of quasicrystals and for the discovery of new quasicrystal-forming systems. The discovery of this material provides a unique window into the history of the nuclear age. The material is available for scientific study and may be displayed to the public. It is"

Photosynthesis relies on these modified tetrapyrroles for the capture of solar radiation and its conversion to chemical energy. The formation of the isocyclic fifth ring, the cyclase reaction, has remained enigmatic for more than 60 y. This reaction is catalyzed by two unrelated cyclase enzymes using different chemistries. The majority of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria use BchE, an O2-sensitive [4Fe-4S] cluster protein, whereas plants, cyanobacteria, and some phototrophic bacteria possess an O2-dependent enzyme, the major catalytic component of which is a diiron protein, AcsF. Plant and cyanobacterial mutants in ycf54 display impaired function of the O2-dependent enzyme, accumulating the reaction substrate. Swapping cyclases between cyanobacteria and purple phototrophic bacteria reveals three classes of the O2-dependent enzyme. These data delineate three classes of O2-dependent cyclase in chlorophototrophic organisms from higher plants to bacteria, and their evolution is discussed herein. Copyright © 2015.

Neuroactive protein kinase ASK1 is involved in neuroinflammation, but its precise cellular and molecular mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we generated conditional knockout (CKO) mice that lack ASK1 in T cells, dendritic cells, microglia/macrophages, microglia, or astrocytes. We found that ASK1 deficiency in microglia/macrophages and astrocytes ameliorated the disease severity in EAE. ASK1 signaling in microglia/macrophages played a major role in generating and maintaining disease. Activated astrocytes produce key inflammatory mediators, including CCL2, that further activated and recruited microglia/macrophages. Astrocyte-specific analysis revealed CCL2 expression was higher in the later stage compared with the early stage, suggesting a greater proinflammatory role of astrocytes in the later stage.

We find that the probability of drought has increased in the past two decades because of the combined effects of anthropogenic warming and natural climate variability. The probability that precipitation deficits are also warm has increased, and the probability that precipitation deficits produce drought has increased. These changes are likely due to anthropogenic warming. The probability that dry precipitation years are also warm is very high in climate model simulations of a warming world. Thus, anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability that dry precipitation years are also warm. This increase in probability is likely to have contributed to the exceptional drought in California.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. We used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility in autism and suggests a potential therapeutic target.

We demonstrate that the release of aggregates requires N-ethylmalemide–sensitive fusion protein 1, indicating that active release and uptake of aggregates are important elements of spreading and disease progression.

One such adaptation is the conversion of serine to glycine, which is then imported into the cell and used to synthesize DNA. This metabolic adaptation is targeted by the small molecule inhibitor pyrazolopyran, which is a dual inhibitor of serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 and 2. We show that dual inhibition of serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 and 2 is effective in blocking tumor growth in a colon cancer xenograft model. We also show that the cancer cell-line screen reveals that B-cell lines are particularly sensitive to serine hydroxymethyltransferase inhibition. Finally, we show that the cancer cell-line screen reveals that DLBCL is uniquely dependent upon serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1/2 for glycine import. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

The disease is associated with the formation of intracellular inclusion bodies that contain a variety of proteins that do not share obvious characteristics other than coaggregation. Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions in ALS are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. To explain the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in the brain and spinal cord, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

However, the mechanisms by which this is achieved are poorly understood. Here, we show that the squid Euprymna scolopes regulates the activities of its luminescent symbiont Vibrio fischeri through the strategic provision of a single glycan. This glycan is synthesized by the host and delivered to the symbiotic crypts only at dusk. The catabolism of this glycan by the symbionts is required for their survival and for the acidification of the crypts, which enhances their capacity to produce bioluminescence at night. This glycan may be a general nutrient used by other animal hosts to regulate the activities of their symbionts. Understanding the mechanisms by which animals control their symbionts may provide insights into the evolution of the mutualism and the health of the host. Copyright © 2015.

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis remain unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We found that pol II stalling at O2-EtdT and N3-EtdT sites is exacerbated by TFIIS-stimulated proofreading activity. We also identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop). The Pro-Gate loop faces toward the minor groove of RNA:DNA hybrid and is involved in modulating the translocation of minor-groove alkylated DNA template after nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion. This work provides important mechanistic insights into transcriptional stalling, lesion bypass, and mutagenesis of alkylated DNA lesions. These findings will be useful for understanding the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced mutagenesis and developing novel strategies for DNA repair and cancer therapy. Copyright © 202"

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into endosomes. Uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases.

The development of breast cancer is associated with the activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or BMI1, which are important in the regulation of stemness. The type I tyrosine kinaselike orphan receptor ROR1 is expressed in breast cancer cells and may be important in the regulation of stemness. Here we show that treatment of breast cancer cells with chemotherapy enhances the expression of ROR1, which in turn enhances the expression of genes induced by the activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or BMI1. Furthermore, we show that the humanized anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab can repress the expression of genes associated with stemness and reduce the capacity of breast cancer cells to metastasize or reengraft mice. These results suggest that targeting ROR1 may improve the response to chemotherapy of patients with breast cancer. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc."

We found that the dominant RSN was topographically similar to the default mode network. In contrast, in Parkinson’s disease, this RSN was subordinated to an independent disease-related pattern. Network functionality was assessed by quantifying metabolic RSN expression in cerebral blood flow PET scans acquired at rest and during task performance.

Fibrous sheath interacting protein 1 (FSIP1) is a cancer antigen expressed in the majority of TNBCs. However, the role of FSIP1 in TNBC progression and drug sensitivity has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. This article is protected by copyright.

This work provides a major step forward in understanding the biosynthesis of tomato flavor. It also provides a model for understanding the biosynthesis of other nitrogenous volatiles in other species. This information will be useful for improving the flavor of tomato and other fruit.

However, these factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function.

Thus, they rely on the delivery of biomolecules to the cell for survival. The delivery of biomolecules to plants is challenging because of the cell wall, which is absent in mammalian cells. Here, we demonstrate that DNA nanostructures can be used to deliver biomolecules across the cell wall. We show that the size, shape, compactness, stiffness, and attachment location of the DNA nanostructures are important design parameters for successful delivery of biomolecules to plants. We also show that the endogenous gene silencing pathway depends on the attachment location of the siRNA. Our work establishes the feasibility of DNA nanostructures for biomolecule delivery to plants and also details the design parameters for successful delivery. This work will be useful for the plant biotechnology community. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc."

In the United States, the majority of nutrient pollution comes from small, nonpoint sources that drain surrounding watersheds. However, decades of monitoring and regulatory efforts have focused on large watersheds, leaving small tributaries largely unaddressed. We show that nutrient loads, concentrations, and bioavailability vary widely among small tributaries of large lakes. The 6 largest tributaries of Lake Michigan accounted for ∼70% of the daily nutrient loads delivered to the lake. However, small tributaries exhibited nutrient loads that were high for their size and biased toward dissolved inorganic forms. Our findings reveal an underappreciated role that small streams may play in driving coastal eutrophication in large water bodies. Expanding nutrient management efforts to address smaller watersheds could reduce the ecological impacts of nutrient loading on valuable nearshore ecosystems. Copyright © 2015.

We find that the long-time dynamics of such systems are biased toward states that exhibit a fine-tuned extremization of environmental forcing. This behavior is reminiscent of the “saddle-node” bifurcation, which is a well-known phenomenon in dynamical systems. We show that the saddle-node bifurcation is a generic feature of the dynamics of a network exposed to a strong thermodynamic forcing. We also show that the saddle-node bifurcation is a necessary condition for the emergence of a stable steady state."

Here we show that NMDAR-Ab encephalitis can cause changes in cortical microcircuitry that alter the spectral composition of spontaneous EEG activity. We use a dynamic causal model to identify the key synaptic parameters that best explain EEG paroxysms in pediatric patients with NMDAR-Ab encephalitis. Finally, we show that these changes render microcircuitry critically susceptible to overt EEG paroxysms when these key parameters are changed, even though the same parameter fluctuations are tolerated in the in silico model of the control condition. These findings offer mechanistic insights into circuit-level dysfunction induced by NMDAR-Ab. They also provide a framework for understanding the effects of other types of synaptic dysfunction on EEG. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

However, the history of abrupt climate change is poorly understood because of the lack of high-resolution, multiproxy records. Here, we present a high-resolution, multiproxy record of a global warming event that occurred during a glacial period. We show that the event was associated with a doubling of atmospheric CO2 and a biodiversity nadir. The event was linked to an injection of organic matter–derived carbon and to an increase in nutrient fluxes. These results are consistent with a model prediction that global warming can be linked to an increase in nutrient fluxes. This work provides a new perspective on the history of abrupt climate change. It also provides a model-constrained understanding of the Earth system response to global warming. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

We show that RSPO certification reduced deforestation in Indonesia by 33%. However, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results suggest that certification is not a silver bullet for tropical deforestation. Rather, it is a tool that can be used to achieve conservation and climate goals. However, to be effective, certification must be used in conjunction with other policies. Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Inc."

We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease.

In vertebrates, sex is determined by a single locus, which can be male- or female-determining. In contrast, in many fish, birds, and insects, sex is determined by multiple interacting alleles, which can result in more than two genotypic sexes. Here we investigate the effects of multiple interacting alleles on secondary sexual characteristics in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii. We find that multiple alleles can produce modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics, including genital morphology, craniofacial morphology, gastrointestinal morphology, and home tank behaviors. These results provide context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations. Understanding the evolutionary history of sex determination is important for understanding the evolution of sexual dimorphism and sexual conflict. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc."

We studied the evolution of siphonophore tentacles, and found that they have strong evolutionary associations with prey type. Siphonophore specialization can evolve from one prey type to another, and the evolution of siphonophore tentacles is linked to the evolution of prey type.

One such metabolic adaptation is the conversion of serine to glycine by the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). SHMT is up-regulated in cancer, and the mitochondrial isozyme is particularly important. Here we show that dual SHMT1/2 knockout blocks colon cancer tumor xenograft formation. We also identify small-molecule dual inhibitors of SHMT1/2, and show that they are effective in cellular models.

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants.
