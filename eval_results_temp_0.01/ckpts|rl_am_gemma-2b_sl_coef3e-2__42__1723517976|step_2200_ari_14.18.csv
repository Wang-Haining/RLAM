The hydrate formation is of great importance in the petroleum industry, as it is the main form of gas storage in the deep ocean and the continental margin. However, the structure of the hydrate is still a mystery, and the presence of guest molecules in the hydrate is a long-standing debate. In this work, we report the structure of a hydrate with guest molecules, which is a milestone in the study of hydrates."

However, the evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, and the molecular basis for the transition from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic myxozoan is unknown. Here, we present the first comparative genomic analysis of two distantly related myxozoans and a cnidarian parasite, and we show that myxozoans are a sister group to the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results provide insights into the molecular basis of the extreme reduction in genome size and gene content that characterizes the Myxozoa. These results have implications for understanding the evolution of parasitism and the origin of multicellularity."

Our results unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the host innate immune response and could lead to the development of new antiviral strategies. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of proton channels, but the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels."

This distribution is mostly due to the size distribution of the debris, which is dominated by small particles. We suggest that the fate of the missing plastic debris is to be found in the ocean interior, where it may be responsible for a number of processes that are still to be discovered."

We present a continuous, first-of-its-kind 1.3-My record of continental hydroclimate and lake-level variability derived from drill core data from Lake Malawi, East Africa. We observe dramatic shifts in effective moisture, resulting in large-scale changes in one of the world’s largest lakes and most diverse freshwater ecosystems. The results show evidence for 24 lake level drops of more than 200 m during the Late Quaternary, including 15 lowstands when water levels were more than 400 m lower than modern. A dramatic shift is observed at the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT), consistent with far-field climate forcing, which separates vastly different hydroclimate regimes before and after 800,000 years ago. Before 800 ka, lake levels were lower, indicating a climate drier than today, and water levels changed frequently. Following the MPT high-amplitude lake level variations dominate the record.

We show that the magnetic grains and microspherules are not of extraterrestrial origin, but are derived from the crust. Furthermore, the rare earth element and Sr and Nd isotope compositions of the magnetic grains and microspherules indicate that they are derived from a source in the Grenville Province of northeastern North America, suggesting that the magnetic grains and microspherules are of terrestrial origin and are a key to understanding the Younger Dryas cooling."

The strongest genetic risk factor influencing susceptibility to AD is apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. APOE has three common isoforms in humans, E2, E3, and E4. APOE E4 allele increases risk by ∼12-fold whereas APOE E2 allele is associated with an ∼twofold decreased risk for AD. These data put APOE central to AD pathophysiology, but it is not yet clear how APOE alleles modify AD risk. Here, we report a novel role for APOE in controlling the phagocytic capacity of astrocytes that is highly dependent on APOE isoform. We also found that the presence of APOE4 allele increases the accumulation of a complement component in the brain, suggesting that defective phagocytic capacity of astrocytes may contribute to the increased vulnerability of APOE4 to AD. These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes. They also suggest the hypothesis that AD susceptibility of APOE4 may originate in part from defective phagocytic capacity of astrocytes"

Unexpectedly, RppH prefers to recognize capped 5′ ends by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5′ termini, resulting in a one-nucleotide shift in substrate specificity. This shift in substrate specificity, coupled with the unconventional manner in which capped substrates bind to the active site of RppH, could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress. Understanding the mechanisms by which these enzymes function could lead to the development of new strategies for controlling gene expression. (Show more)"

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how HKU4 and HKU5 transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmission. Our findings provide insights into the evolution of MERS-CoV and HKU4 and may help in the development of strategies to prevent and control future bat coronavirus cross-species transmissions.

The stability of this complex is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. We designed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. The results indicate that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion.

Here, we report the results of an in vitro evolution experiment that led to the improvement of the activity and generality of an RNA polymerase ribozyme. The improved polymerase ribozyme can synthesize a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and, in low yield, even tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR.

Moreover, Th17 cells can provide “help” for the development of classic Th1 cells.

This mechanism is sensitive to context and serial order, and it can be used to bind information over time. This is a new approach to memory that does not rely on persistent activity, excitatory feedback, or synaptic plasticity. It is also sensitive to the context in which information is stored, which makes it suitable for temporal integration in sequence processing within the language domain. This work provides a step toward a computational neurobiology of language."

In this study, we present the largest global dataset to date of soil respiration measurements, and we use this dataset to investigate the temperature response of soil respiration. Our analysis reveals that the temperature response of soil respiration is highly variable across biomes, and that the response is not consistent across all biomes, as has been suggested by some single-site studies. Our results suggest that the response of soil respiration to climate change may be regionally variable, with colder regions being more responsive to warming than warmer regions. This study provides a unique cross-biome perspective on the temperature response of soil respiration, information critical to improving our mechanistic understanding of how soil carbon dynamics change with climatic warming."

The results also show that the drought risk in SSA will increase substantially under high-emission scenarios. This study provides a valuable contribution to the scientific community and to the public debate on the causes of the drought and its implications for the future. It also provides a useful example of how climate models can be used to quantify the impact of anthropogenic climate change on extreme events. This approach can be applied to other regions and events.

We find that precipitation deficits that occurred when conditions were warm were more than twice as likely to yield drought years. We also find that although there has not been a substantial change in the probability of either negative or moderately negative precipitation anomalies in recent decades, the probability of drought has increased. In addition, the probability that precipitation deficits co-occur with warm conditions and the probability that precipitation deficits produce drought have both increased.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the converging functions of autism-risk genes and may facilitate the identification of the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms. It also provides a model system for the study of the underlying mechanisms of behavioral flexibility. This study may also have implications for the development of behavioral therapies for autism."

However, the mechanisms of virus spillover from bats are not well understood. Here, we identified a protein, MTX, that is highly concentrated in the submandibular salivary gland of the bat, Myotis pilosus, and demonstrated that MTX has the potential to facilitate viral infection. MTX is a potent inhibitor of leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (LTA4H), which is responsible for the conversion of leukotriene A4 to leukotriene B4, a potent lipid chemoattractant for host defense against infection. MTX potently inhibits LTA4H and therefore maintains high stability and induces immune tolerance. This study provides deeper insight into immunologically privileged sites for microbial community residence in bats and supports the therapeutic potential of targeting MTX-LTA4H. It also provides a better understanding of the mechanisms of virus spillover from bats and may help to prevent the emergence of future zoonotic diseases. (Show more)"

To better understand the mechanisms of MERS-CoV infection, we introduced mutations that blocked sequential proteolysis of the virus spike (S) glycoproteins. These mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence."

The dodder plant does not synthesize its own food, but instead depends on the host plant for its nutrition. Dodder is able to synchronize its flowering with that of its host, which is likely an adaptation to optimize parasite fitness. We show that the flowering of the host is required for the flowering of the dodder, and that this is mediated by the movement of FT proteins from the host to the dodder. This study illustrates how regressive evolution, commonly found in parasites, may facilitate the physiological synchronization of parasite and host, here allowing the dodder plant to time reproduction exactly with that of their hosts. This may be an important mechanism for the success of dodder as a root parasite."

In this study, we show that the evolution of the feeding strategy of a group of predators, siphonophores, is linked to the evolution of their feeding structures. Our results provide a broader perspective on the evolution of predatory specialization, and help understand how morphological innovation and evolution have shaped present-day food webs."

This study provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key derived feature of the human hand, the third metacarpal styloid process, and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo. This study also provides a new perspective on the evolution of the human hand and the origins of modern human-like hand function. Together, these results provide insight into the evolution of the human hand and the origins of modern human-like hand function. They also highlight the importance of the study of early hominins in understanding the evolution of the human hand."

Here we report the discovery of a series of small-molecule inhibitors of SHMT, and show that they are effective in blocking the growth of colon cancer xenografts. We also show that the one-carbon donor, formate, is a potent rescue of SHMT inhibition, but paradoxically increases the cytotoxicity of SHMT inhibitors in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. These findings provide a foundation for the development of SHMT inhibitors as a new class of cancer therapeutics. They also highlight the importance of understanding the metabolic requirements of cancer cells, and the potential for metabolic targeting to be a new therapeutic strategy for cancer."

The results have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. The study also highlights the need to consider the role of natural landscapes in meeting nutrition goals, and to consider the impact of deforestation on people’s diets."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We hypothesize that the roaming of sauropods, the largest terrestrial animals that walked Earth, would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis calls for a reexamination of the ecological history of sauropods and the development of a new paradigm for the evolution of large-scale terrestrial locomotion. It also suggests that the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth."
