In this work, we report the synthesis and structure of neon hydrate, which is the first example of a hydrate with ice II structure. The guest atoms are enclathrated in the ice II channels, and the guest–host interactions are weak. The structure of neon hydrate is stable at 480 MPa and 260 K, which is the highest pressure and lowest temperature at which a hydrate has been studied. The results provide insights into the structure of ice II and the mechanism of enclathration. They also provide a new route to study the structure of ice II and the mechanism of enclathration."

Although the evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we present the first comparative analysis of the genomes and transcriptomes of two distantly related species of myxozoans and a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results show that the myxozoan genome is one of the smallest reported in animals, and that the transition from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic myxozoan was accompanied by extreme reduction in gene content. These results provide insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that the SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein Orf6 is able to block nuclear import of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) proteins, impairing the induction of antiviral genes. We found that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and interacts with Nup98-Rae1, a protein complex involved in the nuclear import of ISGs. We show that the interaction with Nup98-Rae1 is required for the antiviral activity of Orf6. Our data unveil a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the antiviral response of the host and may help to design new antiviral strategies. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

This increase will be particularly challenging in the tropics, where the optimum growing temperature is exceeded in many places. We show that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields will increase to values much larger than present-day values as the global mean temperature increases. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and to a decrease in mean yields. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the 800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. They also underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance."

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because species-level identification of plant material is prohibitively time-consuming. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species of large herbivores in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between species, even when species were matched in body size and digestive physiology. Moreover, diet composition differed between grazing and browsing guilds, and between grazers and browsers. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages. Our results also highlight the importance of plant diversity in grasslands, which is often overlooked in studies of large herbivore ecology. Collectively, these findings suggest that the role of large herbivores in grasslands may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This may have important implications for the conservation of grasslands worldwide."

The greatest increase in reproductive output is in species that practice allonursing.

High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low-anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as decreased ATP and increased ROS production in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious individuals. We conclude that mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens is crucial for social hierarchy establishment and is critically involved in the low social competitiveness associated with high anxiety.

In this study, we found that the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis protects cancer cells from ferroptosis through the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and its transcriptional target stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1). This resistance to ferroptosis is mediated by sustained activation of mTORC1 and the induction of SREBP1. In contrast, mTORC1 inhibition sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis, and this sensitivity is lost when SREBP1 is ablated. These findings suggest that mTORC1 inhibition is a promising strategy for cancer therapy in the presence of PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway mutation. The combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction may be a promising strategy for cancer therapy in the presence of PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway mutation.

We show that LCCBs activate the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stromal-interacting molecule (STIM) Ca2+ sensor proteins and the plasma membrane ORAI Ca2+ channels, which drive vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) remodeling. Our data indicate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. Our findings have implications for the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated."

The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. The predicted best candidate is synthetically more accessible, exhibits higher solubility and binding affinity to the ribosome, and is up to 56 times more active against resistant pathogens than telithromycin.

At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness.

ADF/cofilin is a key regulator of cell motility and cytokinesis, and it is also involved in the formation of stress fibers and lamellipodia. However, the mechanism by which ADF/cofilin disassembles actin filaments is still unclear. Here, we show that ADF/cofilin can sever actin filaments, and we demonstrate that this process is enhanced by a mechanical torque. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of ADF/cofilin in the formation of lamellipodia and stress fibers, and they also suggest that this mechanochemical mechanism is critical to the disassembly of filament networks in cells."

This enzyme is the predominant decapping enzyme in Escherichia coli cells experiencing disulfide stress, and it preferentially removes Np4-capped transcripts over their triphosphorylated and diphosphorylated counterparts. The unique manner in which capped substrates of this kind bind to the active site of RppH positions the δ-phosphate, rather than the β-phosphate, for hydrolytic attack, generating triphosphorylated RNA as the primary product of decapping.

We show that force application switches VWF to a second state with faster on-rate, providing a mechanism for activating VWF binding to platelets. Switching occurs near 10 pN, a force that also induces a state of the receptor−ligand complex with slower off-rate. Force greatly increases the effects of VWF mutations, explaining pathophysiology. Conversion of single molecule kon (s−1) to bulk phase kon (s−1M−1) and the kon and koff values extrapolated to zero force for the low-force pathways show remarkably good agreement with bulk-phase measurements.

However, it is difficult to be well represented in current climate models due to the complexity of this process. Observations of ACI are challenging because of the lack of high-resolution and simultaneous observations of aerosols and clouds. Here, we introduce a new technique, the dual-field-of-view high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL), to overcome this conundrum. This instrument can simultaneously measure aerosols and clouds, especially water cloud microphysical properties. We demonstrate the scientific potential of this instrument by conducting observations over Beijing, China. The observations show that the increased aerosol loading led to increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius, consistent with expectations. This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations obtained from the dual-FOV HSRL constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI process. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI."

The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. These findings provide insights into the mechanism of K+ channel regulation. (Show more)"

This is the first demonstration that the parasite alters the biophysical properties of the host cell, which, in turn, may alter the physical forces acting on the parasite and thus facilitate invasion. This work provides a major change in our understanding of the invasion process, suggesting that the malaria parasite is not simply a mechanical force, but rather a complex system of physical forces that must be overcome to successfully invade the host cell.

The seasonal outbreaks of influenza virus correlate closely with decreases in ambient humidity.

Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how HKU4 and HKU5 transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results suggest that MERS-CoV, but not HKU4, has adapted to use human cells for cross-species transmission. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmission. Our findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and the evolution of bat coronaviruses. They also provide a rationale for the development"

In the laboratory, RNA molecules can be evolved to have catalytic activity, and in vitro evolution has been used to improve the activity of RNA molecules. Here, we report the results of in vitro evolution of a ribozyme that can synthesize RNA molecules from an RNA template. The evolved ribozyme is able to synthesize a variety of RNA molecules, including aptamers, ribozymes, and tRNA. Furthermore, the evolved ribozyme can replicate RNA molecules, amplify RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold, and synthesize functional proteins. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins."

These projections imply an increase of nearly 40% in the Black−White life expectancy gap, from 3.6 y to over 5 y, thereby eliminating progress made in reducing this differential since 2006."

However, the mechanisms that regulate the timing and quantity of nutrient delivery are poorly understood. Here, we show that the squid Euprymna scolopes regulates the provision of a single glycan, chitin, to its symbiotic bacterium, Vibrio fischeri, in a diel rhythm that is synchronized with the host’s circadian clock. We also show that the timing of chitin delivery is critical for the persistence of the symbiosis, and that the glycan must be catabolized by the bacterium to maintain a healthy symbiosis. These results suggest that the timing of nutrient delivery may be a general mechanism used by animals to regulate the health of their symbiotic associations. This mechanism may be particularly important in the case of animals that live in complex environments, where the timing of nutrient delivery may be more critical than the quantity of nutrients provided.

We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete."

Therefore, it is difficult to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility, which resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

These data expand our understanding of the pathophysiology of Stormorken syndrome and suggest new therapeutic approaches for patients with this disorder. (Show more)"

Here we use a Drosophila model of Huntington’s disease to study the spread of protein aggregates in the brain. We show that aggregates accumulate at synaptic terminals and progressively spread throughout the brain. These aggregates are internalized and accumulate within other neurons, demonstrating that they are not cleared by the immune system. We also show that the spread of aggregates is dependent on endocytosis, and that this is required for the loss of vulnerable neurons. Finally, we show that the release of aggregates requires fusion protein 1, demonstrating that active release and uptake of aggregates are important elements of spreading and disease progression. These results provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the spread of protein aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases. (Show more)"

Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions in ALS are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. To explain the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in the brain and spinal cord, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

These mutations severely compromised virus infection, but had little effect on infection into other cell types. Consistent with these findings, the uncleaved S proteins were more infectious than the precleaved S proteins because they were more resistant to conformational changes that restrict the fusion-activating cleavages. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence.

Here, we show that the zebrafish genome encodes three genes that encode ligands for Alk and Ltk. We demonstrate that these ligands are essential for zebrafish pigment development and that they are required for Ltk activity. These experiments establish a physiological link between augmentor ligands and Ltk and demonstrate that particular augmentors activate Ltk in a tissue-specific context to induce iridophore differentiation from neural crest-derived cells and pigment progenitor cells. This work provides insights into the function of Alk and Ltk in the development of the zebrafish eye and pigment cells and may have implications for the development of human eye and pigment cell tumors.

Indeed, STING deficiency caused glucose intolerance due to impaired insulin secretion, indicating that STING is required for normal β-cell function. These data revealed a function of STING in the regulation of insulin secretion and established pathophysiological significance of fine-tuned STING within β-cells and insulin target tissues for maintaining glucose homeostasis.

Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus. This interaction is required for optimal viral replication and favors the copackaging of the interacting viral RNA segments. Our experiments indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions.

Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

Our results highlight that the impacts of global warming on ecosystem functioning will be exacerbated if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits. This is a key finding because the majority of species are expected to be unable to tolerate the higher temperatures that are predicted to occur in the future.

Our results reveal that small streams can be a significant source of nutrients to lakes, especially in nearshore areas where they become trapped and overlap in space. Our findings suggest that nutrient management efforts should focus on small streams to reduce the ecological impacts of nutrient loading on valuable nearshore ecosystems. This approach could be applied to other large water bodies to help protect valuable coastal ecosystems from the impacts of nutrient loading."

We then use a mouse model of NMDAR-Ab encephalitis to show that the same parameter fluctuations that are tolerated in the in silico model of the control condition can induce paroxysmal EEG abnormalities in the mouse model when the same parameter fluctuations are not tolerated in the mouse model of the NMDAR-Ab condition. These findings offer mechanistic insights into circuit-level dysfunction induced by NMDAR-Abs. They also suggest that the same parameters that are altered by NMDAR-Abs may be altered by other forms of brain dysfunction, such as seizures.

We found that Fe levels, as reflected in transferrin receptor mRNA expression, were reduced in mice treated with the Fe chelator deferiprone. This reduction in Fe levels was associated with reduced levels of the lipofuscin pigments and reduced oxidative/degradation of the lipofuscin pigments in the presence of light. These findings indicate that Fe levels promote the oxidation and degradation of the lipofuscin pigments. This interpretation was supported by experiments showing that Fe chelation decreased the oxidation and degradation of the lipofuscin pigments in the presence of light.
