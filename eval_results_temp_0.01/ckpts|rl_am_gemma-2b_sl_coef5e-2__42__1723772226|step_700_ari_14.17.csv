In this paper, we provide a purely categorical approach to the foundations of quantum mechanics. The axioms are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. This addresses a question about the mathematical foundations of quantum theory raised in reconstruction programs such as those of von Neumann, Mackey, Jauch, Piron, Abramsky, and Coecke. The approach is based on the observation that the category of Hilbert spaces and bounded linear operators is equivalent to the category of continuous linear operators between the categories of probability spaces and Borel probability measures. This equivalence is a special case of a more general result about the equivalence of the category of Banach spaces and linear operators and the category of Banach spaces and bounded linear operators. The latter category is well known to be equivalent to the category of continuous linear operators between the categories of metric spaces and continuous functions.

Although the evolutionary origin of the myxozoan body plan has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the genomes of two myxozoans and a cnidarian, which reveals that the myxozoan body plan is highly reduced in terms of gene content and genome size. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insight into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block nuclear import of IFN-stimulated factors, which is a key step in the induction of antiviral genes. We found that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 to impair docking of the karyopherin/importin complex and disrupt nuclear import. We also show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its ability to antagonize the antiviral action of IFN. Our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the host immune response and may help in the development of new antiviral strategies. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1, but the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1.

We find that the probability of simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year increases to 86% under 4 °C warming, and the probability of simultaneous production losses greater than 20% increases to 20%.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because species-level identification of plant foods is prohibitively difficult with traditional methods. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species (six wild, one domestic) in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammal assemblages, and that diversity of large mammals may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This work highlights the importance of diet composition in understanding the ecology of large mammals."

However, the global load of plastic debris on the open ocean surface is still unknown. We show that the global load of plastic debris on the open ocean surface is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This discrepancy is explained by the selective removal of plastic debris by the ocean interior. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

The solar system is the only place in the universe where we can study the formation of the solar system. We determined the age of interstellar grains in the Murchison meteorite. The grains have ages of 3.9 ± 1.6 Ma to ∼3 ± 2 Ga before the start of the solar system ∼4.6 Ga ago. The grains condensed in outflows of asymptotic giant branch stars &lt;4.9 Ga ago that possibly formed during an episode of enhanced star formation ∼7 Ga ago. The grains acquired the bulk of their cosmogenic nuclides in the interstellar medium and not by exposure to an enhanced particle flux of the early active sun. This indicates that the solar system formed in a relatively short time after the formation of the first stars. This is in contrast to the idea that the solar system formed over a long period of time.

This resistance is mediated by the induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. In addition, we found that SREBP1-mediated lipogenesis is required for the ferroptosis-suppressing activity of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis in cancer cells.

The most common drugs for treating hypertension are the L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs). However, the adverse effects of LCCBs are a major concern. Here, we show that LCCBs activate the STIM/ORAI Ca2+ signaling pathway, which is a major pathway for Ca2+ influx in vascular smooth muscle cells. Our findings indicate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. This study provides a mechanism of LCCBs action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrates that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. (Show more)"

However, in contrast to congenital deficiency, this was not fatal. CTLA-4 deletion induced preferential expansion of Foxp3+ Treg cells. However, T cells from CTLA-4–deficient inducible KO mice were able to adoptively transfer the diseases into T cell-deficient mice.

APOE2 enhances the rate of phagocytosis of synapses by astrocytes, whereas APO4 decreases it.

We show that the nucleation of the body-centered cubic phase of iron is much easier than that of the hexagonal close-packed phase, which is the stable phase of iron at the inner core conditions. This mechanism reduces the required undercooling of iron nucleation, which provides a key factor in solving the inner core nucleation paradox.

We show that reptiles have not only small brains relative to body size but also low neuronal densities, resulting in average neuron numbers over 20 times lower than those in birds and mammals of similar body size. This has important implications for studies using relative brain size as a proxy when looking for evolutionary drivers of animal cognition."

We find that ADF is able to sever filaments under tension, but not under compression. We also find that the mechanical torque that is induced by the filament network on ADF-bound filaments is critical to boost severing. We propose that this mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. This mechanism is likely to be relevant to other actin depolymerizing factors as well."

Here we show that the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses the mechanical activity of its pili to sense surfaces and respond accordingly. This mechanosensory system is mediated by the type IV pili, a major surface adhesin, and involves the Chp chemosensory system, a chemotaxis-like sensory system that regulates cAMP production and transcription of hundreds of genes, including key virulence factors. The methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein-like chemosensor PilJ directly interacts with the major pilin subunit PilA. Our results thus support a mechanochemical model where a chemosensory system measures the mechanically induced conformational changes in stretched type IV pili. This finding demonstrates that P. aeruginosa uses pili as a sensor to regulate surface-induced gene expression and pathogenicity. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of this mechanosensory system will be important for developing new strategies to combat this pathogen. (Show more)"

However, the structural basis of their antifungal activity and the molecular mechanisms of action are not well understood. Here, we report the structure of a unique antifungal peptide from Medicago truncatula, which exhibits potent fungicidal activity against plant fungal pathogens. We also demonstrate that this peptide can bind to multiple bioactive phosphoinositides, and its activity is dependent on its ability to bind to the cell wall. These findings provide insights into the structural basis of antifungal activity and the mode of action of this peptide, which can be used to develop this class of peptides as a spray-on fungistat/fungicide. This is the first report of the antifungal activity of a plant peptide against plant fungal pathogens. This work also highlights the potential of plant peptides as a new class of biofungicides.

We used proteomics and isotopic labeling to characterize the posttesticular life history of the Drosophila sperm proteome and determine the extent of molecular continuity between male and female reproductive tracts. We show that the sperm proteome undergoes substantial compositional changes after being transferred to the female reproductive tract. Multiple seminal fluid proteins initially associate with sperm, but most become undetectable after sperm are stored. Female-derived proteins also begin to associate with sperm immediately after mating, and they comprise nearly 20% of the postmating sperm proteome following 4 d of storage in the female reproductive tract. Female-derived proteins that associate with sperm are enriched for processes associated with energy metabolism, suggesting that female contributions support sperm viability during the prolonged period between copulation and fertilization. Our research provides a comprehensive characterization of sperm proteome dynamics and expands our understanding of the critical process of sperm–FRT interactions. (Show more)"

The HSRL is capable of providing high-resolution observations of aerosol and cloud properties, especially water cloud microphysical properties. We use this technique to investigate the interactions between aerosol loading and water cloud microphysical properties. The observations show that the aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation.

We found that the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks an intracellular activation gate and normally shows no C-type inactivation. We also found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation.

We show that this interaction leads to an increase in the cytoskeletal tension of the red cell and a reduction in the bending modulus of the cell’s membrane. We isolate the changes in the cytoskeleton and membrane and show that reduction in the bending modulus is directly correlated with parasite invasion efficiency. These data suggest that the malaria parasite primes the erythrocyte surface through its binding antigens, altering the biophysical nature of the target cell and thus reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion.

Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. We find that the spider’s web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to sense the motion of web threads, which allows the spider to remotely detect and localize the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself. The outsourcing and supersizing of auditory function in spiders provides unique features for studying extended and regenerative sensing and designing novel acoustic flow detectors for precise fluid dynamic measurement and manipulation."

The intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are the first line of defense against the invading pathogens and maintain the homeostasis of the intestinal microbiota. Retinoic acid-related orphan receptor α (RORα) is a transcription factor that plays an important role in the regulation of intestinal homeostasis. Here, we report that RORα is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis by attenuating nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcriptional activity. We also demonstrate that RORα/HDAC3-mediated attenuation of NF-κB signaling controls the balance of inflammatory responses, and therapeutic strategies targeting this epigenetic regulation could be beneficial to the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, including IBD. This study provides a potential therapeutic target for IBD. (Show more)"

However, the mechanisms by which this is achieved remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the provision of a single glycan, chitin, is the cue that triggers the maturation of the symbiotic organ of the squid Euprymna scolopes. This glycan is released by the host’s immune cells, which migrate into the symbiotic organ just before dusk, where they lyse and release the glycan. We also show that the glycan is required for the persistence of the symbiont, which is dependent on the catabolism of the glycan by the symbiont. This glycan-catabolizing activity is required for the acidification of the symbiotic organ, which enhances the activity of the symbiont. We propose that this glycan-catabolizing activity is a general mechanism used by animals to control the composition of their symbiotic microbial communities. This mechanism may be particularly important in the case of bioluminescent symbionts, which are often associated with the maturation of the symbiotic organ."

The distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population.

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation. These results demonstrate that the translation and base-pairing functions compete for the same resource, the encoded protein. This is an example of a dual-function RNA that has evolved to control carbon utilization. (Show more)"

Neuroinflammation is also a major feature of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of MS. In this study, we found that ASK1, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase, is highly expressed in microglia/macrophages and plays a critical role in the generation and maintenance of neuroinflammation. ASK1 deficiency in microglia/macrophages ameliorated the early stage of EAE, whereas deficiency in astrocytes ameliorated the later stage of EAE. ASK1 in microglia/macrophages activated astrocytes to exacerbate neuroinflammation, suggesting a phase-specific role of ASK1 in the glial cell–microglia/macrophage interaction.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility in autism and suggests a potential therapeutic target. (Show more)"

To better understand the mechanisms of MERS-CoV infection, we engineered viruses with mutations that blocked sequential proteolysis, which is required for virus entry into cells. We found that these mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence. These findings may be relevant to the development of vaccines and antiviral agents. (Show more)"

These studies provide a broad systems-level view of how specific driver oncogenes remodel the surfaceome and the glycoproteome in a cell autologous fashion, and suggest possible surface targets, and combinations thereof, for drug and biomarker discovery.

NAD+ RNA appears to be produced cotranscriptionally because NAD+ RNA is also found on pre-mRNAs, and only on mitochondrial transcripts that are not 5′ end processed. These results define an additional 5′ RNA cap structure in eukaryotes and raise the possibility that this 5′ NAD+ cap could modulate RNA stability and translation on specific subclasses of mRNAs. This discovery has important implications for the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes. (Show more)"

We show that the expression of fibrous sheath interacting protein 1 (FSIP1) is up-regulated in TNBC and is associated with poor prognosis. FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 promotes autophagy, enhances AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreases mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. (Show more)"

We asked pairs of friends and strangers to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

These findings have important implications for the understanding of the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in the elderly. (PsycINFO Database Record"

However, the evolution of specialization is often considered a dead end, as it is difficult to evolve morphological and functional optimizations in separate structures. Here we show that siphonophores, a group of pelagic predators, can evolve specialization on different prey types, and that the evolution of their tentacles is linked to prey type. Our findings help understand the evolution of specialization in predators, and how it has shaped the present-day food web."

This study provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key derived characteristic of the human hand, the third metacarpal styloid process. The fossil provides the earliest evidence for the evolution of this feature, which is present in modern humans and Neandertals but not in early hominins. The fossil also suggests that the complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato. This study thus provides a new perspective on the evolution of the human hand. (Show more)"

The enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) provides these units, but cancer cells have a deficiency in the uptake of the glycine required for SHMT enzymatic activity. We have developed a series of small molecules that inhibit both SHMT1 and SHMT2, and show that these compounds are effective in cancer cells. We also show that one-carbon donor formate is a potent rescue of SHMT inhibition, but paradoxically increases the cytotoxicity of the inhibitor in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. This effect is rooted in defective glycine import, which is a targetable metabolic deficiency of this cancer type. These findings provide a rationale for the use of SHMT inhibitors in cancer therapy.

This study shows that natural landscapes such as forests can contribute to meeting both food and nutrition security goals. We found that deforestation over a 5-y period (2008–2013) led to a reduction in household fruit and vegetable consumption and thus vitamin A adequacy of diets. Conversely, we found that forest fragmentation over the survey period led to an increase in consumption of these foods and dietary vitamin A adequacy. This study has important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. We hope that this study will encourage further research on the role of natural landscapes in meeting food and nutrition security goals."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We hypothesize that the roaming of sauropods on Earth has had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants."
