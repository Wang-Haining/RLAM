We report the structure of ice II hydrate, which is a new phase of water. The structure is determined by in situ neutron diffraction at 480 MPa and temperatures ranging from 260 to 70 K. The guest atoms are enclathrated in water molecules to form ice II-structured hydrates. The guest atoms have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The resolved structure is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. The density distributions indicate that the vibration of guest atoms is mainly in planes perpendicular to water channels, whereas their distributions along the channels are further constrained by interactions between adjacent guest atoms. The results provide a new perspective on the structure of ice II and the nature of the guest atoms. They also provide a new route to study the structure of ice II at high pressure.

Here, we report the results of a comparative analysis of the genomes of two distantly related myxozoans and a cnidarian parasite. Our results show that the myxozoan genome is one of the smallest reported in animals and that the group has undergone a remarkable reduction in gene content. These results suggest that the transition from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic myxozoan was accompanied by a reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insight into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Read more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of the proton channel. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits the channel will further our understanding of the channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for the channel.

We quantify the magnitude of this risk for maize production and trade, the most important staple crop worldwide. We find that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields will increase to values much larger than present-day values in most major maize-producing and -exporting countries. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and to a decrease in mean yields. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. They also underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance. (Show more)"

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa in the field. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species (six wild, one domestic) in semiarid African savanna. We found that species differed in the proportion of their diets made up of grasses, and that species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption had the greatest overlap in diets.

We report here that the inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis, a form of regulated necrosis driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. This resistance is mediated by sustained activation of mTORC1 and the transcriptional induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central regulator of lipid metabolism. In addition, we show that the induction of ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells is accompanied by the development of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1)-mediated lipogenesis. Thus, the combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction may be a promising strategy for cancer therapy. This approach may be particularly effective in cancer cells with hyperactive PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling, such as those with loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), a common event in human cancer. This study may also provide a new perspective on the development of ferroptosis as a therapeutic target for cancer. (Read more)"

It was science-based, incorporated adaptive management, and was the first plan to use a land-ownership map to guide management. We show that the NWFP was effective in halting the decline of early-seral ecosystems, but that the policy failed to halt the decline of older forests. This failure is partly due to the continued expansion of clearcutting on private lands, which is not covered by the NWFP. The NWFP is now 25 years old, and it is time to evaluate its success. Our findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure. This will be critical to the long-term conservation of biodiversity in the Pacific Northwest. (Less)"

The development of new antibiotics is a major challenge, since the evolution of pathogens is a very fast process. Therefore, computational approaches are essential tools to this end, since their application enables fast and early strategical decisions in the drug development process. We present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. This study is a proof of concept that rational design can be successfully applied to antibiotic discovery. The results of this study are expected to contribute to the development of new antibiotics.

We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data.

The island is located ∼400 km from the east coast of Africa, but its genetic and linguistic traits are from both Southeast Asia and Eastern Africa. We used a grid-based approach to sample at high resolution the genomic diversity (including maternal lineages, paternal lineages, and genome-wide data) across 257 villages and 2,704 Malagasy individuals. We find a common Bantu and Austronesian descent for all Malagasy individuals with a limited paternal contribution from Europe and the Middle East. Admixture and demographic growth happened recently, suggesting a rapid settlement of Madagascar during the last millennium. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, there are geographic influences on the present genomic diversity, independent of the admixture, showing that a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. These results provide insights into the settlement history of Madagascar and the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across"

The isotopic evidence suggests that the oceans cooled from 70 ± 15 °C in the Archean to the present ∼15 °C. However, this interpretation has been subject to question due to uncertainties regarding oceanic isotopic compositions, diagenetic or metamorphic resetting of the isotopic record, and depositional environments. We here present a method for reconstructing the temperature of ancient surface environments based on the thermostability of ancestral enzymes. Our results suggest that Earth’s surface temperature decreased over geological time from ∼65–80 °C in the Archean, a finding consistent both with previous isotope-based and protein reconstruction-based interpretations. Interdisciplinary studies such as those reported here integrating genomic, geologic, and paleontologic data hold promise for providing new insight into the coevolution of life and environment over Earth history.

The invasion process is a complex event, and the mechanisms by which the parasite interacts with the host cell are poorly understood. Here, we show that the malaria parasite alters the biophysical properties of the RBC, which may facilitate invasion. We show that the parasite binds to glycophorin A (GPA) on the RBC surface and that this interaction leads to an increase in the cytoskeletal tension and a reduction in the bending modulus of the cell. These changes in the RBC are correlated with parasite invasion efficiency. This work suggests that the parasite primes the RBC surface through its binding antigens, altering the biophysical nature of the target cell and thus reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion. This finding would constitute a major change in our concept of malaria parasite invasion, suggesting it is, in fact, a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces working together to facilitate entry.

The impact of environmental factors on influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

This merge operation is applied equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity, and it is consistent with a neural implementation of a bottom-up or left-corner parser. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases.

This study also demonstrates the power of the global cloud-based platform, CZID, for pathogen surveillance. This platform is a valuable resource for the rapid analysis of large-scale pathogen surveillance. We hope that this study will encourage the use of mNGS in resource-scarce settings and the sharing of the data generated. We believe that this study will contribute to the global effort to combat the spread of emerging pathogens.

The stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is critical for every aspect of lagging strand replication. However, the stability of the human pol δ holoenzyme has never been determined. We designed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. We found that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. Our results suggest that the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is a key determinant of the rate of lagging strand synthesis and the fidelity of replication. This work provides a unique perspective on the structure and function of the pol δ holoenzyme and the implications for the replication of the lagging strand. This article is protected by copyright.

We connect changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities."

Here, we show that a human pathogen, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, modifies the gut microbiota of the vector, the Ixodes scapularis tick, to more efficiently colonize the tick. We demonstrate that Anaplasma modifies the tick microbiota by inducing the expression of antifreeze glycoprotein (iafgp), which alters the composition of the gut microbiota and the integrity of the peritrophic matrix. IAFGP binds the terminal d-alanine residue of the bacterial peptidoglycan cell wall, resulting in altered permeability and the capacity of bacteria to form biofilms.

However, the mechanisms by which the host regulates the composition of this community are poorly understood. Here, we show that the provision of a single glycan, chitin, by the host to its symbiotic bacterium, Vibrio fischeri, is critical for the maintenance of a healthy symbiosis. This glycan is delivered by host cells to the symbiotic organ just before dusk, when the organ is at its most active. The glycan is catabolized by the symbiont, which uses the resulting metabolites to maintain a healthy symbiosis. This study provides a mechanism by which the host may regulate the composition of the gut microbiota. It also suggests that other hosts may use the provision of specific nutrients to regulate the composition of their gut microbiota. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

We show that our method can identify topics that are not captured by existing structured variables and can provide a detailed quantitative picture of reporting about lethal violence and its gendered nature. Our method offers a flexible and broadly applicable approach to model topics in text data. We hope that our method will be useful to many domains.

The island is located ∼400 km from the east coast of Africa, but its genetic and linguistic traits are from both Southeast Asia and Eastern Africa. We used a grid-based approach to sample at high resolution the genomic diversity (including maternal lineages, paternal lineages, and genome-wide data) across 257 villages and 2,704 Malagasy individuals. We find a common Bantu and Austronesian descent for all Malagasy individuals with a limited paternal contribution from Europe and the Middle East. Admixture and demographic growth happened recently, suggesting a rapid settlement of Madagascar during the last millennium. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, there are geographic influences on the present genomic diversity, independent of the admixture, showing that a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations.

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GlpD) and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the autism-risk genes and a potential target for the development of therapeutics.

One of the key metabolic pathways that supports cell growth is the one-carbon unit pathway, which is supported by the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). We have developed a small-molecule inhibitor of SHMT, and show that it is effective in cancer cell lines. We also show that the one-carbon donor formate is a potent rescue of SHMT inhibition, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in a cancer cell-line screen. We show that formate is a potent inhibitor of glycine import in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a cancer type that is uniquely dependent upon SHMT enzymatic activity for glycine import. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. This work provides a foundation for the development of a new class of cancer therapeutics.

We show that the proteins that form inclusions in the brain and spinal cord of ALS patients are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. Rather, these proteins are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. This metastable protein hypothesis may provide a unifying framework for understanding the pathogenesis of ALS and other neurodegenerative disorders. (Read more)"

An optical conveyor technique is presented for continuously loading atoms into the desired trapping positions with optimal coupling to the photonic crystal. The device configuration also enables application of optical tweezers for controlled placement of atoms. Devices can be fabricated reliably from a 200-nm silicon nitride device layer using a lithography-based process, producing predicted optical properties in transmission and reflection measurements. These 2D photonic crystal devices can be readily deployed to experiments for many-body physics with neutral atoms and engineering of exotic quantum matter.

The development of atherosclerotic lesions is a complex process that involves a series of events, including the activation of proatherosclerotic phenotypes of vascular cells. The objective of this study is to investigate the functional role of Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) in the disturbed flow-induced activation of proatherosclerotic phenotypes of vascular cells. Our results demonstrate that the activation of YAP/TAZ by disturbed flow is critical for the development of atheroprone phenotypes and atherosclerotic lesion formation. Therefore, inhibition of YAP/TAZ activation is a promising athero-protective therapeutic strategy. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the disturbed flow-induced activation of proatherosclerotic phenotypes and atherogenesis.

We connect changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities."

However, the mechanisms underlying the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis are poorly understood. Here, we show that the metabolic and molecular responses of the coral host to heat stress are secondary to the altered cycling of nutrients within the coral–algal symbiosis. We demonstrate that the catabolism of amino acids during heat stress increases the demand for energy, which is met by the degradation of amino acids. The resulting shift from net uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont subsequently promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host. Our findings provide a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

The dysregulated microbiome, in turn, triggers a regenerative response in the tumor, leading to a vicious cycle.

We also find that the humanized anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab, which inhibits the binding of ROR1 to its ligands, suppresses the expression of genes associated with breast cancer stemness, reduces activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or BMI1, and impairs the capacity of breast cancer cells to metastasize or reengraft mice.

The disease is associated with the loss of dopamine-containing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, which is the primary target of the nigral system. However, the disease also affects the nigral system, which is the only known pathway that innervates the dopamine neurons. Here, we show that the nigral system is composed of three functionally distinct subsystems. We also show that the loss of dopamine neurons is associated with the loss of dopamine-containing neurons in the striosome–dendron bouquets, which are specialized integrative units within the dopamine-containing nigral system. Our findings suggest that the dopamine-containing nigral system is more complex than previously thought and that the disease is associated with the loss of these specialized integrative units. This may have implications for the development of treatments for Parkinson’s disease."

We show that small tributaries can be a significant source of nutrients to coastal areas, especially in large lakes. Our findings suggest that nutrient management efforts should be expanded to small watersheds to reduce the ecological impacts of nutrient loading on valuable nearshore ecosystems. This will require a better understanding of the sources and fate of nutrients in small watersheds, as well as the development of effective nutrient management strategies for these areas.
