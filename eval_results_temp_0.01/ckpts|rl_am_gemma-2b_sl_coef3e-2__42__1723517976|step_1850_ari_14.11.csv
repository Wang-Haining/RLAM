In this work, we report the structure of ice II hydrate, which is a new phase of water. The structure of ice II hydrate is determined by in situ neutron diffraction at 480 MPa and temperatures ranging from 260 to 70 K. The guest atoms are enclathrated in water molecules to form ice II-structured hydrates. The guest atoms have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. This work provides a new route to study the structure of ice II and its hydrates, which are of great importance in understanding the properties of water under high-pressure conditions.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of the proton channel. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric channel. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on the channel: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits the channel will further our understanding of the channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for the channel.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species of wild and domestic LMH in semiarid African savanna. We found that, despite being similar in body size and proportional grass consumption, these species differed in diet composition, and that dietary overlap was greatest between species that were dissimilar in these traits. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our findings have implications for the management of LMH populations and the conservation of biodiversity in African savanna. (Show more)"

Our analyses resolved previously controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, plant cell wall-degrading enzymes obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, both major independent origins of specialized herbivory in beetles coincide with the first appearances of these genes.

Here, we report a novel role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes. We also found that APOE alleles affect the rate of accumulation of senescent synapses in the brain, which may contribute to the increased vulnerability of APOE4 to complement-mediated neurodegeneration. These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes.

This is a major change in our concept of malaria parasite invasion, suggesting it is, in fact, a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces working together to facilitate entry. This is a major advance in our understanding of the invasion process. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that housing mice in low humidity increases the severity of influenza virus infection. We found that low humidity impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide insights into the role of ambient humidity in the severity of influenza virus infection and may help to develop strategies to mitigate the impact of influenza virus outbreaks.

This pattern of activity is consistent with a merge operation that applies equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity. More superficial models of language, based solely on sequential transition probability over lexical and syntactic categories, only captured activity in the posterior middle temporal gyrus. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases.

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, HM predicted men’s and women’s support for Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. In addition, HM was associated with less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors.

We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells.

These results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This approach may be applicable to other cancers as well."

We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting.

This glycan is required for the maintenance of the symbiont population and for the periodic acidification of the symbiotic organ, which increases the availability of oxygen to the bacteria. These results suggest that the provision of nutrients to symbiotic microorganisms may be a more general mechanism used by animals to regulate the activities of their associated microbiota.

This process is dependent on CRFR1+ cortical astrocytes, which are also able to release CRF and express CRFR1 and AQP4.

Our findings provide a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may help us to predict the fate of coral reefs in a changing climate."

Furthermore, we show that treatment of mice bearing breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) with a humanized anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab repressed expression of genes associated with breast cancer stemness, reduced activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or BMI1, and impaired the capacity of breast cancer PDXs to metastasize or reengraft Rag2−/−γc−/− mice. Finally, treatment of PDX-bearing mice with cirmtuzumab and paclitaxel was more effective than treatment with either alone in eradicating breast cancer PDXs. These results indicate that targeting ROR1 may improve the response to chemotherapy of patients with breast cancer."

However, the role of small tributaries in delivering nutrients to coastal areas has been largely overlooked. We show that the 6 largest tributaries of Lake Michigan account for ∼70% of the daily nutrient loads delivered to the lake. However, the remaining 235 tributaries are responsible for the majority of the nutrient loads that are delivered to the nearshore zone. These small tributaries are also more likely to deliver nutrients in dissolved forms, which are more bioavailable to algae. Our findings highlight the importance of small tributaries in driving coastal nutrient pollution and suggest that nutrient management efforts should focus on these areas to reduce the ecological impacts of nutrient pollution on valuable nearshore ecosystems.

This behavior is reminiscent of the dynamics of complex systems that are biased toward rare events, such as the stock market."

Here, we present an integrated proxy (carbon and uranium [U] isotopes and paleo CO2) and multicomponent modeling approach to investigate an abrupt C perturbation and global warming event (∼304 Ma) that occurred during a paleo-glacial state. We report pronounced negative C and U isotopic excursions coincident with a doubling of atmospheric CO2 partial pressure and a biodiversity nadir. The isotopic excursions can be linked to an injection of organic matter–derived C over ∼300 kyr and to near 20% of areal extent of seafloor anoxia. Earth system modeling indicates that widespread anoxic conditions can be linked to enhanced thermocline stratification and increased nutrient fluxes during this global warming within an icehouse. This study provides a new perspective on the history of carbon perturbation events and their potential role in the evolution of life."

However, the scheme has not been able to prevent the conversion of forests to oil palm, and the vast majority of certified areas still contain little residual forest cover. We argue that the RSPO must be able to demonstrate that it is having a positive impact on reducing deforestation in order to be considered a tool for conservation and climate change mitigation."

In humans, its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. In this study, we discovered a small molecule that binds to the EXO70 subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and offers a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

In species with polygenic sex determination, multiple genes interact to determine sex, allowing for more than two sexes. Here we show that the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii has four possible sex classes, which are produced by the interaction of two alleles at a sex determination locus. We show that the modularity of secondary sexual characteristics produced by polygenic sex determination provides context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations. Our results suggest that the modularity of secondary sexual characteristics may be a general consequence of polygenic sex determination. This modularity may be important for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations."

We sought to understand the role of iron in the retina, given that iron is a key component of the Fenton chemistry that generates reactive oxygen species. We found that iron, as reflected in transferrin receptor expression, was reduced in albino mice with increased levels of bisretinoids. In addition, we found that iron reduced the oxidative/degradation of the bisretinoid A2E in the presence of light and reduced cell death in cell-based experiments. These findings suggest that iron may be a key factor in the photooxidation and photodegradation of retinal pigments. This work provides a mechanistic understanding of the role of iron in the retina and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for retinal diseases. (PsycINFO Database Record"

However, the evolution of predator specialization is often considered a dead end, because of the constraints associated with the evolution of morphological and functional optimizations throughout the organism. Here we show that the evolution of the feeding strategy of a group of predators, the siphonophores, is not a dead end, but rather a case of morphological evolution that has allowed the diversification of the feeding strategies of this group."

We have developed a strategy to inhibit the one-carbon unit biosynthetic enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), and show that this strategy is effective in blocking the growth of colon cancer xenografts. We have also identified a set of small-molecule dual inhibitors of SHMT1 and SHMT2, and show that these compounds are effective in inhibiting SHMT enzymatic activity. Finally, we have identified a subset of B-cell cancers that are uniquely sensitive to SHMT inhibition, and show that this sensitivity is rooted in defective glycine import. Thus, we have identified a metabolic vulnerability of B-cell cancers that can be exploited therapeutically. These findings have implications for the treatment of a variety of cancers, and may lead to the development of a new class of cancer therapeutics."

We show that the increase in mechanization has led to the propagation of subsoil compaction into deeper soil layers, with the risk of soil ecological dysfunction now affecting 20% of arable land. This is a global problem that calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery, considering intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This study highlights the importance of considering the ecological history of the landscape when assessing the impact of modern agricultural practices. (Show more)"
