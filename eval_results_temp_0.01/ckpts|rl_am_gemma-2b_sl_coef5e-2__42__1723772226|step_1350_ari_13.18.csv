In this work, we report the synthesis and structure of a hydrate, neon hydrate, in which neon is enclosed in a host lattice of water molecules. The structure of neon hydrate is a clathrate structure, in which the guest atoms are enclosed in the host lattice. The guest atoms are free to move in the host lattice, and the structure is thermodynamically stable at high pressure and temperature. This work provides a new example of a clathrate structure and a new method to store gases at high pressure and temperature. This work also provides a new method to store gases at high pressure and temperature."

The evolutionary origin of this group has been elusive, but a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the genomes of two myxozoans and a cnidarian parasite. Our results suggest that the transition from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic myxozoan was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insight into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. Sperm cells are quiescent in the male reproductive system due to Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1 channels, but become active once introduced into the low-Zn2+-concentration environment of the female reproductive tract. How Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers, and grass consumption ranged from &gt;99% to &lt;1%. Grass consumption was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of grass consumption, indicating that RRA conveys reliable quantitative information about consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption, but dietary composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them.

Here we show that anxiety, a personality trait, directly influences social dominance in male outbred rats and identify an important mediating role for mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens. High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low-anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as decreased ATP and increased ROS production in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious individuals. We conclude that mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens is crucial for social hierarchy establishment and is critically involved in the low social competitiveness associated with high anxiety.

Our analyses resolved previously controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, both major independent origins of specialized herbivory in beetles coincide with the first appearances of an arsenal of PCWDEs encoded in their genomes. Beetle diversity thus appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding PCWDEs."

We show that force application switches the A1 domain to a second state with faster on-rate, providing a mechanism for activating VWF binding to platelets. This mechanism is important for the pathophysiology of VWD. The conversion of single molecule kon (s−1) to bulk phase kon (s−1M−1) and the kon and koff values extrapolated to zero force for the low-force pathways show remarkably good agreement with bulk-phase measurements.

The parasite, Plasmodium, uses a variety of mechanisms to invade the red blood cell (RBC) and cause disease. Here, we show that the malaria parasite uses a single protein, erythrocyte binding antigen 175 (EBA175), to bind to glycophorin A (GPA) on the RBC surface. We show that this interaction alters the biophysical properties of the RBC, reducing the energy barrier to invasion. This is a major change in our understanding of malaria parasite invasion, suggesting that the parasite and host cell are working together to facilitate entry. This work provides a new perspective on the malaria parasite invasion process and opens up a new area of research into the role of host cell biophysical properties in disease pathogenesis.

We find that the wispy, wheel-shaped orb web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to capture the sound-induced air particle movements that approach the maximum physical efficiency better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By sensing the motion of web threads, the spider remotely detects and localizes the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave, such as those emitted by approaching prey or predators. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,00"

One of the most important proteins involved in the replication of the lagging strand is proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). PCNA is a sliding clamp that is responsible for the replication of the lagging strand template. In this study, we show that the human pol δ is not bound to PCNA during DNA synthesis. This finding has profound implications for the replication of the lagging strand as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This study provides a unique perspective on the role of PCNA in the replication of the lagging strand. (Show more)"

Neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

The band structures of the 2D photonic crystals are predicted to produce unconventional atom–light interaction behaviors, including anisotropic emission, suppressed spontaneous decay, and photon-mediated atom–atom interactions controlled by the position of the atomic array relative to the photonic crystal. The device configuration also enables application of optical tweezers for controlled placement of atoms. Devices can be fabricated reliably from a 200-nm silicon nitride device layer using a lithography-based process, producing predicted optical properties in transmission and reflection measurements. These 2D photonic crystal devices can be readily deployed to experiments for many-body physics with neutral atoms and engineering of exotic quantum matter. The photonic crystals can be extended to other systems, such as cold Rydberg atoms, to explore new physics.

First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities."

Here, we show that the metabolic activity of the coral host is the primary driver of the functional breakdown of the symbiosis. We identify a feedback loop in which the catabolism of amino acids is used to compensate for the increased metabolic demand of the coral host. This process, in turn, promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a mechanism that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host. This study provides a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

Here we propose a model of memory that is based on the adaptive changes in the excitability of neurons. This mechanism is sensitive to context and serial order, and it can be used to bind information over time. We show that this mechanism is sensitive to context and serial order, and it can be used to bind information over time. This model of memory is not reliant on persistent activity, excitatory feedback, or synaptic plasticity for storage. Instead, information is maintained in adaptive conductances that reduce firing rates and can be accessed directly without cued retrieval. This work provides a step toward a computational neurobiology of language."

This is due to the presence of the cell wall, which is absent in mammalian cells and poses the dominant physical barrier to biomolecule delivery in plants. Here, we report the delivery of siRNAs to plants using DNA nanostructures. We show that the size, shape, compactness, stiffness, and location of the siRNA attachment locus on the DNA nanostructure are important for the delivery and gene silencing efficiencies. We also show that the delivery of biomolecules to plants is a complex process that depends on the endogenous gene silencing pathway. Our work establishes the feasibility of biomolecule delivery to plants with DNA nanostructures and both details the design parameters of importance for plant cell internalization and also assesses the impact of DNA nanostructure geometry for gene silencing mechanisms. This work is a significant step toward the delivery of biomolecules to plants for the study of plant biology and for the development of plant-based therapeutics."

We find that the long-time dynamics of such systems are biased toward states that exhibit a fine-tuned extremization of environmental forcing. This behavior is reminiscent of the “saddle-node” bifurcation, which is a well-known phenomenon in dynamical systems theory. We also find that the dynamics of the network are sensitive to the details of the environment, and that the system can exhibit a variety of behaviors, including chaotic dynamics. These results suggest that the dynamics of chemical networks in thermodynamic environments may be more complex than previously thought."

Despite the widespread use of certification as a tool to reduce this impact, the impact of certification on deforestation has not been well quantified. Here, we show that certification is associated with a 33% reduction in deforestation in Indonesia, the world’s largest producer of palm oil. However, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation."

In this study, we investigate the effects of multiple interacting sex determination alleles on the secondary sexual characteristics of a single species. We find that the interaction of multiple sex determination alleles can produce a modular system of sexual polymorphism, where the same genotype can produce different phenotypes. This system of sexual polymorphism is a result of the interplay of sex linkage and sex limitation, and the modularity of secondary sexual characteristics can be used to understand the evolutionary causes and consequences of the maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants."
