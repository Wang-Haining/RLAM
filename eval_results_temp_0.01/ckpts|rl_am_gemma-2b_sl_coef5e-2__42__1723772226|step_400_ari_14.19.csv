The structure of ice II has been determined by neutron diffraction at ambient pressure, but the structure of ice II under high pressure has not been determined. Here, we report the structure of ice II at 480 MPa and 260 K, which is the highest pressure and temperature that can be achieved in a diamond anvil cell. The structure of ice II is a hydrate of water, in which the guest atoms are enclathrated in the host lattices. This is the first example of enclathration in ice II. The guest atoms are not bound to the host lattices, and their motions are restricted by interactions between adjacent guest atoms. This study provides a new perspective on the structure of ice II.

Although the evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. To understand the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite, we compared the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the Myxozoa are a sister taxon to the cnidarian parasite Polypodium hydriforme and that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. These findings have implications for understanding the origin of parasitism and the evolution of the Myxozoa. (Show more)"

Our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because species-level identification of plant material is prohibitively difficult with traditional methods. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammal species in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammal assemblages, and that diversity of large mammals may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results have implications for the management of large mammal populations and the conservation of African savanna ecosystems."

We have identified the second Threonine residue within the TTVGYGD signature sequence of K+ channels as a crucial residue for this allosteric communication. A Threonine to Alanine substitution at this position was studied in three representative members of the K+-channel family. Interestingly, all of the mutant channels exhibited lack of C-type inactivation gating and an inversion of their allosteric coupling (i.e., closing of the activation gate collapses the channel’s selectivity filter). A state-dependent crystallographic study of KcsA-T75A proves that, on activation, the selectivity filter transitions from a nonconductive and deep C-type inactivated conformation to a conductive one.

A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals.

This resistance is associated with sustained activation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, which in turn activates sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. This study demonstrates that targeting mTORC1 sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis induction, and that SREBP1/SCD1-mediated lipogenesis is a key mechanism of ferroptosis resistance. These findings suggest that mTORC1 inhibition may be combined with ferroptosis induction to treat cancer cells with PI3K or PTEN mutation. This combination therapy may be effective in a wide range of cancers, including those with activating mutations in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. (Show more)"

The most common treatment for hypertension is the use of drugs that block the voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channel (Cav1.2). However, these drugs are associated with a higher risk of heart failure. Here, we show that the three major classes of LCCBs activate the store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which promotes vascular remodeling. Our findings indicate that LCCBs are more associated with heart failure than other antihypertensive drugs in patients. Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. This study provides a mechanism of LCCBs action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrates that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. This study may help to improve the safety of LCCBs. (Show more)"

We found that bird populations tracked changes in forest composition, but the NWFP failed to halt the decline of older-forest–associated bird populations. Our results show that the NWFP’s policy of reducing clearcutting has not been sufficient to reverse the decline of older-forest–associated bird populations. We conclude that the NWFP needs to be strengthened to halt the decline of older-forest–associated bird populations. We also show that the creation of early-seral ecosystems on federal land may impede the development of older-forest structure.

The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data.

One of the main virulence factors of P. aeruginosa is the ability to form biofilms, which are dense communities of bacteria embedded in a self-produced polymeric matrix. In this study, we show that P. aeruginosa uses its surface-associated pili to detect surfaces and to regulate its virulence.

We demonstrate that neurons produce a variety of potent immune factors, which are absent from glial cells. Moreover, we identify a neuron-specific inflammatory response, which may precede the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Thus, we propose that the Aβ-burdened neuron is a primary proinflammatory agent, implicating the intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ as a significant immunological component in the AD pathogenesis.

The results of our faunal analysis demonstrate that the Hellenistic (fourth–second centuries B.C.E.) site of Maresha, Israel, is the earliest site known today where economic exploitation of chickens was widely practiced.

These results are supported further by an extensive survey of faunal remains from 234 sites in the Southern Levant, spanning more than three millennia, which shows a sharp increase in the frequency of chicken during the Hellenistic period. We further argue that the earliest secure evidence for economic exploitation of chickens in Europe dates to the first century B.C.E. and therefore is predated by the finds in the Southern Levant by at least a century. We suggest that the gradual acclimatization of chickens in the Southern Levant and its gradual integration into the local economy, the latter fully accomplished in the Hellenistic period, was a crucial step in the adoption of this species in European husbandry some 100 y later."

In this study, we show that the RNA pyrophosphohydrolase RppH, which is inactivated by disulfide stress, is the predominant decapping enzyme in Escherichia coli cells experiencing such conditions. Unexpectedly, RppH prefers to decape N-glycolylneuraminic acid-capped RNA over its dinucleoside tetraphosphate counterpart, generating a one-nucleotide shift in the 5′ terminus. This shift is required to stimulate rapid RNA degradation by the endoribonuclease DprA. The unconventional manner in which RppH decaps Np4-capped RNA as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress.

We show that female-derived proteins become associated with sperm immediately after mating and that they comprise nearly 20% of the postmating sperm proteome. Our research provides a comprehensive characterization of sperm proteome dynamics and expands our understanding of the critical process of sperm–FRT interactions.

However, the ACI is complex and difficult to be well represented in current climate models. Progress on understanding ACI processes is hampered by inadequate observational capability. Here, we introduce a new instrument, the dual-field-of-view high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL), to investigate the ACI. The HSRL is capable of simultaneously profiling aerosol and cloud properties, especially cloud microphysical properties. We demonstrate the capability of the HSRL to investigate ACI. The observations show that increased aerosol loading led to increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius, but had no discernible increase on liquid water path. This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI. (Show more)"

The ancestral environmental temperatures thereby determined for these photic-zone organisms––shown in modern taxa to correlate strongly with NDK thermostability––are inferred to reflect ancient surface-environment paleotemperatures. Our results suggest that Earth’s surface temperature decreased over geological time from ∼65–80 °C in the Archean, a finding consistent both with previous isotope-based and protein reconstruction-based interpretations.

We propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. This study provides a new perspective on the BK channel’s unique properties. It also provides a possible explanation for the BK channel’s physiological roles and pharmacological targets. It may also help to understand the molecular mechanism of C-type inactivation in other K+ channels. (Show more)

Here, we used intracranial recordings to investigate how the brain builds syntactic structures. We found that high-gamma power increased with each successive word in a sentence but decreased suddenly whenever words could be merged into a phrase. This pattern of activity was consistent with a neural implementation of a bottom-up or left-corner parser, which compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases.

One of the main rewards plants offer to pollinators for visitation is nectar. Nesocodon mauritianus (Campanulaceae) produces a blood-red nectar that has been proposed to serve as a visual attractant for pollinator visitation. Here, we show that the nectar’s red color is derived from a previously undescribed alkaloid termed nesocodin. We identify a convergently evolved trait in two vertebrate-pollinated species, suggesting that the red pigment is selectively favored and that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation. This work provides insight into the evolution of a visually important trait in plants."

To understand how MERS-CoV spreads to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of two bat coronaviruses, HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. MERS-CoV, but not HKU4, has adapted to use human cells for efficient human cell entry, contributing to the enhanced pathogenesis of MERS-CoV in humans. These results suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions. Our findings also provide insights into the origin of MERS-CoV and the evolution of bat coronaviruses. (Show more)"

The polymerase responsible for this process, DNA polymerase δ (pol δ), is a large enzyme that requires a sliding clamp to replicate the template. The stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is critical for every aspect of lagging strand replication. We developed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. Our results indicate that pol δ maintains a loose association with the sliding clamp while replicating DNA. This behavior has profound implications for Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from the sliding clamp on stalling at a DNA lesion. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the unique properties of lagging strand replication in humans.

In the laboratory, RNA molecules can be replicated by RNA ribozymes, but the replication of RNA by RNA ribozymes has not been demonstrated. Here, we show that an RNA polymerase ribozyme can replicate RNA molecules, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of PCR. Furthermore, we show that the polymerase can synthesize a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and even tRNA. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins.

This pandemic is generally understood as the consequence of a singular introduction of Yersinia pestis, after which the disease established itself in European rodents over four centuries. To locate these putative plague reservoirs, we studied the climate fluctuations that preceded regional plague epidemics, based on a dataset of 7,711 georeferenced historical plague outbreaks and 15 annually resolved tree-ring records from Europe and Asia.

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete. These findings suggest that the dual-function RNA is a complex regulatory element that is likely to have evolved to control carbon utilization.

The etiology of autism is so complicated because it involves the effects of variants of several hundred risk genes along with the contribution of environmental factors. Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the converging functions of autism-risk genes and may facilitate the identification of the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms.

However, formate is toxic to cells, and paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in a subset of cancer cells. We show that formate toxicity is rooted in defective glycine import, and that this is a targetable metabolic deficiency of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

Rather, the coaggregating proteins have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence."

This paper provides a comprehensive design-based analysis of the effects of vote-by-mail on electoral outcomes. We use a difference-in-differences design to estimate the effects of universal vote-by-mail on turnout, vote share, and overall turnout. We find that universal vote-by-mail does not appear to affect either party’s share of turnout, does not appear to increase either party’s vote share, and modestly increases overall average turnout rates. These findings support the conventional wisdom of election administration experts and contradict many popular claims in the media. Our results suggest that vote-by-mail programs are unlikely to have a significant impact on the 2020 presidential election. However, our findings do not preclude the possibility that vote-by-mail could have a significant impact in future elections."

Network functionality was assessed by quantifying metabolic RSN expression in cerebral blood flow PET scans acquired at rest and during task performance. We found that the dominant RSN was deactivated during rest in healthy subjects and early Parkinson’s disease, and that this abnormality was partially corrected by dopaminergic therapy. In contrast, in Alzheimer’s disease, significant reductions in network expression were already present at diagnosis, progressing over time. Our results illustrate the potential of metabolic imaging to provide useful information regarding the resting organization of the brain in health and disease."

However, the role of FSIP1 in the progression and drug sensitivity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. Graphical abstract:"

However, these factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we use high-throughput experiments to investigate how changes in temperature affect the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We found that changes in temperature systematically altered the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures departed from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increased, meaning that more species were required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. Our findings have important implications for the conservation of biodiversity and the management of ecosystems under climate change."

We demonstrate that striatonigral fibers originating in striosomes form highly unusual bouquet-like arborizations that target bundles of ventrally extending dopamine-containing dendrites and clusters of their parent nigral cell bodies. These clustered cell bodies in turn project to the striatum as part of the classic nigrostriatal pathway. Thus, these striosome–dendron bouquets likely represent subsystems with the nigro–striato–nigral loop that are affected in human disorders including Parkinson’s disease. Given evidence that striosomes receive input from cortical regions related to the control of mood and motivation and that they link functionally to reinforcement and decision-making, the striosome–dendron bouquets could be critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease.

The photoreceptor-derived ROS are scavenged by the RPE, whereas the RPE-generated ROS are not. We show that the redox state of the intracellular iron pool impacts the oxidation and degradation of a bisretinoid that is photogenerated by the RPE-derived ROS. These findings have implications for the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in the elderly. They also suggest that the redox state of intracellular iron may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration. (Show more)"

They are a unique group of predators because their tentacles are specialized for prey capture, and because they are the only predators that use nematocysts exclusively for prey capture. We studied the evolution of siphonophore tentacles, and found that they are highly specialized for prey capture. We also found that siphonophore tentacles are highly modular, and that the evolution of new prey types is linked to the evolution of new tentacle types. Our findings suggest that the evolution of siphonophore tentacles has been shaped by the need to capture different prey types, and that the evolution of new prey types has been linked to the evolution of new morphological structures. These findings help us understand how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs."

The fossil record for the hominin hand between 800,000 and 1.8 My old is sparse, and the origin of the distinctive human hand morphology is poorly understood. Here we report the discovery of a hominin hand fossil from East Africa that preserves the third metacarpal styloid process, a key derived feature of the human hand that is absent in early hominins. This fossil provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of this key derived feature of the human hand. The discovery of this fossil also suggests that the distinctive human hand morphology arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo. This study provides new insights into the evolution of the human hand. (Show more)"

SHMT is up-regulated in cancer, and the mitochondrial isozyme is particularly important for cancer cell growth. Here we show that dual SHMT1/2 knockout blocks colon cancer tumor xenograft formation. We identify small-molecule dual inhibitors of human SHMT1/2, and show that formate generally rescues cells from SHMT inhibition, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We also show that defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. These results suggest that SHMT inhibition could be a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer, and that targeting the glycine metabolic pathway could be a promising therapeutic strategy for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. This work provides a foundation for future development of SHMT inhibitors as cancer therapeutics. (Show more)"

This is a significant finding given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. The results have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. This study also highlights the importance of considering the role of natural landscapes in meeting nutrition goals."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants."
