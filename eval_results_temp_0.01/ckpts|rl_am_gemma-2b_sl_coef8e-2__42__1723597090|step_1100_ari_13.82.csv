The structure of hydrate is also important for understanding the transport of gas in the ocean and the deep seabed. In this study, we report the structure of hydrate formed by the enclathration of neon into ice II. The structure of hydrate formed by the enclathration of neon into ice II is stable at high pressure and temperature. This structure is also consistent with the experimental results of the structure of hydrate formed by the enclathration of helium into ice II.

The most prominent reconstruction programs are due to von Neumann, Mackey, Jauch, Piron, Abramsky, and Coecke. They all attempt to provide a purely categorical axiomatization of quantum theory. The present paper provides a categorical characterization of Hilbert space and the category of operators on it. This addresses a question about the foundations of quantum theory raised in these programs. The characterization is purely categorical and does not presuppose any analytical structure. The paper also provides a categorical characterization of the category of Hilbert spaces. This is a significant advance because it is the first time that the category of Hilbert spaces has been characterized categorically."

Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. To gain insight into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite, we compared the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content.

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are critical for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We found that SARS-CoV-2 uses a viral accessory protein, Orf6, to block nuclear import of the cargo-receptor complex. We further show that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain. Our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. Our findings have important implications for the development of antiviral strategies against SARS-CoV-2. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. However, the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 channel. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1.

We use global datasets of maize production and climate variability combined with future temperature projections to quantify how yield variability will change in the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. We find that as the global mean temperature increases, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation (CV) of maize yields increases almost everywhere to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation (SD) of yields and a decrease in mean yields. For the top four maize-exporting countries, which account for 87% of global maize exports, the probability that they have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammals in semiarid African savanna. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers, and grass consumption varied from &gt;99% to &lt;1%. Grass consumption was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of grass consumption, indicating that RRA conveys reliable quantitative information about consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption, but dietary composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammal assemblages, and that large mammal diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results highlight the importance of diet composition in determining the extent to which species can coexist."

Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean.

In this study, we found that the activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis protects cancer cells from ferroptosis, a form of regulated necrosis driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. This resistance is mediated by the activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. In addition, we found that SREBP1 mediates the ferroptosis-suppressing activity of SREBP1 by inducing the expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a key enzyme in the production of monounsaturated fatty acids. Genetic or pharmacologic ablation of SREBP1 or SCD1 sensitized ferroptosis in cancer cells with PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway mutation. In xenograft mouse models for PI3K-mutated breast cancer and PTEN-defective prostate cancer, the combination of mTOR inhibition with ferroptosis induction showed therapeutic promise. These findings provide a rationale for the development of combination therapies that target the PI3K-AKT"

Here, we show that LCCBs activate Ca2+ signaling through the STIM/ORAI pathway, which is up-regulated in hypertension. Our findings have important implications for the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated.

To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346–1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats. This study may help to understand the history of plague and to predict the potential impact of future outbreaks. It may also help to develop strategies for the control of future plague epidemics."

However, the evolution of brain power, which is the product of both size and number of neurons, has been less studied. Here, we show that the evolution of brain power in amniotes is characterized by four major shifts. The first two shifts are related to the evolution of birds and mammals, which are two groups known for their cognitive prowess. The other two shifts are related to the evolution of core land birds and anthropoid primates, which are two groups known for their cognitive abilities. These results have important implications for studies using relative brain size as a proxy when looking for evolutionary drivers of animal cognition."

We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This study may help to clarify the role of TRAP1 in cancer and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies. (Show more)"

We used a grid-based approach to sample the island at high resolution, and we found that the Malagasy population is a mixture of Bantu and Austronesian populations, with a limited contribution from Europe and the Middle East. The distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, we found that a few centuries are sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations.

In this study, we report the discovery of a plant antifungal peptide, NCR044, which is expressed in the nodules of the model legume Medicago truncatula. We show that this peptide is highly active against multiple plant fungal pathogens, including Botrytis cinerea and Fusarium spp. It binds to plant fungal pathogens and causes cell death. The peptide is also active against fungal pathogens in the form of a spray. This study highlights the potential of plant antifungal peptides as a new class of fungicides. This work also illustrates the structural diversity of plant antifungal peptides and their unique mode of action. (Show more)"

In this study, we use proteomics to characterize the posttesticular life history of the Drosophila sperm proteome and determine the extent of molecular continuity between males and females. We show that the sperm proteome undergoes substantial compositional changes after being transferred to the female reproductive tract. Multiple seminal fluid proteins initially associate with sperm, but most become undetectable after sperm are stored. Female-derived proteins also begin to associate with sperm immediately after mating, and they comprise nearly 20% of the postmating sperm proteome following 4 d of storage in the female reproductive tract. Female-derived proteins that associate with sperm are enriched for processes associated with energy metabolism, suggesting that female contributions support sperm viability during the prolonged period between copulation and fertilization. Our research provides a comprehensive characterization of sperm proteome dynamics and expands our understanding of the critical process of sperm–FRT interactions. (Show more)"

We found that the BK channel’s normal closing is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. This study may help us understand the mechanism of the BK channel’s normal closing and its physiological and pathological functions. (Show more)"

The malaria parasite uses a variety of mechanisms to facilitate invasion of the RBC, including the binding of parasite surface proteins to the host cell receptor, glycophorin A. Here, we show that the binding of the malaria parasite erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 to the host cell receptor leads to a change in the physical properties of the RBC membrane, which is required for invasion. These data suggest that the malaria parasite primes the RBC surface through its binding antigens, altering the biophysical nature of the target cell and thus reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion.

In the temperate regions, seasonal influenza virus outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in ambient humidity. While low ambient humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our study provides insights into the impact of dry air on host defense and disease outcome, which may be useful for the development of strategies to mitigate the impact of influenza virus infection.

Whether and how the brain does this, however, remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the brain’s response to words varies with each successive word in a sentence but suddenly when words can be merged into phrases. This suggests that the brain performs a merge operation that applies equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity. More superficial models of language, based solely on sequential transition probability over lexical and syntactic categories, only captured activity in the posterior middle temporal gyrus. Formal model comparison indicated that the model of multiword phrase construction provided a better fit than probability-based models at most sites in superior temporal and inferior frontal cortices. Activity in those regions was consistent with a neural implementation of a bottom-up or left-corner parser of the incoming language stream. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases.

We show that soil management practices that reduce soil disturbance, diversify crop rotations, and integrate livestock can increase soil C storage and the amount of C stored in the more stable mineral-associated organic matter. These results highlight the potential of grasslands to sequester carbon and provide a framework for the development of climate-smart agricultural practices. Our findings also highlight the importance of rotational grazing in the management of grasslands and the need to better understand the role of grazing management in the sequestration of carbon in soils.

We identify three enzymes that are necessary or sufficient for the production of this pigment, and show that the same three enzymatic activities are present in the red nectar of the hummingbird-visited Jaltomata herrerae. Our findings suggest that the red color of nectar is a convergent trait that is likely to be favored by selection.

This behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA at a DNA lesion. Our results provide a unique perspective on the role of the PCNA sliding clamp in DNA replication and suggest that the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is a key determinant of the rate of lagging strand synthesis.

This polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of PCR.

Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis reveals corecruitment of RORα and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) on NF-κB target promoters and subsequent dismissal of CREB binding protein (CBP) and bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) for transcriptional repression. Together, we demonstrate that RORα/HDAC3-mediated attenuation of NF"

We also show that the squid regulates the provision of chitin to the symbiont at night, when the organ is actively producing light. This study provides a new perspective on the regulation of symbiosis, in which the host provides nutrients that are metabolized by the symbiont, which in turn modulates the conditions in the habitat of the host’s other symbiotic partners.

There is an urgent need for novel and more efficient therapies, ideally targeting AML stem cells that are essential for maintaining the disease. We show here that monoclonal antibodies targeting the IL1RAP (IL1R3) receptor on AML cells have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML.

The drought began in 2012 and has led to acute water shortages, groundwater overdraft, critically low streamflow, and enhanced wildfire risk. We find that the probability that precipitation deficits are also warm has increased over the past two decades. This increase is likely due to human activities, which have increased the probability that dry precipitation years are also extremely warm. The probability that precipitation deficits produce drought has also increased, and this increase is likely due to human activities. Thus, anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of co-occurring warm–dry conditions like those that have created the acute human and ecosystem impacts associated with the “exceptional” 2012–2014 drought in California."

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. As an alternative approach, extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying the convergence of the targets and functions of the autism-risk genes to facilitate mapping out causal paths. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a unique example of a convergent mechanism that is causally involved in autism. (Show more)"

However, the mechanisms underlying this condition are not fully understood. Here we show that hypobaric hypoxia induces cerebral edema in rats and that this process is associated with the release of corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) from the hypothalamus, which acts on the cerebral cortex via its receptor CRFR1. This leads to activation of astrocytes, which in turn release endothelin-1 (ET-1), which causes edema. These findings provide a mechanism for the development of cerebral edema in hypobaric hypoxia. This knowledge may be useful for the development of new therapies for this condition. (Show more)"

Therefore, the generation of ECs is a promising therapeutic approach for these diseases. However, the minimum number of transcription factors that directly induce EC development remains undefined. Here, we demonstrate that ets variant 2 (ETV2) alone can directly convert primary human adult skin fibroblasts into functional vascular endothelial cells (ETVECs). In coordination with endogenous FOXC2 in fibroblasts, transduced ETV2 elicits expression of multiple key endothelial development factors, including FLI1, ERG, and TAL1, and induces expression of endothelial functional molecules, including EGFL7 and von Willebrand factor. Consequently, ETVECs exhibits EC characteristics in vitro and forms mature functional vasculature in Matrigel plugs transplanted in mice. Our study indicates that the creation of ETVECs provides further understanding of human EC development induced by ETV2. This approach may be useful for the treatment of vascular disorders.

We show that humans have vastly expanded the spatial and seasonal “fire niche” in the United States, accounting for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. Human-caused wildfires disproportionally occurred where fuel moisture was higher than lightning-caused fires, thereby helping expand the geographic and seasonal niche of wildfire.

But how do we know when two people are connected? We asked pairs of friends and strangers to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

In this study, we show that the evolution of siphonophore predators has been shaped by the diversification of prey types. Our results show that siphonophore specialists can evolve into generalists, and that specialists on one prey type have directly evolved into specialists on other prey types. These findings help us understand how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs. They also provide a broader perspective on predatory niche diversification via morphological innovation and evolution."

The study of the hominin hand is complicated by the paucity of hand fossils in the hominin fossil record between 800,000 and 1.8 My old, a time interval well documented for the emergence and subsequent proliferation of Acheulian technology. We show that the third metacarpal styloid process, a key derived hand feature in modern humans and Neandertals, was present ∼1.42 Mya in an East African hominin from Kaitio, West Turkana, Kenya. This fossil thus provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key shared derived characteristic of modern human and Neandertal hand morphology and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato. This study also highlights the potential for fossils from East Africa to provide important insights into the evolution of the hominin hand. (Show more)"

The enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) provides these units, but cancer cells have evolved to have high levels of the enzyme, which is why it has been a target for cancer therapy. Here we show that a small molecule that inhibits SHMT in normal cells also inhibits SHMT in cancer cells, and that this inhibition leads to cell death. We also show that cancer cells have a unique metabolic defect that makes them dependent on SHMT activity to meet their demand for one-carbon units. Thus, targeting SHMT in cancer cells may be a promising strategy for cancer therapy. (Show more)"

This study shows that deforestation can reduce people’s consumption of fruits and vegetables and thus their vitamin A intake. Conversely, forest fragmentation can increase consumption of fruits and vegetables and thus vitamin A intake. These findings have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. The study also highlights the importance of using causal inference methods to understand the impact of deforestation on people’s diets. This is a relatively new field of research and one that is likely to become increasingly important in the future."

This study shows that the weight of farm machinery has contributed to a global trend of subsoil compaction, with the risk of subsoil compaction now affecting 20% of arable land. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants.
