The most promising approach to their solution is to develop a mathematical theory that is able to capture the essential features of quantum mechanics. In this paper, we develop such a theory, which we call “Hilbert space quantum mechanics.” The theory is based on a categorical approach to the foundations of mathematics. This approach is free of any analytical structure and is therefore applicable to any mathematical structure that can be represented by a category. We show that Hilbert space quantum mechanics is equivalent to a category of continuous linear operators on Hilbert spaces. This result provides a mathematical foundation for quantum mechanics that is free of any assumptions about the nature of space and time."

Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we present the first genomic and transcriptomic analyses of two distantly related myxozoan species, Kudoa iwatai and Myxobolus cerebralis, and compare these to the transcriptome and genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. These results have implications for understanding the origin of the Myxozoa and the evolution of parasitic lifestyles. (Less)"

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

However, the number of trainable parameters in these networks is often very large, which makes it difficult to train the networks with large datasets. In this work, we introduce a network architecture that is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters, and is easier to train and apply in practice. The proposed architecture is based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters, and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters. We also show that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data."

We show that the Osmium isotope composition of the YDB magnetic grains is consistent with a terrestrial origin, and the YDB site in Pennsylvania is remarkable in yielding 2- to 5-mm diameter spherules containing minerals such as suessite that form at temperatures in excess of 2000 °C.

In this study, we demonstrate that the nucleation of the inner core is likely to be the two-step process, in which the bcc phase is the first stable phase to nucleate, and then the hcp phase nucleates from the bcc phase. This mechanism reduces the required undercooling of iron nucleation, which provides a key factor in solving the inner core nucleation paradox.

We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 may act as a tumor suppressor in some settings. These data suggest that TRAP1 may be a promising target for cancer therapy. (PsycINFO Database Record"

It is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell migration, cell division, and cell differentiation. However, the mechanism by which ADF regulates actin dynamics is not fully understood. Here, we show that ADF can induce a mechanical torque on actin filaments, which enhances severing. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical for ADF to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. Our results provide a mechanism for how ADF can regulate the mechanical properties of the actin cytoskeleton. They also provide a general mechanism for how mechanical forces can enhance the activity of proteins that bind to filaments.

The distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population.

Here, we show that the malaria parasite uses a single protein, erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 (EBA175), to bind to a single host cell receptor, glycophorin A (GPA), and that this interaction alters the biophysical properties of the RBC. We show that the reduction in the bending modulus of the RBC membrane is correlated with parasite invasion efficiency. This finding suggests that the malaria parasite primes the RBC surface through its binding antigens, altering the biophysical nature of the target cell and thus reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion. This is a major change in our concept of malaria parasite invasion, suggesting it is, in fact, a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces working together to facilitate entry. (Less)"

We show that differential regulation of the two genes on the transcriptional and proteostatic level confers differential responsiveness that can be used in tissue-specific regulation. Such subtle features may distinguish other redundant gene pairs that are commonly found in vertebrates through gene knockout experiments.

The auditory organs of these animals are extremely diverse in anatomy after hundreds of millions of years of evolution, yet they are all made up of cellular tissue and are morphologically part of the body. Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. We find that the spider’s web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to sense the motion of web threads, which is better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself. The outsourcing and supersizing of auditory function in spiders provides unique features for studying extended and regenerative sensing and designing novel acoustic flow detectors for precise fluid dynamic measurement and manipulation.

However, the genetic history of the period between the migrations and the invasions is largely unknown. Here we present a genome-wide analysis of a group of women from Bavaria, Germany, who had been deformed by cranial cranial deformation. The analysis of their collective genetic ancestry suggests that they had a genetic background that was very different from that of the rest of the population. In addition, we show that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago. These findings contribute to our understanding of the genetic history of Europe and provide insights into the processes that shaped the modern European genetic landscape. (Less)"

The results suggest that the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of bat coronaviruses are dependent on the host species. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmission. These findings are important for understanding the origin of MERS-CoV and the evolution of bat coronaviruses. They also provide insights into the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV in humans.

We used a global cloud-based metagenomic sequencing platform to identify the pathogens responsible for undifferentiated febrile illness in a periurban population in Cambodia. We found that vector-borne pathogens were the most common cause of undifferentiated febrile illness, but that underappreciated zoonotic pathogens, such as Plasmodium knowlesi, leptospirosis, and coinfecting HIV, were also common. Our findings underscore the importance of ongoing pathogen surveillance in resource-scarce settings, where epidemics are likely to emerge, and demonstrate the feasibility of pathogen surveillance using a global cloud-based metagenomic sequencing platform. This approach can help identify the breadth of endemic, zoonotic, or emerging pathogens and deployment of rapid public health response. (PsycInfo Database Record"

In this study, we developed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. We found that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This study provides a unique perspective on the structure and function of the pol δ holoenzyme and its role in DNA replication.

In the hypothesized RNA world, before the evolution of proteins, genetic information was stored in RNA molecules. In this study, we used in vitro evolution to improve the activity of an RNA polymerase ribozyme, which can synthesize RNA from an RNA template. The improved polymerase ribozyme can synthesize a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and, in low yield, even tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins.

We connect changes in the physical appearance of five US cities with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

We estimate life expectancy at birth and at age 65 y for 2020, for the total US population and by race and ethnicity, using four scenarios of deaths—one in which the COVID-19 pandemic had not occurred and three including COVID-19 mortality projections produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Our medium estimate indicates a reduction in US life expectancy at birth of 1.13 y to 77.48 y, lower than any year since 2003. We also project a 0.87-y reduction in life expectancy at age 65 y. These projections imply an increase of nearly 40% in the Black−White life expectancy gap, from 3.6 y to over 5 y, thereby eliminating progress made in reducing this differential since 2006. Our findings underscore the importance of addressing the structural inequalities that increase risk of exposure to COVID-19 and mortality risk for those infected. (Psy"

Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation. These results demonstrate that the translation and base-pairing functions compete. This is an example of a dual-function RNA that has evolved to control carbon utilization."

These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a framework for identifying the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms. It also provides a potential target for the development of behavioral therapies for autism.

First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

Here, we report the identification of a gene essential for the production of all the nitrogenous volatiles in tomato fruit. This gene encodes a flavin-dependent monooxygenase that catalyzes the formation of nitrogenous volatiles from their corresponding precursors. This work provides a major step forward in understanding the biosynthesis of volatile nitrogenous compounds in plants. (Show more)"

Here we use high-throughput experiments to show that the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is sensitive to changes in temperature. We found that the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning becomes steeper as temperatures deviate from ambient conditions, indicating that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This result is driven by two processes linked to the thermal tolerance of taxa. First, more diverse communities have a greater chance of including species with thermal traits that enable them to maintain productivity as temperatures shift from ambient conditions. Second, we found a pronounced increase in the contribution of complementarity to the net biodiversity effect at high and low temperatures, indicating that changes in species interactions played a critical role in mediating the impacts of temperature change on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function."

These clustered cell bodies in turn project to the striatum as part of the classic nigrostriatal pathway. Thus, the striosome–dendron bouquets likely represent subsystems with the nigro–striato–nigral loop that are affected in human disorders including Parkinson’s disease. Given evidence that striosomes receive input from cortical regions related to the control of mood and motivation and that they link functionally to reinforcement and decision-making, the striosome–dendron bouquets could be critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease. This system is likely to be of interest to a broad audience interested in the brain’s dopamine systems and their disorders. (PsycInfo Database Record"

We show that the increase in the weight of farm machinery has led to the propagation of compaction into deeper soil layers, which now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants.
