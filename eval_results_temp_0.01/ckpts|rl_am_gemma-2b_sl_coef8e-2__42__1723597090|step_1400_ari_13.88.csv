However, the structure of guest atoms in ice II has not been resolved. Here, we report the structure of neon hydrate at high pressure and low temperature. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. This finding provides a new route to the structure of guest atoms in ice II, which is important for the understanding of the deep interior of the Earth and the stability of hydrates.

We report the first genomic and transcriptomic assemblies for two species of myxozoans, and we compare these to the genome and transcriptome of a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results show that myxozoans are cnidarians and are a sister taxon to the less reduced cnidarian parasite, P. hydriforme. We also show that myxozoans have one of the smallest reported animal genomes, and that gene content and expression patterns are highly reduced compared to other cnidarians. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This is a major step forward in our understanding of the evolution of the Myxozoa. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to block the nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are essential for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We found that the viral accessory protein Orf6 is responsible for this activity and that it localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and interacts with Nup98-Rae1. Our results unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the host immune response and may lead to the development of new antiviral strategies. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

We use a statistical model to project the future variability of maize yields in the major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. We find that the variability of maize yields will increase substantially in most of these countries, and that the probability of simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year will increase. This instability in global grain trade and international grain prices will affect especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. We conclude that investments in breeding for heat tolerance are urgently needed."

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa in the field. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species of large herbivores in semiarid African savanna. Our results show that species that are similar in body size and proportional grass consumption have the greatest overlap in diet composition, suggesting that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages. Our results also show that species partition food resources, even when they are similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. These results suggest that plant diversity may be more tightly linked to LMH diversity than is currently recognized. This may have implications for the conservation of LMH in a world of limited resources."

The nature of the communication network between endothelial cells has been poorly understood. Here, the nature of the communication network between endothelial cells has been addressed using single-cell Ca2+ imaging across thousands of endothelial cells in intact blood vessels. The results reveal that the endothelium is a highly connected network with a small-world configuration. The small-world configuration confers particularly dynamic endothelial properties including high signal-propagation speed, stability, and a high degree of synchronizability.

We used a comprehensive dataset of 89 genes to estimate the timing and rates of beetle diversification, and a dataset of 154 genomes or transcriptomes to trace the evolution of genes enabling symbiont-independent digestion of lignocellulose. Our results show that plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, both major independent origins of specialized herbivory in beetles coincide with the first appearances of these genes in their genomes. We propose that these genes enabled efficient digestion of plant tissues, including lignocellulose in cell walls, facilitating the evolution of uniquely specialized plant-feeding habits, such as leaf mining and stem and wood boring. Beetle diversity thus appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding PCWDE"

The strongest genetic risk factor influencing susceptibility to AD is apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. APOE isoform is associated with an ∼twofold decreased risk for AD. APOE2 enhances the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes, whereas APO4 decreases it. We also found that APOE alleles are associated with different rates of C1q accumulation in hippocampus, which may represent the accumulation of senescent synapses with enhanced vulnerability to complement-mediated degeneration. These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes. They also suggest the hypothesis that AD susceptibility of APOE4 may originate in part from defective phagocytic capacity of astrocytes which accelerates the rate of accumulation of C1q-coated senescent synapses, enhancing synaptic vulnerability to classical-complement-cascade mediated neurodegeneration. This hypothesis is supported by the recent finding that APOE4 is associated with increased levels of C1q in the brain.

Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to study the action of ADF/cofilin in different mechanical situations. We find that mechanical tension has no effect on ADF/cofilin binding and weakly enhances severing. Remarkably, we observe that filament segments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist, experience a mechanical torque upon cofilin binding. We propose that this ADF/cofilin-induced torque increases the severing rate constant 100-fold. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. This work provides a mechanistic understanding of ADF/cofilin’s action and may lead to the development of new strategies for controlling actin dynamics."

In this study, we show that the brain’s reward system is activated more strongly by food cues in a fasted relative to a fed state. We also show that ingestion of fructose versus glucose results in greater activation of brain regions involved in attention and reward processing and may promote feeding behavior. These findings suggest that the brain’s reward system may play a role in the differential susceptibility of the obese to food cues and the obese’s preference for sweet foods. This may help explain why some people are more sensitive to the effects of fructose than others. These findings may also lead to the development of new strategies for treating obesity."

We used a grid-based approach to sample the island at high resolution, and we found that the island has been colonized by both Africa and Asia. The colonization happened recently, and the population has been shaped by a combination of admixture and demographic growth. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, there are geographic influences on the present genomic diversity, independent of the admixture, showing that a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations.

The isotopic record of the oceans, however, has been subject to question due to uncertainties regarding oceanic isotopic compositions, diagenetic or metamorphic resetting of the isotopic record, and depositional environments. We here present thermostability measurements of ancestral enzymes derived from light-requiring prokaryotic and eukaryotic phototrophs having widely separated fossil-based divergence ages. The ancestral environmental temperatures thereby determined for these photic-zone organisms––shown in modern taxa to correlate strongly with NDK thermostability––are inferred to reflect ancient surface-environment paleotemperatures. Our results suggest that Earth's surface temperature decreased over geological time from ∼65–80 °C in the Archean, a finding consistent both with previous isotope-based and protein reconstruction-based interpretations. Interdisciplinary studies such as those reported here integrating genomic, geologic, and paleontologic data hold promise for providing new insight into the coevolution of life and environment over Earth history.

They are classified into three types based on their gating mechanism: voltage-gated, ligand-gated, and calcium-gated. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel is a calcium-activated potassium channel that lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and shows no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. This study provides a new perspective on the gating mechanism of K+ channels. (Show more)"

We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden.

The virus is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. Our results suggest that the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5 are different, and that the adaptation of MERS-CoV to use human cells for cross-species transmissions is due to the capability of its spike to use human cellular proteases for efficient human cell entry. These results suggest that bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions. They also suggest that the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of bat coronaviruses are different. Thus, bat coronaviruses may be a potential source of novel coronavirus strains that can cause human diseases."

In humans, the lagging strand synthesis is performed by DNA polymerase δ (pol δ). Pol δ is a large enzyme that is composed of a catalytic core and a sliding clamp. The sliding clamp is responsible for the processivity of pol δ and is composed of two subunits, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and a clamp loader. The clamp loader is responsible for the loading of the sliding clamp onto the polymerase. In this study, we developed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. The results indicate that the pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA at a DNA lesion. This study provides a unique insight into the structure and function of the pol δ holoenzyme. This study also provides a foundation for the development of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of human diseases caused by mutations in the pol δ gene."

We show that this scale is a powerful tool for predicting and explaining many chemical phenomena under pressure.

We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. These results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. Furthermore, the results suggest that IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, and we show that an antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling can suppress the proliferation of primary human AML cells.

Our analysis reveals that the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration does not change with experimental warming in most biomes, but that respiration rates with and without experimental warming follow a Gaussian response, increasing with soil temperature up to a threshold of ∼25 °C, above which respiration rates decrease with further increases in temperature. This consistent decrease in temperature sensitivity at higher temperatures demonstrates that rising global temperatures may result in regionally variable responses in soil respiration, with colder climates being considerably more responsive to increased ambient temperatures compared with warmer regions.

We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

These findings establish a physiological link between augmentor ligands and Ltk and demonstrate that particular augmentors activate Ltk in a tissue-specific context to induce iridophore differentiation from neural crest-derived cells and pigment progenitor cells. This study provides insights into the role of RTKs in development and cancer. It also provides a model system for studying the role of RTKs in zebrafish.

Herein, we found that STING is required for normal β-cell function and is decreased in islets of db/db mice and patients with T2D. STING deficiency decreased expression of β-cell function–related genes, contributing to impaired GSIS. Mechanistically, the transcription factor Pax6 was down-regulated and its nuclear localization was lost in STING-βKO β-cells. These data revealed a function of STING in the regulation of insulin secretion and established pathophysiological significance of fine-tuned STING within β-cells and insulin target tissues for maintaining glucose homeostasis.

Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host. This provides a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general."

We asked pairs of friends and strangers to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

These findings suggest that iron may be a key factor in the development of retinal disease. This interpretation is supported by the observation that iron chelation reduced the oxidative/degradation of A2E in the presence of light and reduced cell death in cell-based experiments. Moreover, light-independent oxidation and degradation of A2E by Fenton chemistry products were evidenced by the consumption of A2E, release of dicarbonyls, and generation of oxidized A2E species in cell-free assays.

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. This alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the discovery of a 130-m-long, 10-m-wide, and 3-m-deep trackway of a sauropod in the Morrison Formation of Colorado. This trackway provides a unique opportunity to study the effects of large animals on the landscape"
