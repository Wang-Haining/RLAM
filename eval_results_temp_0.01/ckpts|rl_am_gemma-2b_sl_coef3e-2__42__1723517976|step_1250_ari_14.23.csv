However, the structure of the hydrate phase, which is the most stable phase of water at high pressure, has not been resolved. Here, we report the structure of the hydrate phase of water at high pressure and temperature. We demonstrate that neon atoms can be enclathrated in water molecules to form ice II-structured hydrates. This finding has implications for the structure of the hydrate phase, which is the most stable phase of water at high pressure and temperature. It also has implications for the structure of the liquid phase, which is the most stable phase of water at low pressure."

We also show that the myxozoan genome is highly reduced in gene content, and we identify candidate genes that are missing in the myxozoan lineage.

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to block the nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are essential for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We found that the viral accessory protein Orf6 is responsible for this activity and that it does so by directly interacting with the Nup98-Rae1 complex, which is essential for the nuclear import of ISGs. Our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the host immune response and may help in the development of new antiviral strategies. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1, but the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1.

This increase in variability will increase the probability of simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year in the top four maize-exporting countries, which account for 87% of global maize exports.

However, the extent to which species differ in their diets is unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa in the field. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species of large herbivores in semiarid African savanna. We found that the degree of diet overlap between species was correlated with the degree of overlap in the proportion of plant species consumed. This suggests that the degree of diet overlap between species may be a useful indicator of competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages. Our results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This may have implications for the management of large herbivore populations."

This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

The development of new antibiotics is a major challenge, since the evolution of pathogens is fast and efficient. We present a rational design approach to identify new acylide antibiotics that are active against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. We show that the design strategy is effective, since the best compounds designed by us are up to 56 times more active than telithromycin, a clinically used antibiotic, against resistant pathogens. Notably, the best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. The design strategy presented here can be used to develop new antibiotics against other antibiotic-resistant pathogens. (Show more)"

Here, we report a novel role for APOE in regulating the rate of astrocytic phagocytosis of synapses, which is highly dependent on APOE isoform. We also found that APOE alleles are highly associated with the accumulation of a complement component in senescent synapses, which may contribute to the increased vulnerability of these synapses to complement-mediated neurodegeneration.

Here, we show that oligomeric Aβ is not required for the initiation of an inflammatory response in the brain, since neighboring glial cells also produce a variety of immune factors. However, we demonstrate that the intraneuronal accumulation of oligomeric Aβ is a significant contributor to the neuroinflammatory response, since neighboring glial cells do not express similar molecules. Thus, we identify the intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ as a significant immunological component in the AD pathogenesis. This study provides a better understanding of the complex interplay between the brain’s immune system and the neurodegenerative process, and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies."

This unique manner of substrate recognition positions the δ-phosphate, rather than the β-phosphate, for hydrolytic attack, generating triphosphorylated RNA as the primary product of decapping. The differential impact of RppH on the rates at which capped and noncapped 5′ termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress."

However, ACI is difficult to be well represented in current climate models. This is due to the complexity of ACI processes, such as the influence of aerosols on water cloud droplet formation. To overcome this conundrum, we introduce the dual-field-of-view (FOV) high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) for simultaneously profiling aerosol and water cloud properties, especially water cloud microphysical properties. This instrument, verified by the Monte Carlo simulation and coincident observations of other techniques, was used to investigate the interactions between aerosol loading and water cloud microphysical properties. The observed water cloud profiles identify that due to air entrainment its vertical structure is not perfectly adiabatic, as assumed by many current retrieval methods. This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations obtained from the dual-FOV HSRL constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI process. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI."

The Plasmodium parasite uses a number of mechanisms to invade the red blood cell, the target of the disease. Here, we show that the parasite erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 (EBA175) binds to glycophorin A (GPA) on the red cell surface and alters the biophysical properties of the cell. We show that the reduction in the bending modulus of the cell membrane is correlated with parasite invasion efficiency. These data suggest that the malaria parasite primes the erythrocyte surface through its binding antigens, altering the biophysical nature of the target cell and thus reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion. This finding would constitute a major change in our concept of malaria parasite invasion, suggesting it is, in fact, a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces working together to facilitate entry.

In this study, we show that housing mice in low humidity makes them more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the impact of ambient humidity on influenza virus infection and disease outcome. (Show more)"

More superficial models of language, based on sequential transition probabilities, only captured activity in the posterior middle temporal gyrus. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases."

We used a grid-based approach to sample the genomic diversity across the island, which allowed us to study the distribution of the African and Asian ancestry in a fine-grained way. We find that the population of Madagascar is a mixture of Bantu and Austronesian populations, with a limited contribution from Europe and the Middle East. The settlement history of Madagascar is also complex, with a recent population growth and a sex-biased colonization. Finally, we find that the distribution of the African and Asian ancestry is not only a consequence of the admixture, but also of the demographic history of Madagascar."

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the core autistic symptoms and may facilitate the development of therapeutic strategies for autism. (Show more)"

Here, we show that the squid Euprymna scolopes regulates the activities of its luminescent symbiont, Vibrio fischeri, through the strategic provision of a single glycan, chitin. We demonstrate that the glycan is provided to the squid only at dusk, when the symbiotic organ is about to mature. This glycan is then metabolized by the symbiont, which is able to maintain a normal symbiont population level only until the organ reaches maturity. Finally, catabolism of the glycan by the symbiont is also required for a periodic acidification of the organ, which increases the level of oxygen available to the symbiont and enhances its capacity to produce bioluminescence at night."

We found that the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion. For the N3-EtdT lesion that disrupts base pairing, multiple transcriptional lesion bypass routes were found. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop). The Pro-Gate loop faces toward the minor groove of RNA:DNA hybrid and is involved in modulating the translocation of minor-groove alkylated DNA template after nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion"

Although the majority of breast cancers are hormone receptor-positive, the treatment of these cancers with chemotherapy is often necessary. In this study, we found that the expression of the type I tyrosine kinaselike orphan receptor ROR1 increased in breast cancer cells following treatment with chemotherapy. We also found that ROR1 expression was associated with the expression of genes induced by the activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or B lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region 1 homolog (BMI1). Finally, we found that treatment of mice bearing breast cancer patient-derived xenografts with the humanized anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab repressed expression of genes associated with breast cancer stemness, reduced activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or BMI1, and impaired the capacity of breast cancer PDXs to metastasize or reengraft Rag2−/−γc−/− mice. These results indicate that targeting ROR1 may improve the response to chemotherapy of patients with breast cancer. (Show more)"

These changes can lead to the development of paroxysmal EEG abnormalities, which can be triggered by small changes in the brain’s intrinsic dynamics. This work offers insights into the mechanisms underlying the development of paroxysmal EEG abnormalities in autoimmune encephalitis. It also provides a framework for understanding the effects of other neuropsychiatric disorders on the brain’s intrinsic dynamics. This may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for these disorders. (Show more)"

Here, we present a study that investigates a major global warming event that occurred during a glacial period. We use a combination of proxy data and modeling to show that the event was associated with a major injection of organic matter into the ocean and widespread anoxia. This event is a key example of how the Earth system can respond to abrupt warming and provides insights into the history of carbon perturbation events."

However, the impact of certification on deforestation has not been well studied. Here, we show that certification is associated with a reduction in deforestation in oil palm plantations in Indonesia. Nevertheless, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation."

In humans, its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. In this study, we discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 (exocyst component of 70 kDa) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

One class of ROS is generated by the metabolism of vitamin A aldehyde adducts (bisretinoids) that are photooxidized by light. The other class of ROS is generated by the metabolism of the iron (Fe) chelator deferiprone (DFP). We show that DFP reduces the oxidation of the bisretinoid A2E by light and DFP reduces the degradation of A2E by light-independent Fenton chemistry. These findings suggest that DFP may reduce the oxidative damage to the retina by reducing the Fe levels in the retina. This interpretation is supported by the observation that DFP reduces the accumulation of bisretinoids in albino mice with increased Fe levels in the retina. These findings have implications for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in the elderly.

In this study, we show that the evolution of predatory specialization in the marine cnidarian clade siphonophores has strong associations with prey type. This finding contributes to a broader perspective on the evolution of predatory niche diversification, and helps us understand how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs."

These features are thought to have evolved in the evolution of modern humans, Homo sapiens, and are thought to have played a role in the development of the distinctive tool-making abilities of the genus Homo. We report the occurrence of one of these features, a third metacarpal styloid process, in a Middle Pleistocene hominin from East Africa. This finding suggests that the evolution of the human hand was more complex than previously thought and that the distinctive tool-making abilities of the genus Homo may have evolved earlier than previously thought."

We have developed a series of small-molecule inhibitors of the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), which converts serine into glycine and a tetrahydrofolate-bound one-carbon unit. We show that these inhibitors are effective in vitro and in vivo, and that they are particularly effective in B-cell lines. We also show that one of the targets of SHMT inhibition is glycine import, which is defective in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Thus, we have identified a metabolic vulnerability of B-cell lymphoma that can be exploited therapeutically. This work provides a foundation for the development of a new class of cancer therapeutics.

We show that the weight of modern farm machinery has increased the risk of subsoil compaction, which is now widespread over 20% of arable land. This trend has the potential to reduce agricultural productivity, and we hypothesize that this is the case because of the negative effects of compaction on the growth of plants. We suggest that the roaming of sauropods, the largest animals that walked Earth, may have been a strategy to avoid compaction of the soil, and that this strategy may have guided the evolution of these giants."
