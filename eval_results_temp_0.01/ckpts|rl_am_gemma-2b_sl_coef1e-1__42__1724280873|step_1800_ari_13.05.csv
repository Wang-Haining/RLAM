This paper provides a new perspective on the foundations of quantum theory. We show that the category of Hilbert spaces and bounded operators is equivalent to the category of continuous linear functions between Hilbert spaces. This result is purely categorical and does not presuppose any analytical structure. It is therefore applicable to any theory that can be formulated as a category with a notion of continuity. The result has implications for the reconstruction of quantum mechanics from its observations, and for the foundations of quantum information theory."

Here, we report the results of a comparative analysis of the genomes of two myxozoans and a cnidarian parasite. Our results show that the myxozoan genome is one of the smallest reported in animals and that the group has undergone a remarkable reduction in gene content. In addition, we find that myxozoans have lost many signaling and transcriptional factors that are important for development in other animals. These results suggest that the transition from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic myxozoan was accompanied by a reduction in genome size and gene content. This is an important step in understanding the evolution of parasitism. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2 in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes. We found that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 evades the host immune response and may help in the development of new strategies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

However, the optimum growing temperature for maize is close to the current global mean temperature, and the temperature is expected to increase by 2 °C to 4 °C by the end of the century. We show that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields will increase to values much larger than present-day values, and the probability that the world’s major maize-exporting countries have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year will increase. This will have important implications for global grain trade and international grain prices, especially for the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty."

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is largely unknown because species-level identification is prohibitively difficult with traditional methods. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species (six wild, one domestic) in semiarid African savanna. We found that species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption had the greatest overlap in diet composition, but that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.

We show that the NWFP was effective in halting the decline of early-seral ecosystems, but that the policy has failed to reverse the decline of older forests. This failure is partly due to the fact that the NWFP did not halt clearcutting on federal land, which continues to be a major threat to older forests. The NWFP is a model for policy makers and managers, and our findings highlight the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the plan."

The development of new antibiotics is a major challenge, and computational approaches are essential tools to this end. Here, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. The best candidate is synthetically more accessible, exhibits higher solubility and binding affinity to the ribosome, and is up to 56 times more active against resistant pathogens than telithromycin. Notably, the best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

The network architecture is based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is easy to implement, train, and apply in practice. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data. This makes the network architecture easier to train and apply in practice."

However, this response is not observed in animal models of AD devoid of such pathologies, suggesting that the underlying processes may be different in the earliest stages of the disease. Here, we show that neurons, which are the primary cell type in the brain, are also the source of an inflammatory response in AD. This finding is significant because it suggests that the accumulation of soluble and oligomeric Aβ, rather than the formation of Aβ plaques, may be the primary cause of the AD-related inflammation. Thus, we propose that the Aβ-burdened neuron may be a critical target for the development of new therapeutic strategies. (Read more)"

The folding of the large maltose binding protein (MBP) is a model system for studying the folding of proteins with a complex sequence. We have developed a method that allows the study of the folding of MBP at high structural resolution. The method is based on the use of hydrogen exchange to monitor the folding of MBP in the presence of a large number of labeled residues. The results show that the folding of MBP is a multistep process. The folding intermediates are distinct and are not the same as the native state. The results are important for understanding the folding of large proteins. They also provide a model for the folding of other proteins. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

In bacteria, they function as precursors to nucleoside tetraphosphate (Np4) RNA caps. The predominant decapping enzyme in proteobacteria, ApaH, is inactivated by the very conditions of disulfide stress that enable Np4-capped RNAs to accumulate to high levels. Here, we show that, in cells experiencing such stress, the pyrophosphohydrolase RppH assumes a leading role in decapping those transcripts, preferring them as substrates over their triphosphorylated and diphosphorylated counterparts. This enzyme recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5′ termini, resulting in a one-nucleotide shift in substrate specificity. The unique manner in which RppH recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress.

The pore gate of K+ channels is the main site of ion flow and is composed of two gates, one for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. We found that the BK channel lacks an intracellular activation gate and normally shows no C-type inactivation. We also found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. Our findings may help us understand the function of K+ channels and may also provide a new approach for drug development. (Show more)"

The stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. However, the stability of the human pol δ holoenzyme is unknown. We designed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. Surprisingly, the results indicate that human pol δ maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This study provides a unique insight into the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme and its implications for lagging strand synthesis.

In the hypothesized RNA world, before the evolution of genetically encoded proteins, the replication of genetic information was accomplished by RNA polymerases, which were likely ribozymes. In this study, we demonstrate that an RNA polymerase ribozyme can be evolved to synthesize a variety of functional RNA molecules, including aptamers, ribozymes, and even tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins. This work provides a foundation for the study of the origin of life and the evolution of nucleic acids. (Show more)"

We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals, but did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides. These results suggest that ultrafine vellum does not necessarily derive from the use of abortive or newborn animals with ultrathin hides, but could equally well reflect a production process that allowed the skins of maturing animals of several species to be rendered into vellum of equal quality and fineness.

In this study, we show that the squid Euprymna scolopes regulates the activities of its luminescent symbiont, Vibrio fischeri, by the strategic delivery of a single glycan, chitin. Chitin is catabolized by the symbiont only at night, when the squid is active, and this activity is required for the periodic acidification of the crypts, which is essential for the maintenance of the symbiosis. This study provides a new perspective on the role of glycans in the immune system and their potential to regulate the activities of symbiotic microbes. (Show more)"

We introduce a method to identify topics in text data and represent documents as topic sequences. We draw on advances in theoretical machine learning to integrate topic modeling and word embedding, capitalizing on their distinct capabilities. We illustrate our method with a prominent example of underutilized text: the US National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). We identify 225 latent topics in the narratives (e.g., preparation for death and physical aggression); many of these topics are not captured by existing structured variables. We then compare the gender bias of topics to their prevalence in narratives of female versus male victims. Results provide a detailed quantitative picture of reporting about lethal violence and its gendered nature. Our method offers a flexible and broadly applicable approach to model topics in text data. This approach can be applied to many domains, including social media, news, and medical records. It can also be extended to other types of data, such as images and videos."

The identification of AML stem cells is important for the development of more efficient therapies. We show here that monoclonal antibodies targeting the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML.

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

We report the discovery of a small-molecule inhibitor of serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), a key enzyme in one-carbon metabolism. We show that the inhibitor is effective in vitro and in vivo, and that the inhibitor is effective in cancer cell lines, but not in normal cell lines. We also show that one-carbon metabolism is a targetable metabolic deficiency of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a cancer type that is notoriously difficult to treat. Thus, our work identifies a metabolic vulnerability of cancer cells that can be exploited for cancer therapy. This work also provides a platform for the development of a new class of cancer therapeutics. (Read more)"

The disease is caused by a variety of genetic mutations in proteins that are highly aggregation-prone. These proteins form intracellular inclusion bodies that are characteristic of different neuropathological subtypes of the disease. We show that the proteins that form inclusions in ALS are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. Rather, the inclusion bodies in ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. Our results suggest that the inclusion bodies in ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We found that the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop).

Their genome is segmented into eight fragments, which offers evolutionary advantages but complicates genomic packaging. The existence of a selective packaging mechanism, in which one copy of each viral RNA is specifically packaged into each virion, is suspected, but its molecular details remain unknown. Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus. This interaction takes place in infected cells and is required for optimal viral replication. We also show that this interaction favors copackaging of the interacting viral RNA segments. Our results indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions. The lack of conservation of these interactions might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses. (Show more)"

The development of atherosclerotic lesions is a dynamic process that is regulated by a variety of factors, including hemodynamic environment. The objective of this study is to investigate the functional role of Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) in the flow regulation of atheroprone endothelial phenotypes and the consequential development of atherosclerotic lesions. Our results demonstrate a critical role of YAP/TAZ in the disturbed flow-induced atheroprone phenotypes and atherogenesis. Therefore, inhibition of YAP/TAZ activation is a promising athero-protective therapeutic strategy. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the role of YAP/TAZ in the flow regulation of atheroprone phenotypes and atherogenesis, which may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of atherosclerosis. This study also provides a new perspective for the study of the role of YAP/TAZ in the regulation of vascular homeostasis and the development of vascular diseases.

We show that humans have vastly expanded the spatial and seasonal “fire niche” in the United States, accounting for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. Human-caused wildfires disproportionally occurred where fuel moisture was higher than lightning-started fires, thereby helping expand the geographic and seasonal niche of wildfire. Actions to raise awareness and increase management in regions prone to human-started wildfires should be a focus of United States policy to reduce fire risk and associated hazards."

Our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities. Our method can be applied to other cities and other types of imagery, and we hope that it will be useful to urban scholars and practitioners."

Here, we show that the metabolic status of the coral host is a key factor in the breakdown of the symbiosis. We demonstrate that the catabolism of amino acids during heat stress leads to the release of ammonium, which in turn promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. These processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host. Our findings provide a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the largest sauropods had the deepest footprints. Our"
