The virus responsible for this pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is able to evade the antiviral action of interferon (IFN) by blocking nuclear import of STAT1 and STAT2. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 uses a viral accessory protein, Orf6, to block nuclear import of STAT1 and STAT2. We demonstrate that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. However, the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa in herbivore feces. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammal species in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.

The disease is characterized by the accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregates in affected neurons. The cytopathological hallmark of MSA is the accumulation of α-syn aggregates in oligodendrocytes. We show here that the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 is able to limit the accumulation of α-syn in oligodendrocytes and to protect neurons from α-syn toxicity in a mouse model of MSA. These results suggest that VX-765 could be a promising candidate to achieve disease modification in MSA. This would be of great importance as there is no treatment available to slow down the aggressive neurodegenerative process. The results also provide a rationale for the use of VX-765 in other synucleinopathies. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

However, the mechanisms underlying social rank are poorly understood. Here we show that trait anxiety directly influences social dominance in male outbred rats and identify an important mediating role for mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens. High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low-anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as decreased ATP and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals. We conclude that mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens is crucial for social hierarchy establishment and is critically involved in the low social competitiveness associated with high anxiety.

The hemoglobin expression pattern is regulated by a complex network of transcription factors and miRNAs. Here we investigated the role of the insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) in the heterochronic regulation of hemoglobin expression in human erythroid tissues. We show that IGF2BP1 is expressed in human erythroid tissues and that its overexpression causes a nearly complete reversal of the adult hemoglobin expression pattern toward a more fetal-like phenotype.

The most common cause of cancer-related mortality is metastasis, which is driven by the dysregulation of metabolism. In this study, we found that the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) function, highly frequent events in human cancer, confers ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells. This resistance requires sustained activation of mTORC1 and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)C1-dependent induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. Furthermore, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a transcriptional target of SREBP1, mediates the ferroptosis-suppressing activity of SREBP1 by producing monounsaturated fatty acids. Genetic or pharmacologic ablation of SREBP1 or SCD1 sensitized ferroptosis in cancer cells with PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway mutation. Conversely, ectopic expression of SREPB1 or SCD1 restored ferroptosis resistance in these"

The bacterium can be transmitted by multiple transmission pathways, including the bite of infected fleas. In this study, we developed a compartmental model for plague transmission by a human ectoparasite vector. We used Bayesian inference to fit mortality curves from nine outbreaks in Europe. Our results suggest that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by human ectoparasites during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346–1353), challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats. This study provides a better understanding of the history of plague in Europe and may help to prevent future outbreaks. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

It is also the most expensive one, in terms of the number of cells it contains. The evolution of brain size has been extensively studied, but the evolution of brain neurons has been neglected. This study fills this gap by reconstructing the evolution of brain neurons across amniotes. We show that reptiles have not only small brains relative to body size but also low neuronal densities, resulting in average neuron numbers over 20 times lower than those in birds and mammals of similar body size. This has important implications for studies using relative brain size as a proxy when looking for evolutionary drivers of animal cognition. Our results also suggest that the evolution of brain size and neuronal density may be decoupled. This study provides a more complete picture of the evolution of brain size and its underlying mechanisms. It is therefore of great interest to the neuroscience community."

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal cells is not well understood. We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor.

We find that the aquatic lifestyle is driving the evolution of larger body sizes in all four extant aquatic mammal lineages. The aquatic lifestyle is also driving the evolution of a size attractor at ∼500 kg. This size attractor is consistent with energetic constraints on the evolution of body size in the aquatic realm.

This correlates with higher expression levels of type I and type III IFN genes and ISGs at 37 °C. Temperature-dependent IFN induction in response to rhinovirus is dependent on the MAVS protein, a key signaling adaptor of the RIG-I–like receptors (RLRs). Stimulation of mouse airway cells with the synthetic RLR ligand poly I:C leads to greater IFN induction at 37 °C relative to 33 °C at early time points poststimulation and to a sustained increase in the induction of ISGs at 37 °C relative to 33 °C.

It is characterized by the fact that the system is in a critical state, but the rate of change of the system is not constant. In this paper, we report on our discovery of a tropical model with SOC behavior. Our model is continuous, in contrast to all known models of SOC, and is a certain scaling limit of the sandpile model, the first and archetypical model of SOC. We discuss the dichotomy between continuous and discrete models in several contexts. Our aim in this context is to present an idealized tropical toy model, requiring further investigation."

However, the structural basis for antifungal activity of plant immune peptides is not well understood. Here, we report the structure of a unique antifungal peptide from the legume Medicago truncatula. This peptide is highly dynamic and has a unique structure with one α-helix and one β-sheet. The antifungal activity of this peptide is due to its ability to bind to multiple bioactive phosphoinositides in germlings of the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. The antifungal activity of this peptide is also due to its ability to penetrate the fungal cell wall and cell membrane at discrete foci, followed by gradual loss of turgor, subsequent accumulation in the cytoplasm, and elevated levels in nucleoli of germlings. This work provides a structural basis for antifungal activity of plant immune peptides and opens up the possibility of developing this class of peptides as a spray-on fungistat/fungicide.

The activation gate is the molecular switch that opens the channel pore and allows ions to flow through. The inactivation gate is the molecular switch that closes the channel pore and stops ions from flowing. The activation gate is commonly located at the intracellular end of the channel pore, whereas the inactivation gate is commonly located at the selectivity filter. However, the activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We found that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanism of K+ channel activation/deactivation and C-inactivation/recovery. They also provide a foundation for the development of K+ channel modulators. This article is protected by copyright."

In the temperate regions, seasonal influenza outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in ambient humidity. While low humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

This pattern of activity was consistent with a neural implementation of a bottom-up or left-corner parser of the incoming language stream. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases.

The study of ancient plague genomes has revealed the pathogen’s early evolution and ecology, but the number of genomes available to date has been too small to explore its diversity during the critical period of its development. Here, we present 17 Yersinia pestis genomes from the Eurasian Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age (LNBA) period, which spans 5,000 to 2,500 y BP. Our results reveal a nonflea-adapted and potentially extinct single lineage that persisted over millennia without significant parallel diversification, accompanied by rapid dispersal across continents.

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, we found that women’s and men’s endorsement of HM predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. In addition, as conceptualized, HM predicted less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia, but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors. The findings highlight the importance of psychological examinations of masculinity as a cultural ideology to understand how men’s and women’s endorsement of HM legitimizes patriarchal dominance and reinforces gender, race, and class-based hierarchies via candidate support.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how HKU4 and HKU5 transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4.

Breast cancer cells can be classified as either luminal or basal, based on their expression of luminal or basal markers, respectively. Basal breast cancer cells are more aggressive and are associated with poor prognosis. The molecular mechanisms that regulate the differentiation of breast cancer cells are not well understood. We report that hypoxia induces expression of AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), which demethylates N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications on mRNA, and that ALKBH5 expression is required for the maintenance of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), which are responsible for the initiation of breast cancer metastasis. Thus, ALKBH5 may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of breast cancer. This study provides a mechanism for the regulation of BCSC phenotype in response to hypoxia. This study also provides a rationale for the use of ALKBH5 inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of breast cancer.

The first pocket Bibles were made in the 13th century. The source of this parchment, often called “uterine vellum,” has been a long-standing controversy in codicology. We report a simple and objective method to identify the animal origin of parchment. The noninvasive method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals; however, we did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides. These results suggest that ultrafine vellum does not necessarily derive from the use of abortive or newborn animals with ultrathin hides, but could equally well reflect a production process that allowed the skins of maturing animals of several species to be rendered into vellum of equal quality and fineness."

However, recent and predicted future reductions in fire activity may enhance land carbon uptake and corresponding to offsetting ∼5 to 10 y of global CO2 emissions at today’s levels. This potentially reduces warming by up to 0.11 °C by 2100. We show that ignitions and active and passive fire suppression can be as important in driving future fire regimes as changes in climate.

It is also one of the most challenging to model, as it is associated with a large number of changes in the environment and the lifestyle of the organisms. Here, we show that the transition to a parasitic lifestyle, characterized by the parasite’s dependence on a host to fulfill its life cycle, rather than the loss of photosynthesis, is linked to the relaxation of functional constraints on the plastid genome. Our findings suggest that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner. This process is likely to have shaped the molecular evolution of the plastid genome and its molecular architecture, and may have contributed to the success of the photosynthetic lineage.

The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 80% by the year 2100 under high-emission scenarios. These results highlight the strong sensitivity of the drought risk in SSA to future anthropogenic emissions. This work provides a valuable contribution to the ongoing debate on the attribution of the 2015–2017 Cape Town drought.

The formation of the isocyclic fifth ring, the key reaction in the biosynthesis of (bacterio)chlorophylls, has remained enigmatic for more than 60 y. This reaction is catalyzed by two unrelated cyclase enzymes using different chemistries. The majority of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria use BchE, an O2-sensitive [4Fe-4S] cluster protein, whereas plants, cyanobacteria, and some phototrophic bacteria possess an O2-dependent enzyme, the major catalytic component of which is a diiron protein, AcsF. Plant and cyanobacterial mutants in ycf54 display impaired function of the O2-dependent enzyme, accumulating the reaction substrate.

The drought began in 2012 and now includes the lowest calendar-year and 12-mo precipitation, the highest annual temperature, and the most extreme drought indicators on record. The extremely warm and dry conditions have led to acute water shortages, groundwater overdraft, critically low streamflow, and enhanced wildfire risk. We find that precipitation deficits that occurred when conditions were warm were more than twice as likely to yield drought years. We also find that although there has not been a substantial change in the probability of either negative or moderately negative precipitation anomalies in recent decades, the occurrence of drought years has been greater in the past two decades than in the preceding century. Finally, we conclude that anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of co-occurring warm–dry conditions like those that have created the acute human and ecosystem impacts associated with the “exceptional” 2012–2014 drought in California."

The etiology of autism is so complicated because it involves the effects of variants of several hundred risk genes along with the contribution of environmental factors. Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. As an alternative approach, extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying the convergence of the targets and functions of the autism-risk genes to facilitate mapping out causal paths. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that behavioral inflexibility resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the converging functions of autism-risk genes and may facilitate the development of new therapeutic approaches for autism.

We show that aggregates accumulate at synaptic terminals and progressively spread throughout the brain. These aggregates are internalized and accumulate within other neurons. We also show that the release of aggregates requires endocytosis. These results provide a model for the spreading of neurodegenerative disease pathology. This article is protected by copyright.

The disease is associated with the formation of intracellular inclusion bodies that contain a variety of proteins. These inclusions are characteristic of different neuropathological subtypes of the disease. Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions in ALS are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. To explain the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in the brain and spinal cord, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. This study provides a unifying explanation for the neuropathological heterogeneity of ALS. It also provides a rationale for the development of therapeutic strategies that target the metastable proteins that are characteristic of the disease. (Read more)"

The morphology and anatomy of the plant, including aspects of its reproduction, suggest that Montsechia is sister to Ceratophyllum (whenever cladistic analyses are made with or without a backbone). Montsechia was an aquatic angiosperm living and reproducing below the surface of the water, similar to Ceratophyllum. Montsechia is Barremian in age, raising questions about the very early divergence of the Ceratophyllum clade compared with its position as sister to eudicots in many cladistic analyses.

However, the mechanisms by which this is achieved are not well understood. Here, we show that the squid Euprymna scolopes regulates the provision of a single glycan to its symbiotic luminescent bacterium, Vibrio fischeri, in a diel rhythm. This glycan is catabolized by the symbionts, which is required for the maintenance of a healthy symbiosis. This glycan is provided just before dusk, when the squid is preparing to produce light. We propose that this strategy may be used by other hosts to regulate the activities of their associated microbes. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The intervention is simple: teachers are trained to adopt an empathic rather than punitive mindset about discipline. This intervention is scalable because it can be implemented by teachers themselves, with minimal training. It is also sustainable because it can be maintained by teachers themselves. The intervention is also effective: it bolstered the respect students had for their teachers, and reduced suspensions among the most at-risk students."

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis remain unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We found that the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop). The Pro-Gate loop faces toward the minor groove of RNA:DNA hybrid and is involved in modulating the translocation of minor-groove alkylated DNA template after nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion. Taken together, this work provides important mechanistic insights into transcriptional stalling, lesion bypass, and"

To better understand how sequential proteolysis contributes to MERS-CoV infection, we introduced mutations that blocked the first cleavages of MERS-CoV spike (S) proteins. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses trafficked past cell-surface proteases and into endosomes, whereas precleaved viruses used endosomal proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry. Uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant"

This interaction is required for optimal viral replication and favors copackaging of the interacting viral RNA segments. Our experiments indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions. The lack of conservation of these interactions might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses.

Our work highlights the importance of controlling the activity of JNK signaling to maintain epithelial barrier function and host–microbe homeostasis. It also provides a mechanistic understanding of how intestinal tumors can compromise host–microbe interactions and compromise host homeostasis. This work may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies to treat intestinal tumors and restore host–microbe homeostasis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The treatment of breast cancer with chemotherapy may lead to the emergence of cancer stem cells or tumor-initiating cells, which have an enhanced capacity for self-renewal, tumor initiation, and/or metastasis. Here we show that the expression of the type I tyrosine kinaselike orphan receptor ROR1 is up-regulated in breast cancer cells following treatment with chemotherapy. We also show that ROR1 promotes the growth of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we show that the humanized anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab can inhibit the growth of breast cancer patient-derived xenografts in mice. These results suggest that targeting ROR1 may improve the response to chemotherapy of patients with breast cancer. (Read more)"

These changes are consistent with a strong impact on Southern Hemisphere climate, including a shift in the location of the Southern Hemisphere westerlies. The Takahe eruptions plausibly link the start of accelerated deglaciation to the end of the last ice age. This study provides a unique example of how volcanic eruptions can impact climate and is a reminder that volcanic eruptions can have important impacts on our planet.

Fibrous sheath interacting protein 1 (FSIP1) is a cancer antigen expressed in the majority of TNBC tissues and is associated with poor prognosis. However, the role of FSIP1 in the progression and drug sensitivity of TNBC has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. (PsycINFO Database Record"

However, these factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. Our findings have important implications for the design of conservation and restoration strategies.

Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners.

Here we propose a mechanism for memory that is based on the adaptive changes in excitability of neurons. This mechanism is sensitive to context and serial order and can be used to bind linguistic features over time. This work provides a step toward a computational neurobiology of language."

Herein, we report the delivery of siRNA to plants using DNA nanostructures. We show that the size, shape, compactness, stiffness, and attachment location of the DNA nanostructure are the key design parameters for the delivery of siRNA to plants. We also show that the endogenous gene silencing pathway depends on the attachment location of the siRNA. Our work establishes the feasibility of delivering biomolecules to plants with DNA nanostructures and also details the design parameters of importance for plant cell internalization and also assesses the impact of DNA nanostructure geometry for gene silencing mechanisms.

However, decades of monitoring and regulatory efforts have focused on large watersheds, leaving small tributaries largely unmonitored. We used a snapshot of nutrient inputs from nearly all tributaries of Lake Michigan to determine how land cover and dams alter nutrient inputs across watershed sizes. We found that small watersheds are a significant source of coastal nutrient inputs, especially dissolved inorganic nutrients. Our findings suggest that nutrient management efforts should be expanded to address smaller watersheds, as they may play a disproportionate role in fueling algal blooms in nearshore areas. This could have important implications for the management of valuable nearshore ecosystems. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

We find that the long-time dynamics of such systems are biased toward states that exhibit a fine-tuned extremization of environmental forcing. This behavior is reminiscent of the “fine-tuning problem” in cosmology, where the rare combinations of cosmological parameters are required to produce a universe with a small cosmological constant and a small fine-structure constant.

Here we show that NMDAR-Abs change the intrinsic microcircuitry of the cortex, which in turn alters the spectral composition of spontaneous EEG activity. We also show that the same parameter fluctuations in the microcircuitry can be tolerated in a model of the control condition, but that these fluctuations are critical for the development of paroxysmal EEG abnormalities when the microcircuitry is changed by NMDAR-Abs. These findings offer mechanistic insights into circuit-level dysfunction induced by NMDAR-Abs. They also suggest that the same mechanism may be responsible for the diverse range of EEG abnormalities observed in patients with NMDAR-Abs. This may help explain why treatment with immunosuppressants is often required to control the disease. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

We show that RSPO certification reduced deforestation in Indonesia from 2001 to 2015. However, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results suggest that certification is not a silver bullet for the palm oil industry. Rather, it is a tool that can be used to help achieve sustainable production of palm oil."

In humans, its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. The exocyst complex is evolutionarily conserved, and its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. Investigation of the dynamic regulation of the exocyst-related processes using mutants in genetically tractable organisms such as Arabidopsis thaliana is limited by the lethality or the severity of phenotypes. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 (exocyst component of 70 kDa) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and offers a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease.

In vertebrates, sex determination is often a single locus, which results in two sexes. However, in many species, sex determination is polygenic, with multiple alleles segregating within a single species. Here we investigate the effects of polygenic sex determination in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii, where two alleles, one of which determines female sex, and one of which determines male sex, interact to produce four possible sex classes. We find that polygenic sex determination can produce modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics, and that the modularity of secondary sexual characteristics can be increased by the acquisition of a new sex determination allele. These results provide context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations.

We sought to understand how the levels of intracellular iron (Fe) impact the retina. We found that Fe levels in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, which are also challenged by accumulations of vitamin A aldehyde adducts (bisretinoid lipofuscin) that photogenerate reactive oxygen species and photodecompose into damaging aldehyde- and dicarbonyl-bearing species, were reduced in mice treated with the Fe chelator deferiprone. This finding suggests that Fe levels may be a critical factor in the oxidation and degradation of the bisretinoid A2E. These results provide insight into the mechanisms by which Fe levels may impact the retina and may be relevant to the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration.

The origin of these features is poorly understood, however, because of a lack of fossils from the time of their evolution. Here we report the discovery of a hominin hand from 1.42 My old that shows the third metacarpal styloid process, a key derived feature of the human hand, and thus provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of this key shared derived characteristic of modern humans and Neandertals. This finding suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato.

Soil compaction is a major concern, as it reduces soil porosity and increases the risk of soil erosion and loss of soil organic matter. We show that the increase in mechanization has led to higher compaction risk, with the risk of subsoil compaction now affecting 20% of arable land. This alarming trend calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery, considering intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the largest sauropods had fixed foraging trails. Our findings have implications for the design of modern farm machinery and for the management of soil compaction. They also suggest that the ecological strategies of prehistoric animals may have had a major impact on the evolution of modern ecosystems. This article is protected by copyright.
