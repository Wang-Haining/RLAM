We have shown that neon hydrate is a hydrate of the ice II structure, which is a new polymorph of ice. In this work, we have demonstrated that neon atoms can be enclathrated in water molecules to form hydrate. This is a new type of hydrate, which is different from the conventional hydrates of the ice I and ice III structures. The guest atoms can move freely in the channels of the hydrate, which is a unique feature of this hydrate. This work provides a new perspective on the properties of hydrates and their applications. It also provides a new way to store gases, such as neon, in hydrates. This work is expected to be of interest to researchers in the fields of chemistry, materials science, and engineering.

The foundations of quantum theory have been the subject of intense debate for the past century. In this paper, we provide a purely categorical approach to the foundations of quantum theory. Our approach is based on the observation that the category of Hilbert spaces and bounded linear operators is equivalent to the category of continuous linear operators between the categories of probability spaces and Borel measures. This result provides a mathematical foundation for quantum theory that is purely categorical and does not presuppose any analytical structure. Our approach is based on the work of von Neumann, Mackey, Jauch, Piron, Abramsky, and Coecke."

We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

We show that the probability of simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is virtually zero today, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming. This increase in instability is due to a combination of a decrease in mean yields and an increase in the coefficient of variation of yields.

The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. This work provides a proof of concept for the use of computational predictions in the early stages of drug development. It also demonstrates the potential of our design strategy to address the problem of antibiotic resistance. View Full-Text"

The architecture is based on a single set of operations and is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters. The architecture is easy to implement, train, and apply in practice. We show that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters than popular existing architectures, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data. The proposed architecture is expected to be useful in many image-processing problems."

We present a continuous, first-of-its-kind 1.3-My record of continental hydroclimate and lake-level variability derived from drill core data from Lake Malawi, East Africa. We observe dramatic shifts in effective moisture, resulting in large-scale changes in one of the world’s largest lakes and most diverse freshwater ecosystems. The shift in hydroclimate is consistent with a change in climate forcing at the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, and the lake-level variability is consistent with a climate drier than today. The climate variability exerted a profound influence on the Lake Malawi endemic cichlid fish species flock; the geographically extensive habitat reconfiguration provided novel ecological opportunities, enabling new populations to differentiate rapidly to distinct species. Our results provide a unique insight into the influence of climate variability on the evolution of species distributions and the associated ecological processes.

However, the predominant Np4 decapping enzyme in proteobacteria, ApaH, is inactivated by the very conditions of disulfide stress that enable Np4-capped RNAs to accumulate to high levels. Here, we show that, in such cells, the pyrophosphohydrolase RppH, which is not known to decape Np4-capped RNAs, is the predominant enzyme responsible for the deprotection of those transcripts. We also show that, in contrast to its known substrate specificity, RppH recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5′ termini, resulting in a one-nucleotide shift in substrate specificity.

Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in mice lacking the effector caspase 1/11, independent of viral burden.

Our findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection and may help to develop strategies to mitigate the impact of seasonal influenza outbreaks.

We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4.

We connect changes in the physical appearance of five US cities with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

Moreover, we show that Th17 cells can provide “help” for the development of classic Th1 cells.

We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete. These findings suggest that the translation and base-pairing functions compete for the same binding sites on the AzuR RNA. This is an example of a dual-function RNA that has evolved"

In this study, we synthesize the largest global dataset to date of soil respiration, moisture, and temperature measurements, totaling &gt;3,800 observations representing 27 temperature manipulation studies, spanning nine biomes and over 2 decades of warming. Our analysis reveals no significant differences in the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration between control and warmed plots in all biomes, with the exception of deserts and boreal forests. Thus, our data provide limited evidence of acclimation of soil respiration to experimental warming in several major biome types, contrary to the results from multiple single-site studies. Our analysis adds a unique cross-biome perspective on the temperature response of soil respiration, information critical to improving our mechanistic understanding of how soil carbon dynamics change with climatic warming."

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility in autism and may facilitate the development of new therapeutic approaches. This article is protected by copyright.

We found that the presence of alkylation-induced DNA lesions can lead to transcriptional stalling, which is dependent on the proofreading activity of TFIIS. In addition, we found that the presence of alkylation-induced DNA lesions can lead to the error-prone or error-free transcriptional lesion bypass routes. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II, which is involved in modulating the translocation of alkylated DNA template after nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion. Taken together, this work provides important mechanistic insights into transcriptional stalling, lesion bypass, and mutagenesis of alkylated DNA lesions. This article is protected by copyright.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. In this study, we determined the importance of sequential proteolysis in MERS-CoV infection. We found that the first S cleavages, which occur during virus-producing cell secretion, are required for infection into human lung-derived cells, but not into other cell types. These findings suggest that the first cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence."

We find that each oncogene has somewhat different surfaceomes, but the functions of these proteins are harmonized by common biological themes including up-regulation of nutrient transporters, down-regulation of adhesion molecules and tumor suppressing phosphatases, and alteration in immune modulators. These studies provide a broad systems-level view of how specific driver oncogenes remodel the surfaceome and the glycoproteome in a cell autologous fashion, and suggest possible surface targets, and combinations thereof, for drug and biomarker discovery.

This paper provides a comprehensive design-based analysis of the effect of universal vote-by-mail—a policy under which every voter is mailed a ballot in advance of the election—on electoral outcomes. We find that universal vote-by-mail does not appear to affect either party’s share of turnout, does not appear to increase either party’s vote share, and modestly increases overall average turnout rates, in line with previous estimates. All three conclusions support the conventional wisdom of election administration experts and contradict many popular claims in the media. Our findings suggest that vote-by-mail is a policy that can be implemented with little cost and with minimal risk of electoral fraud. They also suggest that the benefits of vote-by-mail may be larger than previously thought."

These results suggest the existence of a gut–brain axis in alcohol dependence, which implicates the gut microbiota as an actor in the gut barrier and in behavioral disorders. Thus, the gut microbiota seems to be a previously unidentified target in the management of alcohol dependence.

This study provides the earliest evidence for the evolution of a key derived feature of the human hand, the third metacarpal styloid process. This fossil provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key derived characteristic of modern human and Neandertal hand morphology and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato. This study also provides a new perspective on the evolution of the human hand in the context of the evolution of the genus Homo."

We have developed a small-molecule inhibitor of both human serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 and 2, and shown that this inhibition blocks the growth of colon cancer xenografts. We have also shown that one-carbon donor formate is a potent rescue of SHMT inhibition in colon cancer cells, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. This latter observation suggests that one-carbon donor rescue may be a useful strategy for the treatment of other cancers, and that the glycine import defect in DLBCL may be a targetable metabolic deficiency of this disease."

This study also shows that increasing access to natural landscapes can improve people’s diets. These findings have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. This study also highlights the importance of considering the role of natural landscapes in meeting nutrition goals, and the need to consider the impact of agricultural intensification on people’s diets. This study also highlights the importance of considering the impact of agricultural intensification on people’s diets."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants."
