The structure of hydrate is also of great importance in the field of materials science, as it is a promising material for high-pressure applications. However, the structure of hydrate at high pressure and low temperature has been a long-standing problem. In this work, we report the structure of hydrate at 480 MPa and 260 K. The structure is found to be the same as that at ambient pressure. This work provides a new insight into the structure of hydrate at high pressure and low temperature. It also provides a new method for studying the structure of hydrate at high pressure and low temperature. The method is expected to be applicable to other hydrates."

Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we report the genomes of two myxozoans, Kudoa iwatai and Myxobolus cerebralis, and compare them to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results show that myxozoans are cnidarians and are a sister taxon to the more complex cnidarian group, the hydrozoa. In addition, we find that myxozoan genomes are among the smallest reported in animals and that they are highly reduced in gene content. These results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This represents a major transition in the evolution of parasites. (Show more)"

We show that SARS-CoV-2 uses a viral accessory protein, Orf6, to block nuclear import of the transcription factors. Our data reveal a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. However, the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammals in semiarid African savanna. We found that the proportion of grass consumption varied widely among species, from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers. Grass consumption was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of grass consumption, indicating that RRA conveys reliable quantitative information about consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption, but dietary composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammal assemblages, and that large mammal diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This study highlights the need for more comprehensive and accurate methods of quantifying diet composition. It also suggests that the coexistence of large herbivores may be more complex than previously thought."

However, the magnitude and the fate of this pollution are still open questions. Using data from the Malaspina 2010 circumnavigation, regional surveys, and previously published reports, we show a worldwide distribution of plastic on the surface of the open ocean, mostly accumulating in the convergence zones of each of the five subtropical gyres with comparable density. However, the global load of plastic on the open ocean surface was estimated to be on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This discrepancy is explained by the size distribution of floating plastic debris, which points at important size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

Our study shows that LCCBs activate Ca2+ signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) through a mechanism that is distinct from that of other Ca2+ channel blockers. Our findings reveal a mechanism of LCCBs action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. This study may lead to the development of new strategies for the treatment of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. (Show more)"

Instead, the policy failed to protect these species because of the continued loss of older forests due to fire and clearcutting elsewhere. The NWFP is a unique case study for evaluating the effectiveness of a policy that is still in effect. Our findings highlight the need to continue to protect older forests and to ensure that the creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the development of older-forest structure."

The development of new antibiotics is a major challenge, and computational approaches are essential tools to this end. We present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. This approach can be extended to other antibiotic classes. This work is expected to contribute to the development of new antibiotics. (Show more)"

The architecture is based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice.

We found that CTLA-4 deletion in adult mice resulted in spontaneous lymphoproliferation, hypergammaglobulinemia, and histologically evident pneumonitis, gastritis, insulitis, and sialadenitis, accompanied by organ-specific autoantibodies. However, in contrast to congenital deficiency, this was not fatal. CTLA-4 deletion induced preferential expansion of CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells. However, T cells from CTLA-4–deficient inducible KO mice were able to adoptively transfer the diseases into T cell-deficient mice. This indicates that CTLA-4 deficiency affects both central and peripheral tolerance and Treg cell-mediated suppression.

In cancer cells, HSP90 is a promising target for therapeutic intervention. However, the utility of HSP90 inhibitors as probes of HSP90 function in normal cells is questionable, because of the presence of HSP90-interacting proteins that are not found in normal cells. Here, we show that TRAP1, a member of the HSP90 family, is found predominantly in mitochondria and that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1 may therefore act as a tumor suppressor. This study provides a rationale for the development of TRAP1-specific inhibitors as probes of TRAP1 function in normal and transformed cells.

The admixture happened recently, and the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, there are geographic influences on the present genomic diversity, independent of the admixture, showing that a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations.

Np4 decapping is critical for the rapid degradation of those RNAs, which is necessary for the cell to adapt to stress. Here, we show that the RNA pyrophosphohydrolase RppH, which is the predominant Np4 decapping enzyme in proteobacteria, is the predominant enzyme responsible for decapping those transcripts in Escherichia coli cells experiencing disulfide stress. Unexpectedly, RppH prefers to decape capped RNAs by attacking the δ-phosphate of the pyrophosphate, rather than the β-phosphate, generating triphosphorylated RNA as the primary product of decapping. This unconventional mechanism for recognizing capped 5′ ends and the differential impact it has on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress.

We show that force application to platelets switches the VWF A1 domain to a second state with faster on-rate, providing a mechanism for activating VWF binding to platelets. This mechanism explains the pathophysiology of VWD mutations. The mechanism also explains the effects of VWD mutations on the binding of VWF to platelets, and the effects of VWD mutations on the bleeding and clotting of patients with VWD."

However, the ACI process is complex and difficult to be well represented in current climate models. The main reason is that the ACI process is difficult to be observed. This study introduces a new technique, the dual-field-of-view high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL), to observe the aerosol and cloud properties simultaneously. The dual-FOV HSRL is used to investigate the interactions between aerosol loading and water cloud microphysical properties. The observations show that the aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI process. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI. This study provides a new way to observe ACI. It is expected to be a significant contribution to the ACI research."

In the temperate regions, seasonal influenza virus outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in ambient humidity. While low ambient humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself.

This could be up to 5.55 million per year by additionally controlling nonfossil anthropogenic sources. Since aerosols mask the anthropogenic rise in global temperature, removing fossil-fuel-generated particles liberates 0.51 °C and all pollution particles 0.73 °C of warming, reaching around 2 °C over North America and Northeast Asia. The steep temperature increase from removing aerosols can be moderated to about 0.36 °C globally by the simultaneous reduction of tropospheric ozone and methane.

Here, we show that the red color of the nectar of the plant Nesocodon mauritianus is derived from a previously undescribed alkaloid. We identify the three enzymatic activities that are necessary for the production of this pigment, and we show that the same enzymatic activities are responsible for the evolution of the red nectar of two other plants, Jaltomata herrerae and Nesocodon. This work provides a better understanding of the evolution of this important plant trait. It also suggests that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation."

Our data indicate that the genetic ancestry of these individuals is mostly consistent with modern northern and central Europeans, but that women exhibit a very high genetic heterogeneity. This heterogeneity includes signals of genetic ancestry ranging from western Europe to East Asia, and includes a group of women with artificial skull deformations. In addition, we found that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago. These results provide insights into the processes that shaped the genetic structure of modern Europeans.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results suggest that MERS-CoV, but not HKU4, has adapted to use human cells for cross-species transmission. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmission.

This pandemic is generally understood as the consequence of a singular introduction of Yersinia pestis, after which the disease established itself in European rodents over four centuries. To locate these putative plague reservoirs, we studied the climate fluctuations that preceded regional plague epidemics, based on a dataset of 7,711 georeferenced historical plague outbreaks and 15 annually resolved tree-ring records from Europe and Asia. We provide evidence for repeated climate-driven reintroductions of the bacterium into European harbors from reservoirs in Asia, with a delay of 15 ± 1 y.

The IL1RAP (IL1R3) is expressed on candidate leukemic stem cells in the majority of AML patients, but not on normal hematopoietic stem cells. We show here that monoclonal antibodies targeting IL1RAP have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This study provides a proof-of-concept for the use of antibodies targeting IL1RAP as a treatment for AML. This"

The admixture happened recently, and the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, there are geographic influences on the present genomic diversity, independent of the admixture, showing that a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations.

We also show that the evolutionary rates and selection pressure coevolve during the transition to parasitism, and that the extent of functional reduction and the establishment of the obligate parasitic lifestyle are linked to bursts of gene losses.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. As an alternative approach, extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying the convergence of the targets and functions of the autism-risk genes to facilitate mapping out causal paths. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility in autism and a potential target for drug development. (Show more)"

However, the mechanisms underlying this process are not fully understood. Here we show that hypoxia induces cerebral edema in rats and neuronal apoptosis in cultured cortical neurons. We also show that this process is mediated by the release of corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) from the hypothalamus, which acts on the cerebral cortex via its receptor CRFR1. This leads to the activation of astrocytes, which in turn release endothelin-1 (ET-1), which in turn causes edema. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying cerebral edema and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for this condition. (Show more)"

However, the minimum number of transcription factors that directly induce vascular ECs remains undefined. Here, we demonstrate that ets variant 2 (ETV2) alone can directly convert primary human adult skin fibroblasts into functional vascular endothelial cells (ETVECs). In coordination with endogenous FOXC2 in fibroblasts, ETV2 induces expression of multiple key endothelial development factors, including FLI1, ERG, and TAL1, and induces expression of endothelial functional molecules, including EGFL7 and von Willebrand factor. Consequently, ETVECs exhibits EC characteristics in vitro and forms mature functional vasculature in Matrigel plugs transplanted in NOD SCID mice. Our study indicates that the creation of ETVECs provides further understanding of human EC development induced by ETV2. This approach may be useful for the treatment of vascular disorders.

Accumulating evidence indicates that stimulator of interferon genes (STING) plays an important role in the regulation of insulin sensitivity. However, its function in β-cells remains unknown. Herein, using global and β-cell–specific knockout mouse models, we revealed a distinct role of STING in the regulation of glucose homeostasis through peripheral tissues and β-cells. Specially, although STING beneficially alleviated insulin resistance and glucose intolerance induced by high-fat diet, it surprisingly impaired islet glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Importantly, STING-βKO caused glucose intolerance due to impaired GSIS, indicating that STING is required for normal β-cell function. Islet transcriptome analysis showed that STING deficiency decreased expression of β-cell function–related genes, contributing to impaired GSIS.

Human-caused wildfires disproportionally occurred where fuel moisture was higher than lightning-caused fires, thereby helping expand the geographic and seasonal niche of wildfire.

However, these factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects of biodiversity loss and environmental warming on ecosystem functioning. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. Our findings have important implications for our ability to predict the impacts of climate change on ecosystem functioning. They also highlight the need to consider the combined effects of biodiversity loss and environmental warming in the management of ecosystems."

This system, termed the “striosome–dendron bouquet,” is formed by striosomal neurons that project to the striatum and are tightly intertwined with dopamine-containing dendrites and clusters of their dopamine-containing parent cell bodies.

We asked pairs of friends and strangers to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

We also show that the evolution of specialized predators is not a dead end, and that they can evolve into generalists. These findings help us understand the evolution of predatory specialization and its impact on food webs."

The study of the hominin hand is complicated by the paucity of fossils in the hominin fossil record between 800,000 and 1.8 My old, a time interval well documented for the emergence and subsequent proliferation of Acheulian technology. We report the discovery of a hominin hand fossil from East Africa that preserves the third metacarpal styloid process, a key derived feature of the human hand that is absent in early hominins. This fossil provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of this key derived feature of the human hand and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato. This study also highlights the importance of the study of fossil hands in understanding the evolution of the human hand. (Show more)"

Here we identify a metabolic vulnerability of cancer cells, and develop a strategy to exploit it. We identify a small-molecule inhibitor of the one-carbon metabolism enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase, and show that it is effective in cancer cells. We also show that cancer cells have unique metabolic vulnerabilities, and that these can be exploited to develop more effective cancer therapies. This work provides a strategy for the development of more effective cancer therapies. (Show more)"

This study shows that deforestation can reduce people’s consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are important sources of vitamin A. Conversely, forest fragmentation can increase consumption of fruits and vegetables, which is important for vitamin A adequacy. These findings have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. This study also highlights the importance of using a causal modeling approach to understand the impact of deforestation on people’s diets. This approach can be used to identify the causal effects of deforestation on people’s diets, which is not possible using traditional descriptive approaches.

We show that the weight of modern farm machinery has increased by a factor of 10 since the 1950s, and that this trend has led to a significant increase in subsoil compaction. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the discovery of a 130-million-year-old footprint"
