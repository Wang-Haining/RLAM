In this work, we report the synthesis of a hydrate, neon hydrate, which is isostructural with ice II. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The resolved structure where Ne dissolved in ice II is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. The density distributions indicate that the vibration of Ne atoms is mainly in planes perpendicular to D2O channels, whereas their distributions along the channels are further constrained by interactions between adjacent Ne atoms. Our work provides a new route to study the structure of ice II and opens up a new avenue for the study of hydrates at high pressure. This work also provides a new material for the study of the structure of ice II and the properties of hydrates at high pressure. (Show more)"

In this paper, we provide a purely categorical approach to the foundations of quantum theory. The axioms are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. This addresses a question about the mathematical foundations of quantum theory raised in reconstruction programs such as those of von Neumann, Mackey, Jauch, Piron, Abramsky, and Coecke. Our approach is based on the notion of a Hilbert category, which is a generalization of a category that generalizes the notion of a Hilbert space. We show that the category of Hilbert spaces is equivalent to the category of continuous linear functions between Hilbert spaces. This result is a step toward a reconstruction of quantum theory in terms of a suitable category of Hilbert categories."

Although the evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we present the first comparative genomic analysis of two distantly related myxozoan species and a cnidarian parasite. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. These results provide insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the IFN antagonism mechanism used by SARS-CoV-2 and may lead to the development of new strategies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of the Hv1 channel. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

We quantify the magnitude of this increase in the major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. We find that the variability of maize yields will increase substantially, and that the probability of simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year will increase dramatically. These results highlight the need for increased investments in breeding for heat tolerance. They also underscore the urgency of these investments, as the 800 million people living in extreme poverty are most vulnerable to food price spikes. Our results show that the instability in global grain trade and international grain prices will become more pronounced as the Earth warms. This instability will affect especially the poorest countries, which are also the most vulnerable to food price spikes."

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because species-level identification of food plants is prohibitively difficult with traditional methods. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species of large herbivores in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results highlight the need for more comprehensive methods to identify food plants in future studies of LMH diet partitioning. This will be critical to understanding the role of LMH in the maintenance of biodiversity in African savanna. (Less)"

However, the global load of plastic debris on the open ocean surface is still unknown. We show that the global load of plastic debris on the open ocean surface is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This discrepancy is explained by the selective removal of small plastic fragments by the ocean interior. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean.

Despite advances in treatment, many patients do not respond to current therapies. In this study, we identified a mechanism of cancer resistance to ferroptosis, a form of regulated necrosis driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. We found that the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis protects cancer cells from ferroptosis through the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and its target stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1). We also found that SREBP1 and SCD1 are frequently mutated in cancer, and that inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis induction. These findings suggest that combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction may be a promising strategy for cancer therapy. (Show more)"

This problem can be addressed by the development of new antibacterial agents to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. Here, we present a rational design approach to identify new antibiotics.

We tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. The approach described here is a promising strategy for the discovery of new antibiotics. It can be easily extended to other drug classes and can be used in combination with other computational and experimental approaches.

Here, we present a mathematical model for plague transmission by human ectoparasites and show that this model fits mortality curves from nine outbreaks better than models for rodent transmission. Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346–1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats. This work contributes to a better understanding of the history of plague and its vectors. It also provides a framework for studying the spread of plague in the future."

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal and transformed cells is more complex than previously appreciated. We have shown that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This study also highlights the need for more specific TRAP1 inhibitors. (TRAP1-specific inhibitors are not currently available.) Our results suggest that TRAP1 may be a promising target for the treatment of certain cancers. (TRAP1-specific inhibitors are not"

However, the mechanism by which ADF/cofilin severes filaments is unknown. Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques, coupled to microfluidics, to study the action of ADF/cofilin in different mechanical situations. We find that ADF/cofilin binds to filaments and that filament curvature favors severing. Surprisingly, tension has no effect on ADF/cofilin binding, but it weakly enhances severing. We also find that ADF/cofilin-induced filament twist enhances severing. A simple model, which faithfully recapitulates our experimental observations, indicates that the ADF/cofilin-induced twist increases the severing rate constant 100-fold. We propose that this mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for how ADF/cofilin, which is involved in severing, is able to sever highly connected filament networks.

To understand the mechanism of temperature-dependent growth, we compared the transcriptional response of primary mouse airway epithelial cells infected with rhinovirus at 33 °C vs. 37 °C. We found that mouse airway cells infected with mouse-adapted rhinovirus exhibited a striking enrichment in expression of antiviral defense response genes at 37 °C relative to 33 °C. This correlated with significantly higher expression levels of type I and type III IFN genes and ISGs at 37 °C. Temperature-dependent IFN induction in response to rhinovirus was dependent on the MAVS protein, a key signaling adaptor of the RIG-I–like receptors (RLRs). Stimulation of primary airway cells with the synthetic RLR ligand poly I:C led to greater IFN induction at 37 °C relative to 33 °C at early time points poststimulation and to a sustained increase in the induction of ISGs at 37 °C relative to 33 °C.

These findings demonstrate that P. aeruginosa uses type IV pili for both twitching motility and as a sensor regulating surface-induced gene expression and pathogenicity. This is the first report of a bacterial mechanosensitive system that detects the mechanical activity of a surface-associated protein.

However, the antifungal activity of peptides has been limited. Here, we report the antifungal activity of a structurally unique NCR peptide, which is a member of a large family of nodule-specific peptides in the model legume Medicago truncatula. The antifungal activity of the peptide was attributed to its ability to bind to the fungal cell wall and disrupt the cell membrane. The peptide also induced reactive oxygen species and compromised the integrity of the cell membrane. The peptide was effective against multiple plant fungal pathogens and could be applied as a spray-on fungistat/fungicide. This work provides a foundation for the development of this class of peptides as a new class of antifungal agents. (Show more)"

This instrument is capable of providing high-resolution and simultaneous observations of aerosols and clouds, especially water cloud microphysical properties. We use this instrument to conduct a case study over Beijing, China, to investigate the interactions between aerosol loading and water cloud microphysical properties. The results show that the aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation.

We isolate the changes in the cytoskeleton and membrane and show that reduction in the bending modulus is directly correlated with parasite invasion efficiency. These data suggest that the malaria parasite primes the erythrocyte surface through its binding antigens, altering the biophysical nature of the target cell and thus reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion. This finding would constitute a major change in our concept of malaria parasite invasion, suggesting it is, in fact, a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces working together to facilitate entry.

In the temperate regions, seasonal influenza outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in ambient humidity. While low ambient humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition.

These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. HM was associated with less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia, but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4.

We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML.

However, the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms of ASK1 in neuroinflammation remain unknown. In this study, we found that ASK1 in microglia/macrophages plays a major role in generating and maintaining disease, whereas ASK1 in astrocytes plays a greater proinflammatory role in the later stage of EAE.

It is difficult to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. We used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. Our study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility in autism and suggests that the forgetting process is a common target for autism-risk genes.

Here, we identified and characterized a protein that is highly concentrated in the submandibular salivary gland of bats.

These mutations are linked to the formation of intracellular inclusion bodies that contain a variety of proteins that do not share obvious characteristics other than coaggregation. Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions in ALS are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. To explain the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in the brain and spinal cord, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

To better understand the mechanisms of MERS-CoV infection, we engineered MERS viruses with mutations that blocked sequential proteolysis. These mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses trafficked past cell-surface proteases and into endosomes, whereas precleaved viruses used endosomal proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence. This study provides insights into the mechanisms of virus–cell membrane fusion and may help to explain the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV. (EMBO Mol"

However, STING deficiency in β-cells impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, suggesting a possible role of STING in β-cell dysfunction. Indeed, STING deficiency decreased expression of β-cell function–related genes, contributing to impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Moreover, STING deficiency in β-cells decreased nuclear localization of Pax6, a transcription factor that might be associated with defective glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.

Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus. We show that this interaction takes place in infected cells and is required for optimal viral replication. Disruption of this interaction decreases the amount of viral RNA in the viral particles, resulting in an eightfold increase in empty viral particles. Our experiments indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions.

Here, we show that the metabolic interactions between coral and symbiont are a key factor in the breakdown of the symbiosis. We demonstrate that the catabolism of amino acids during heat stress increases the energy demand of the coral host, which is compensated by the degradation of amino acids. The resulting shift from net uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont subsequently promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host.

The SAN is composed of specialized cardiomyocytes, which are responsible for generating the heart rate. SAN cells (SANCs) are able to adjust heart rate to meet hemodynamic demand by integrating the membrane and store clocks. Here, we report that stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is a key regulator of the membrane clock in SANCs. Cardiac-specific deletion of STIM1 in mice resulted in depletion of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ stores of SANCs and led to SAN dysfunction, as was evident by a reduction in heart rate, sinus arrest, and an exaggerated autonomic response to cholinergic signaling. Moreover, STIM1 influenced SAN function by regulating ionic fluxes in SANCs, including activation of a store-operated Ca2+ current, a reduction in L-type Ca2+ current, and enhancing the activities of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. These studies reveal that STIM1 is a multifunctional regulator of Ca2+ dynamics in SANCs that links SR Ca2+ store content with electrical events occurring in the plasma membrane, thereby contributing to automat"

Certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results suggest that certification is a promising tool for reducing deforestation, but it is not a silver bullet. Rather, certification must be part of a broader strategy to reduce deforestation."

It is conserved across kingdoms, and its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases. The exocyst complex is difficult to study in humans because of its complexity and the severity of the disease. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

In vertebrates, sex is determined by a single locus, resulting in two sexes, or by multiple interacting loci, resulting in more than two sexes. Here we investigate the effects of multiple interacting sex determination loci in a species with four possible sex classes. We find that multiple loci can produce modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics, and that the modularity of secondary sexual characteristics can be increased by the acquisition of a new sex determination locus. These results provide context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of the maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations. (Show more)"

We show that the accumulation of the oxidized retinal compound A2E in the retina is reduced in mice treated with a Fe chelator. This reduction is due to a reduction in the oxidation of A2E by reactive oxygen species and Fenton chemistry products. These findings have implications for the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in the elderly. (Read more)"

However, the evolution of specialization is often considered a dead end, as it is associated with the evolution of morphological and functional optimizations throughout the organism. Here we show that the evolution of specialization in siphonophores, a group of pelagic cnidarians, is associated with the evolution of modularity in their feeding apparatus. Our findings contribute to a broader perspective on the evolution of predatory specialization, and help understand how morphological innovations have shaped present-day food webs. This work contributes to the development of a more complete understanding of the evolution of predators and their role in ecosystems."

The discovery of a hominin hand from 1.42 My ago provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key derived characteristic of modern human and Neandertal hand morphology. This finding suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato. This discovery also highlights the importance of the Turkana Basin in the study of human evolution. The basin has produced a large number of hominin fossils, including the earliest known evidence for modern human behavior. The basin is also the site of the most recent discovery of a Neandertal fossil. The basin is thus a unique place to study the evolution of the human hand. (Less)"

We have identified a small-molecule inhibitor of serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), a key enzyme in one-carbon metabolism. We show that this inhibitor is effective in vitro and in vivo, and that it is particularly effective in B-cell lines. We also show that one-carbon metabolism is a targetable metabolic deficiency of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Thus, we have identified a metabolic pathway that can be targeted to kill cancer cells, and a metabolic deficiency that can be targeted to kill lymphoma cells. These findings have implications for the development of new cancer therapies. (truncated)"

This study shows that deforestation can reduce people’s consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are important sources of vitamins, particularly vitamin A. Conversely, forest fragmentation can increase consumption of fruits and vegetables, which is important for meeting dietary vitamin A adequacy. These findings have important implications for policy makers, who should consider the role of natural landscapes in meeting nutrition goals, particularly in rural areas of low- and middle-income countries."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We hypothesize that this trend is a consequence of the increasing size of modern farm vehicles, which are now approaching the weight of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods."
