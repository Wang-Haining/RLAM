The evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, but a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we present the first comparative genomic analysis of two distantly related myxozoan species and a cnidarian parasite. Our results show that the myxozoan body plan is reduced to the essential elements for survival as parasites. Our findings suggest that the transition from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Read more)"

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to hijack the nuclear pore complex to block the nuclear import of transcription factors. Our results uncover a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the nuclear pore complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the antiviral action of the immune system and may lead to the development of new antiviral strategies.

Zinc is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. Sperm cells are quiescent in the male reproductive system due to Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels, but become active once introduced into the low-Zn2+-concentration environment of the female reproductive tract. How Zn2+ inhibits proton channels is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some proton channel residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each proton channel subunit. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

We found that mutation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis, highly frequent in cancer, confers ferroptosis resistance, and that this resistance is mediated by sustained activation of mTORC1 and the transcriptional activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central regulator of lipid metabolism. Conversely, ectopic expression of SREBP1 sensitized cancer cells to ferroptosis.

Computational approaches are essential tools to this end since their application enables fast and early strategical decisions in the drug development process. Here, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. This work is a proof of concept that computational design of antibiotics can be a powerful tool for the development of new drugs. This approach can be extended to other antibiotic classes and to other targets. This will be of great importance in the fight against antibiotic resistance. This article is protected by copyright.

We used a grid-based approach to sample the genomic diversity across the island, from the north to the south, from the east to the west. We found that the Malagasy population is a mixture of Bantu and Austronesian people, with a limited contribution from Europe and the Middle East. The settlement history of Madagascar is complex, with a recent arrival of Malagasy people, but the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the settlement was not homogeneous. In addition, we found that a few centuries are sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. This study provides a comprehensive view of the genomic diversity of Madagascar, which will be useful for the study of human evolution and the settlement history of Madagascar.

Observations of ACI are challenging because of the difficulty in simultaneously measuring aerosols and clouds. Here, we introduce a new instrument, the dual-field-of-view high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL), which can measure aerosols and clouds simultaneously. We use this instrument to investigate the interactions between aerosol loading and water cloud microphysical properties. The observations show that increased aerosol loading led to increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius, which is consistent with expectations. However, the aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI.

In temperate regions, seasonal outbreaks of influenza virus correlate with decreases in ambient humidity. However, the impact of humidity on host defense against influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We also show that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

We connect changes in the physical appearance of five US cities with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities. This work also provides a proof of concept for a new type of urban monitoring that can be used to study the physical dynamics of cities."

CSCs are characterized by their ability to self-renew and to give rise to differentiated cells, and are thought to be responsible for the metastatic potential of tumors. In this study, we show that hypoxia induces expression of ALKBH5, an m6A demethylase, which in turn increases the expression of NANOG, a gene that encodes a pluripotency factor. NANOG is methylated at an m6A residue in the 3′-UTR, and this methylation is reduced in the presence of hypoxia.

The identification of AML stem cells is important for the development of more efficient therapies. Here, we show that monoclonal antibodies targeting the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects, and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. We also generated an antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The RNA encodes a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC) that increases the activity of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a key enzyme in the metabolism of glycerol. We found that the protein interacts with the enzyme and that the RNA encoding the protein interferes with the RNA’s ability to repress the expression of genes involved in carbon utilization. These results demonstrate that the translation product of the RNA can compete with the RNA for its target mRNA. This is an example of a mechanism that can be used to control the expression of genes in bacteria. This mechanism may be important in the regulation of carbon utilization in bacteria."

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus. Using this interaction, we demonstrated that the viral genome is packaged into virions in a sequence-dependent manner.

The virus has been shown to replicate in human cells, but the time course of infection and the rate of viral production are unknown. Here we present a mathematical analysis of the within-host dynamics of ZIKV in a nonhuman primate model, allowing for characterization of the growth and clearance of ZIKV within individual macaques. We show that the rate of viral production is rapid and that the time between cell infection and viral production is short. We also show that the antiviral treatment favipiravir can reduce the time to undetectable plasma viral load by ∼2 d. However, the treatment is most effective when given prophylactically starting at the time of infection. These results can be used to guide the design of future clinical trials.

We also show that inhibiting JNK signaling or depleting the microbiome restores barrier function, leading to a reestablishment of host–microbe homeostasis, and organismal lifespan extension. Our results identify a JNK-dependent feedback amplification loop between intestinal tumors and the microbiome, and they highlight the importance of controlling the activity level of JNK signaling to maintain epithelial barrier function and host–microbe homeostasis.

Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners.

Here, we show that Si pretreatment of rice plants increases resistance against the rice leaffolder, a major insect pest of rice, and that this effect is mediated by the jasmonate (JA) signaling pathway. Our results suggest that Si and JA act synergistically in rice defense against insect herbivores. This study provides insights into the role of Si in plant defense and may lead to the development of Si-based pest management strategies for rice. This article is protected by copyright.

The dominant view is that this is achieved through sustained, elevated neural activity. Here we propose an alternative view, where information is maintained through adaptive changes in neuronal excitability. We show that this mechanism can support memory on timescales ranging from milliseconds to seconds. We demonstrate that this mechanism is sensitive to context and serial order which makes it suitable for temporal integration in sequence processing within the language domain. This work provides a step toward a computational neurobiology of language."

This is due to the cell wall, which is absent in mammalian cells and poses the dominant physical barrier to biomolecule delivery in plants. Here, we report the delivery of siRNA to plants using DNA nanostructures. We show that the size, shape, compactness, stiffness, and attachment location of the DNA nanostructure are important design parameters for the delivery of siRNA to plant cells. We also show that the delivery of siRNA to plant cells correlates with the delivery of the corresponding gene silencing, but that the endogenous gene silencing pathway depends on the attachment location of the siRNA. Our work establishes the feasibility of DNA nanostructures for the delivery of biomolecules to plants and also details the design parameters of importance for gene silencing mechanisms.

In the United States, the majority of nutrient pollution comes from small tributaries that drain surrounding watersheds. However, decades of monitoring and regulatory efforts have focused on large water bodies, ignoring the importance of small tributaries. We show that small tributaries can be a significant source of nutrients to large water bodies, and that their nutrient loads are often high for their size. Our findings suggest that small tributaries may be a significant contributor of coastal eutrophication, and that nutrient management efforts should be expanded to include small tributaries. This could help protect valuable nearshore ecosystems and the services they provide to society."

In humans, its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. Investigation of the dynamic regulation of the evolutionarily conserved exocyst-related processes using mutants in genetically tractable organisms such as Arabidopsis thaliana is limited by the lethality or the severity of phenotypes. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 (exocyst component of 70 kDa) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study not only provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation but also offers a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease.

In this study, we investigate the effects of multiple interacting sex determination alleles on secondary sexual characteristics in a fish species with four possible sex classes. We find that the modularity of secondary sexual characteristics produced by multiple sex determination alleles can be used to understand the evolutionary causes and consequences of sex determination alleles in populations. Our results suggest that the modularity of secondary sexual characteristics may be a general consequence of multiple sex determination alleles, and may be a key factor in the maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations."

One of these factors is the accumulation of vitamin A aldehyde adducts (bisretinoids) that photogenerate reactive oxygen species and photodecompose into damaging aldehyde- and dicarbonyl-bearing species. We show that the Fe chelator deferiprone (DFP) reduces the accumulation of bisretinoids in the retina of albino mice. This effect is associated with a reduction in the photodegradation of the bisretinoid A2E. These findings suggest that Fe plays a role in the photodegradation of bisretinoids and that DFP may be useful in the treatment of retinal diseases. This article is protected by copyright.

We show that this is not the case in siphonophores, a group of pelagic colonial cnidarians. We show that siphonophore specialists can evolve into generalists, and that specialists on one prey type have evolved into specialists on other prey types. Our findings help us understand how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs."

Here we report the discovery of a series of small-molecule dual inhibitors of SHMT1 and SHMT2, and show that these compounds are effective in cancer cells. However, one-carbon donor formate is required for cellular SHMT inhibition, and this is particularly important in cancer cells that are deficient in glycine import.

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction."
