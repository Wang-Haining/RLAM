In particular, there is no consensus on the precise nature of the mathematical objects that quantum theory deals with. This paper provides a categorical characterization of the category of observables in terms of a set of purely categorical axioms. The axioms are shown to be sufficient to characterize the category of observables, and they are shown to be necessary if one assumes the existence of a basis for states. The characterization is purely categorical and does not presuppose any analytical structure. The characterization is shown to be consistent with the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics. The characterization is shown to be consistent with the operational interpretation of quantum mechanics."

The evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, but a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we present the first genomic and transcriptomic assemblies for two species of myxozoans, which represent the most distant species pairs in the group. We show that myxozoans are cnidarians and are a sister group to the less reduced cnidarian parasite, P. hydriforme. We also show that myxozoans are one of the most reduced animal groups, with a small genome and gene content. These results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content.

Zinc is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is largely unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level differences in diet. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammalian herbivores in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species, even among species matched in body size and digestive physiology. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption, but dietary composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammalian herbivore assemblages. Our findings highlight the importance of diet composition in determining trophic interactions, and the need to consider the taxonomic resolution of diet data when investigating the coexistence of species."

We show that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data, and is able to achieve state-of-the-art results on several segmentation problems. The proposed architecture is also easier to implement, train, and apply in practice."

Here we present a continuous, first-of-its-kind 1.3-My record of continental hydroclimate and lake-level variability derived from drill core data from Lake Malawi, East Africa. We observe dramatic shifts in effective moisture, resulting in large-scale changes in one of the world’s largest lakes and most diverse freshwater ecosystems. The shift in hydroclimate at the Mid-Pleistocene Transition is consistent with far-field climate forcing, which separates vastly different hydroclimate regimes before and after 800,000 years ago. The record provides a unique window into the past climate of the tropics, and the influence of orbital forcing on the evolution of the Lake Malawi endemic cichlid fish species flock. The record also demonstrates the ability of the lake to respond rapidly to changes in climate. View Full-Text"

These social-learning conditions were compared with an asocial individual-learning condition in which individual participants made repeated attempts at constructing a paper plane, without having access to any planes produced by other participants. Larger populations generated greater variation in plane performance and gave participants access to better-adapted planes, but this did not enhance CCE.

In this paper, we provide a new insight into the formation of the inner core by showing that the bcc phase of iron is more likely to nucleate than the hcp phase. This mechanism reduces the required undercooling of iron nucleation, which provides a key factor in solving the inner core nucleation paradox. The two-step nucleation scenario of the inner core also opens an avenue for understanding the structure and anisotropy of the present inner core. View Full-Text"

The study of ancient plague genomes provides a unique window into the early evolution of this devastating disease. Here, we present 17 plague genomes from a wide geographic expanse across Eurasia, spanning the Late Neolithic to the Bronze Age. Our results reveal a nonflea-adapted and potentially extinct lineage that persisted over millennia without significant parallel diversification, accompanied by rapid dispersal across continents. We also discover the presence of the flea-adapted form of plague in Bronze Age Iberia, previously only identified in the Caucasus and the Volga regions, suggesting a much wider geographic spread of this form of plague.

Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The RNA encodes a 28-amino acid protein that increases the activity of aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. We also show that the RNA also encodes a protein that interferes with the ability of the RNA to repress carbon utilization genes. This demonstrates that the translation and base-pairing functions of the RNA compete with each other. This is an example of a mechanism that has evolved to regulate the activity of an sRNA. This mechanism is likely to be common in bacteria, and may be important in the regulation of carbon metabolism in bacteria."

Therefore, it is difficult to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. Our results show that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility, which resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. These results provide a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral phenotypes of autism-risk genes and suggest a potential target for the treatment of autism. (PsycINFO Database Record"

This mechanism is sequence dependent and involves interactions between the viral RNA segments that are not widely conserved among influenza A viruses. This mechanism might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses. Our results provide a better understanding of the packaging mechanism of influenza A viruses.

We connect changes in the physical appearance of five US cities with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities."

Here, we show that the metabolic interactions between the coral host and its algal symbionts play a crucial role in the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis. We demonstrate that the catabolism of amino acids during heat stress promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates, which in turn leads to the degradation of the coral–algal symbiosis. This process is driven by altered nutrient cycling, which is a consequence of the host’s energy limitation. Our results provide a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general."

However, the function of Si in plant defense against insect herbivores has not been well characterized. In this study, we show that Si pretreatment of rice plants increases resistance against the rice leaffolder, and that this effect is dependent on the jasmonate (JA) signaling pathway. Our results suggest that Si may promote the accumulation of JA in rice, which in turn enhances resistance against insect herbivores. These findings provide insights into the potential of Si as a biocontrol agent for insect pests. (Less)"
