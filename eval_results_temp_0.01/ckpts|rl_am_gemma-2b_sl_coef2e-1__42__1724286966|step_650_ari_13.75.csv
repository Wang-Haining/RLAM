The evolutionary origin of this group has been elusive, and a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species and a cnidarian parasite. Our results show that the myxozoan body plan is reduced to the essential elements required for parasitism. This reduction is accompanied by a dramatic decrease in genome size and gene content. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by a reduction in genome size and gene content. This is the first time to our knowledge that a comparative analysis of the genomes of three distantly related species has been performed. This approach allowed us to identify candidate genes that are essential for the parasitic lifestyle. (Read more)"

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to block nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that mediate the antiviral response induced by IFN. We found that the viral accessory protein Orf6 is responsible for this activity. We also show that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1, a protein complex that mediates nuclear import of cargo proteins. We further demonstrate that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its ability to antagonize the IFN response. Our findings unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. These results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to antagonize the host IFN response and may help in the development of new strategies to combat COVID-19.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1.

We find that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields will increase to values much larger than present-day values in most of the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields. The probability that the top four maize-exporting countries have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because species-level identification of plant foods is prohibitively difficult with traditional methods. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammal species in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results highlight the importance of diet composition in determining the extent to which species partition food resources. These results have implications for understanding the role of LMH in African savanna ecosystems and for the conservation of these keystone species. This article is protected by copyright.

This discrepancy is explained by the selective removal of small plastic fragments by the ocean interior. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean.

The effective CPUE of most countries in 2015 was a fifth of its 1950s value, which was compared with a global decline in abundance. There are signs, however, of stabilization and more effective management in recent years, with a reduction in fleet sizes in developed countries. The global fleet could increase by 1 million motorized vessels by midcentury as developing countries continue to transition away from subsistence fisheries. This would challenge sustainable use of fisheries' resources. The expansion of the motorized fleet has been driven by the powered-artisanal fleet, which has grown substantially in recent decades.

A Threonine to Alanine substitution at this position was studied in three representative members of the K+-channel family. Interestingly, all of the mutant channels exhibited lack of C-type inactivation gating and an inversion of their allosteric coupling (i.e., closing of the activation gate collapses the channel’s selectivity filter).

The Hb system is also a major target of the let-7 miRNA pathway. Here we show that the insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) is a downstream element of the let-7 miRNA pathway in erythroid cells. IGF2BP1 is developmentally downregulated in adult bone marrow and upregulated in fetal liver. IGF2BP1 overexpression in erythroid cells causes a nearly complete reversal of the adult Hb expression pattern toward a more fetal-like pattern. This reversal is mediated by reduced protein expression of the transcription factor BCL11A. These results suggest a mechanism for chronoregulation of Hb expression in humans.

In this study, we found that the activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis protects cancer cells from ferroptosis, a form of regulated necrosis driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. This resistance is mediated by sustained activation of mTORC1 and the transcriptional induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central regulator of lipid metabolism. In contrast, mTORC1 inhibition sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis, and this sensitivity is associated with the suppression of SREBP1. In addition, we found that the combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction results in near-complete tumor regression in preclinical models. These findings suggest that mTORC1 inhibition may be a promising strategy for cancer treatment in combination with ferroptosis-inducing agents. (Read more)"

The major drug class for treating hypertension is L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs). LCCBs are associated with heart failure in patients. Here, we show that LCCBs activate Ca2+ signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) through a mechanism that involves depletion of ER Ca2+. This depletion causes STIM to relocalize to junctions and activate ORAI. LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. Our findings unravel a mechanism of LCCBs action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. This mechanism may explain the association of LCCBs with heart failure in patients. Our data may help to develop new strategies for treating hypertension and heart failure.

The NWFP also failed to reverse declines of early-seral–associated bird populations on federal land, where early-seral ecosystems were created. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure.

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal cells is not well understood. We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor.

This enzyme, which is involved in the degradation of RNA, prefers Np4-capped RNAs as substrates over their tri- and diphosphorylated counterparts. The unique manner in which capped substrates of this kind bind to the active site of the enzyme positions the δ-phosphate, rather than the β-phosphate, for hydrolytic attack, generating triphosphorylated RNA as the primary product of decapping. Consequently, a second deprotection step is required to produce the monophosphorylated 5′ terminus needed to stimulate rapid RNA degradation.

However, a global, quantitative view of how the biomass of different taxa compare with one another is still lacking. Here, we assemble the overall biomass composition of the biosphere, establishing a census of the ≈550 Gt C of biomass distributed among all of the kingdoms of life. We find that the kingdoms of life concentrate at different locations on the planet; plants (≈450 Gt C) are primarily terrestrial, whereas animals (≈2 Gt C) are mainly marine, and bacteria (≈70 Gt C) and archaea (≈7 Gt C) are predominantly located in deep subsurface environments. We show that the global marine biomass pyramid contains more consumers than producers, thus increasing the scope of previous observations on inverse food pyramids. Finally, we highlight that the mass of humans is an order of magnitude higher than that of all wild mammals combined and report the historical impact of humanity on the global biomass of prominent taxa, including mammals, fish, and plants.

The peptide is a potent fungicide against multiple plant fungal pathogens, including Botrytis cinerea and three Fusarium spp. It binds to multiple bioactive phosphoinositides in vitro and induces reactive oxygen species in germlings of the fungal pathogen B. cinerea. The peptide also exhibits strong cell wall binding and penetration of the cell membrane at discrete foci, followed by gradual loss of turgor, subsequent accumulation in the cytoplasm, and elevated levels in nucleoli of germlings. The peptide is effective in spray applications against gray mold disease in tomato and tobacco plants.

The A1 domain in VWF binds to platelet glycoprotein Ibα (GPIbα), but the mechanism of this interaction is not understood. We show that force application switches VWF A1 and GPIbα to a second state with faster on-rate, providing a mechanism for activating VWF binding to platelets. This mechanism explains the effects of mutations in VWD. The mechanism also suggests that VWF A1 and GPIbα are in a conformational equilibrium. This equilibrium is perturbed by force, which may be a mechanism for regulating VWF function. The mechanism may also be relevant to other proteins that bind to receptors on the cell surface.

The HSRL is capable of measuring aerosol and cloud properties with high spatial and temporal resolution. We demonstrate the capability of the HSRL to investigate ACI processes. The observations show that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation.

We induced C-type inactivation in BK channels and studied the relationship between activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery.

While low humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low humidity makes them more susceptible to severe disease following influenza virus challenge. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

In this study, we show that zebrafish ALK/LTK and human ALK are able to activate zebrafish LTK and human ALK in vitro. We further show that zebrafish ALK/LTK and human ALK are able to regulate zebrafish iridophore development in vivo. Our results provide in vivo evidence of (i) activation of ALK/LTK family receptors by ALKALs and (ii) an involvement of these ligand–receptor complexes in neural crest development. These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of ALK/LTK family receptor activation and regulation in vivo.

Our results suggest a nonflea-adapted and potentially extinct single lineage that persisted over millennia without significant parallel diversification, accompanied by rapid dispersal across continents. We also discover the presence of the flea-adapted form of plague in Bronze Age Iberia, previously only identified in the Caucasus and the Volga regions, suggesting a much wider geographic spread of this form of plague.

Here, we show that the red color of Nesocodon’s nectar is derived from a previously undescribed alkaloid. We also identify a mechanism for the production of this pigment in other plants. This work suggests that the red color of nectar is a convergent trait, and that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation.

This discovery adds important information about the evolution of the avian tail and the origin of the modern avian bauplan. The presence of a fused scapulocoracoid in adult individuals independently evolved in Jinguofortisidae and Confuciusornithiformes may relate to an accelerated osteogenesis during chondrogenesis and likely formed through the heterochronic process of peramorphosis by which these basal taxa retain the scapulocoracoid of the nonavian theropod ancestors with the addition of flight-related modifications.

This comes from analysis of observations showing that stratospheric water vapor increases with tropospheric temperature, implying the existence of a stratospheric water vapor feedback. We estimate the strength of this feedback in a chemistry–climate model to be +0.3 W/(m2⋅K), which would be a significant contributor to the overall climate sensitivity. One-third of this feedback comes from increases in water vapor entering the stratosphere through the tropical tropopause layer, with the rest coming from increases in water vapor entering through the extratropical tropopause. This finding is important for understanding the causes of past climate change and for predicting future climate change. It also has implications for the causes of the current warming. The feedback is likely to be positive in the current climate, but it is not clear whether it will remain positive in the future. This is an important question for climate research."

The presence of these colors is often associated with a specific function, such as camouflage. In this study, we show that the presence of blue-green colors in vertebrates is not a coincidence, but rather a functional trait that has evolved multiple times during vertebrate evolution. We also describe a new function for a member of the serpin superfamily, which is the largest and most ubiquitous group of protease inhibitors."

We report that hypoxia induces expression of AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), an m6A demethylase, which demethylated NANOG mRNA at an m6A residue in the 3′-UTR. Increased NANOG mRNA and protein expression, and the breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) phenotype, were induced by hypoxia in an HIF- and ALKBH5-dependent manner. Insertion of the NANOG 3′-UTR into a luciferase reporter gene led to regulation of luciferase activity by O2, HIFs, and ALKBH5, which was lost upon mutation of the methylated residue. ALKBH5 overexpression decreased NANOG mRNA methylation, increased NANOG levels, and increased the percentage of BCSCs, phenocopying the effect of hypoxia. Thus, HIF-dependent ALKBH5 expression mediates enrichment of BCSCs in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. These findings suggest that ALKBH5 may be a therapeutic target for cancer treatment.

The source of the parchment, often called “uterine vellum,” has been a long-standing controversy in codicology. Here, we report a simple and objective method to identify the animal origin of parchment. The method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals, but did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides. These results suggest that ultrafine vellum does not necessarily derive from the use of abortive or newborn animals with ultrathin hides, but could equally well reflect a production process that allowed the skins of maturing animals of several species to be rendered into vellum of equal quality and fineness. This method could be used to identify the source of parchment from the earliest pocket Bibles"

The age model for this event is critical for understanding its cause and the controls on extinction/recovery dynamics. We present a precise age model for the extinction and recovery interval at Meishan, China, based on U-Pb dating of volcanic ash beds. The extinction occurred between 251.941 ± 0.037 and 251.880 ± 0.031 Mya, an interval of 60 ± 48 ka. Onset of a major reorganization of the carbon cycle precedes the extinction and is punctuated by a sharp (3‰), short-lived negative spike in the isotopic composition of carbonate carbon. Decamillenial to millennial level resolution of the mass extinction and its aftermath will permit a refined evaluation of the relative roles of rate-dependent processes contributing to the extinction, allowing insight into postextinction ecosystem expansion. This age model will also be critical for evaluating the plausibility of trigger and kill mechanisms. (PsycINFO Database Record"

Here, we generate intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific RORα-deficient (RORαΔIEC) mice and find that RORα is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis by attenuating nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcriptional activity. RORαΔIEC mice exhibit excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis reveals corecruitment of RORα and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) on NF-κB target promoters and subsequent dismissal of CREB binding protein (CBP) and bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) for transcriptional repression. Together, we demonstrate that RORα/HDAC3-mediated attenuation of NF-κB signaling controls the balance of inflammatory responses, and therapeutic strategies targeting this epigenetic regulation could be beneficial to"

The Black and Latino populations are estimated to experience declines in life expectancy at birth of 2.10 and 3.05 y, respectively, both of which are several times the 0.68-y reduction for Whites. Latinos, who have consistently experienced lower mortality than Whites, would see their more than 3-y survival advantage reduced to less than 1 y. These projections imply an increase of nearly 40% in the Black−White life expectancy gap, from 3.6 y to over 5 y, thereby eliminating progress made in reducing this differential since 2006.

We show that human ignitions and fire suppression have already had a strong influence on the global fire regime, and that this will continue to affect the carbon cycle. We find that changes in human demography tend to suppress global fire activity, keeping more carbon within terrestrial ecosystems and attenuating warming. However, recent and predicted future reductions in fire activity may enhance land carbon uptake and corresponding to offsetting ∼5 to 10 y of global CO2 emissions at today’s levels. This potentially reduces warming by up to 0.11 °C by 2100. We show that ignitions and active and passive fire suppression can be as important in driving future fire regimes as changes in climate, although with some risk of more extreme fires regionally. Our study highlights the importance of fire in the climate system and the need for more research on the role of human ignitions and fire suppression. (PsycINFO Database Record"

In this study, we show that the squid Euprymna scolopes regulates the activities of its luminescent symbionts through the strategic delivery of a single glycan, chitin. Chitin is a major component of the squid’s own exoskeleton, and its provision to the symbiotic organ only at dusk is timed to coincide with the maturation of the organ. This timing is critical for the persistence of the symbionts, which are dependent on the catabolism of chitin for their own survival. Our results suggest that other hosts may similarly regulate the activities of their associated microbes through the strategic provision of specific nutrients, whose catabolism modulates conditions like pH or anoxia in their symbionts’ habitat. This strategy may be particularly important for animals that live in complex, dynamic environments. (Read more)"

We introduce a method to identify topics in text data and represent documents as topic sequences. We apply our method to a prominent example of underutilized text: the US National Violent Death Reporting System. We identify 225 latent topics in the narratives of violent deaths. Many of these topics are not captured by existing structured variables. We also identify the gender bias of our topics and show that our method can reveal gendered patterns in reporting about lethal violence. Our method offers a flexible and broadly applicable approach to model topics in text data. It can be applied to many domains and can be extended to other types of data. It can also be used to study the gendered nature of topics in text data.

This pandemic is generally understood as the consequence of a singular introduction of the bacterium, after which the disease established itself in European rodents over four centuries. To locate these putative plague reservoirs, we studied the climate fluctuations that preceded regional plague epidemics, based on a dataset of 7,711 georeferenced historical plague outbreaks and 15 annually resolved tree-ring records from Europe and Asia. We provide evidence for repeated climate-driven reintroductions of the bacterium into European harbors from reservoirs in Asia, with a delay of 15 ± 1 y. Our analysis finds no support for the existence of permanent plague reservoirs in medieval Europe. Instead, we find that the disease was likely introduced into Europe repeatedly, with a delay of 15 ± 1 y, from reservoirs in Asia. This finding challenges the traditional view of a single introduction of the plague bacterium into Europe. It also suggests that the disease was not established in Europe for centuries after the first introduction, and that the disease was likely introduced repeatedly. This finding has implications for"

The interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) is expressed on candidate leukemic stem cells in the majority of AML patients, but not on normal hematopoietic stem cells. We show here that monoclonal antibodies targeting IL1RAP have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. (PsycINFO Database Record"

The settlement history of Madagascar is contentious, so we used the genomic data to test the hypothesis of a single settlement from Africa or Asia. We find that the settlement was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. This study provides a unique view of the human population of Madagascar. It also provides a framework for understanding the human population of other islands in the Indian Ocean. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

We also show that this index can be used to monitor crop status and provide earlier and more precise predictions of crop yields than official USDA forecasts released midseason. Our results demonstrate the potential of using crop expert assessments to monitor crop status and predict crop yields. This can help farmers and policy makers to better manage agricultural production and mitigate the impact of crop anomalies."

We synthesize the largest global dataset to date of soil respiration, moisture, and temperature measurements, totaling &gt;3,800 observations representing 27 temperature manipulation studies, spanning nine biomes and over 2 decades of warming. Our analysis reveals no significant differences in the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration between control and warmed plots in all biomes, with the exception of deserts and boreal forests. Thus, our data provide limited evidence of acclimation of soil respiration to experimental warming in several major biome types, contrary to the results from multiple single-site studies. Our analysis adds a unique cross-biome perspective on the temperature response of soil respiration, information critical to improving our mechanistic understanding of how soil carbon dynamics change with climatic warming. The Gaussian response of soil respiration to warming across all biomes suggests that rising global temperatures may result in regionally variable responses in soil respiration, with colder climates being considerably more responsive to increased ambient temperatures compared with warmer regions.

We present a model of the trajectory of plastid genome evolution during the transition from autotrophy to a nonphotosynthetic parasitic lifestyle. We show that the loss of photosynthesis is linked to the parasite’s dependence on a host to fulfill its life cycle, rather than the loss of photosynthesis. Our findings suggest that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner.

We use a high-resolution large ensemble to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the probability of occurrence of multiyear rainfall deficits in southwestern South Africa. We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% by the year 2100 under an intermediate-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5) and to 80% under a high-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5-8.5). These results highlight the strong sensitivity of the drought risk in SSA to future anthropogenic emissions. This work is important for informing the development of adaptation strategies.

We also find that the probability of drought has increased because of the increased likelihood of co-occurring warm and dry conditions. This finding is important because it suggests that anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of the extremely warm and dry conditions that have created the acute human and ecosystem impacts associated with the 2012–2014 drought.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. Our study provides a molecular mechanism for autism and suggests that the forgetting process is a common target for autism-risk genes. This study also provides a new approach to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms.

Here, we use NMR-assisted crystallography to characterize the structure and reactivity of this intermediate. The results show that the α-aminoacrylate hydroxyl leaves the β-carbon, and the reaction proceeds through a transition state with the substrate indole bound in the active site. The results also show that the crystallographic water molecule is hydrogen bonded to the βLys ε-amino group, and that this water molecule is essential for the reaction. The results are used to understand why benzimidazole, an isostere of the natural substrate indole, does not react, while indole does. The results are also used to propose a mechanism for the reaction of the α-aminoacrylate intermediate with benzimidazole. The results are significant for understanding the mechanism of this and other β-elimination and replacement reactions catalyzed by enzymes that use pyridoxal-5′-phosphate as a cofactor.

In this study, we show that the squid Euprymna scolopes regulates the activities of its luminescent symbionts through the strategic delivery of a single glycan, chitin. Chitin is a major component of the squid’s own exoskeleton, and its provision to the symbiotic organ only at dusk is timed to coincide with the maturation of the organ. This timing is critical for the persistence of the symbionts, which are dependent on the catabolism of chitin for their own survival. Our results suggest that other hosts may similarly regulate the activities of their associated microbes through the strategic provision of specific nutrients, whose catabolism modulates conditions like pH or anoxia in their symbionts’ habitat. This strategy may be particularly important for animals that live in complex, dynamic environments. (Read more)"

In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We found that the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion. For the N3-EtdT lesion that disrupts base pairing, multiple transcriptional lesion bypass routes were found. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop).

To infect human cells, MERS-CoV must first bind to cell receptors and then fuse with the cell membrane. The spike (S) glycoproteins are the viral receptors and fusion-activating proteins, and they are cleaved sequentially during virus entry into cells. Here, we show that the first S cleavage is required for MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but not into other cell types. This requirement for the first cleavage correlates with S conformations during entry, and the uncleaved MERS viruses are more infectious into human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they have sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, the first S cleavage may be a significant determinant of MERS-CoV virulence. Understanding how this cleavage contributes to MERS-CoV infection may help to develop more effective vaccines and therapeutics. (Read more)"

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive design-based analysis of the effect of universal vote-by-mail—a policy under which every voter is mailed a ballot in advance of the election—on electoral outcomes. We find that 1) universal vote-by-mail does not appear to affect either party’s share of turnout, 2) universal vote-by-mail does not appear to increase either party’s vote share, and 3) universal vote-by-mail modestly increases overall average turnout rates, in line with previous estimates. All three conclusions support the conventional wisdom of election administration experts and contradict many popular claims in the media.

The underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Here, we show that altered nutrient cycling during heat stress is a primary driver of the functional breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis. We demonstrate that heat stress increased the metabolic energy demand of the coral host, which was compensated by the catabolic degradation of amino acids. The resulting shift from net uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont subsequently promoted the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host. Energy limitation and altered symbiotic nutrient cycling are thus key factors in the early heat stress response, directly contributing to the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis. Interpreting the stability of the coral holobiont in light of its metabolic interactions provides a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

We also show that inhibiting JNK signaling or depleting the microbiome can restore intestinal barrier function and host–microbe homeostasis. Our work identifies a JNK-dependent feedback amplification loop between intestinal tumors and the microbiome. It also highlights the importance of controlling the activity level of JNK signaling to maintain epithelial barrier function and host–microbe homeostasis.

Here, we identify a form of regeneration in the adult nervous system that is independent of the MAPK signaling cascade, which is the major pathway for regeneration in the CNS of other organisms. This form of regeneration is triggered by physical lesion of a sensory neuron and is enhanced by disrupting calcium channels and elevating cAMP levels. These findings suggest that this form of regeneration may be a powerful platform for discovery of genes involved in neuronal regeneration in the adult mammalian CNS. Moreover, this study unites disparate forms of regeneration to uncover fresh molecular insights into activity-dependent control of the adult nervous system’s intrinsic regenerative capacity.

We found that the dominant metabolic RSN in healthy subjects was topographically similar to the default mode network. In contrast, in Parkinson’s disease (PD), this RSN was subordinated to an independent disease-related pattern. Network functionality was assessed by quantifying metabolic RSN expression in cerebral blood flow PET scans acquired at rest and during task performance. We found that the dominant RSN was deactivated during task performance, and that this abnormality was partially corrected by dopaminergic therapy. In Alzheimer’s disease, significant reductions in network expression were already present at diagnosis, progressing over time.

Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

But how do we know when two people are connected? We asked pairs of friends and strangers to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Finally, we demonstrate that this signal is used by third-party listeners as a heuristic of how well people are connected: Conversations with faster response times were perceived as more connected than the same conversations with slower response times. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

Although the function of Si in plant physiology has been well established, its role in plant defense against insect herbivory has not been well characterized. In this study, we demonstrate that Si pretreatment enhances rice resistance against the rice leaffolder, a major insect pest, in wild-type rice plants but not in plants with RNAi-mediated gene silencing of jasmonate biosynthesis and perception genes. This interaction between Si and jasmonates is mediated by jasmonates, which promote Si accumulation in rice plants. These results suggest that Si and jasmonates interact in rice defense against insect herbivory. This interaction may be a general phenomenon in plants. (Read more)"

Here we propose a mechanism for memory that is based on changes in the excitability of neurons. We show that changes in the strength of synaptic connections can lead to changes in the firing rates of neurons. These changes in firing rates can then be used to store information in a dynamic memory register. We show that this mechanism is sensitive to context and serial order which makes it suitable for temporal integration in sequence processing within the language domain. This work provides a step toward a computational neurobiology of language.

In the United States, the majority of nutrient loading to lakes comes from small tributaries that drain surrounding watersheds. However, decades of monitoring and regulatory efforts have focused on large watersheds, leaving small tributaries largely unaddressed. We show that small tributaries can be a significant source of nutrients to lakes, especially in the form of dissolved inorganic nutrients. Our findings suggest that nutrient management efforts should be expanded to small tributaries to reduce the ecological impacts of nutrient loading on valuable nearshore ecosystems. This could be accomplished by targeting the most important tributaries for nutrient management, which are likely to be the most vulnerable to nutrient loading."

This behavior is reminiscent of the “saddle-node” bifurcation, which is a well-known phenomenon in dynamical systems. We also find that the dynamics of the system are sensitive to the details of the environmental forcing, and that the system can exhibit a variety of behaviors, including oscillations and chaos, depending on the details of the forcing. These results have implications for understanding the dynamics of complex systems in general, and for understanding the behavior of chemical systems in particular."

We show that RSPO certification reduced deforestation in Indonesia from 2001 to 2015. However, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results suggest that certification is not a silver bullet for reducing deforestation, but it is an important tool in the toolbox of policies to reduce deforestation.

Investigation of the dynamic regulation of the exocyst-related processes using mutants in genetically tractable organisms such as Arabidopsis thaliana is limited by the lethality or the severity of phenotypes. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 (exocyst component of 70 kDa) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking.

In many vertebrates, sex is determined by a single locus, but in others, multiple loci interact to produce more than two genotypic sexes.

We find that multiple alleles can produce modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics, and that the acquisition of a new sex determination allele can produce additional axes of variation for sexual traits. These results have implications for understanding the evolution and maintenance of sex determination alleles. They also suggest that the modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics may be a general consequence of multiple interacting sex determination alleles. This modularity may be a key factor in the maintenance of sex determination alleles in populations. The modularity of secondary sexual characteristics produced by multiple interacting sex determination alleles may also be a factor in the evolution of sex determination in species that have lost or gained sex determination alleles."

We show that the increase in vehicle weight has propagated subsoil compaction into deeper soil layers, which now exceeds safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the discovery of a 130-million-year-old footprint of a sauropod, a giant plant-eating dinosaur, in the Morrison Formation of Colorado"
