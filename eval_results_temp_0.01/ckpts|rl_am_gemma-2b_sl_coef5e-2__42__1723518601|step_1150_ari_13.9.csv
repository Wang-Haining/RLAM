However, it is not a theory in the ordinary sense of the word, in that it is not based on a formal axiomatic system. This has led to a number of attempts to provide a foundation for quantum theory, and in particular to find a mathematical structure that is equivalent to the category of linear operators on the complex numbers, the category of complex Hilbert spaces, and the category of complex C*-algebras. We provide such an axiomatization, which is purely categorical and does not presuppose any analytical structure.

The evolutionary origin of the myxozoan body plan, which is characterized by a distinctive polar capsule, is unknown. Here, we present the first comparative genomic analysis of two myxozoan species and the cnidarian parasite Polypodium hydriforme. Our results show that myxozoans are a sister group to the cnidarian parasite P. hydriforme and that the myxozoan body plan is the result of extreme genome reduction. Our findings suggest that the transition from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic myxozoan was accompanied by a dramatic reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insight into the origin of the Myxozoa and the evolution of parasitic lifestyles. (Read more)"

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the host antiviral response and may help to design new antiviral strategies against COVID-19.

Zinc is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of zinc inhibition of the proton channel. We find that zinc binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric channels, suggesting that the zinc-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how zinc inhibits the proton channel will further our understanding of the channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for the proton channel.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is largely unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa in the field. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammal species in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of species matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammal assemblages, and that large mammal diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results highlight the importance of diet composition in determining the coexistence of species, and suggest that the role of large mammals in African savanna biodiversity may be more complex than previously thought.

Our observations of the size distribution of floating plastic debris point at important size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered.

A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious individuals.

Our findings suggest that the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling should be carefully considered. Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated."

This finding is important because the NWFP was based on science and incorporated adaptive management. Our results suggest that the NWFP was not successful in reversing the decline of older-forest–associated bird populations, and that the policy needs to be revised to ensure the conservation of these species."

Computational approaches are essential tools to this end since their application enables fast and early strategical decisions in the drug development process. Here, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. This work provides a proof of concept for the use of computational approaches in the rational design of new antibiotics. The design strategy presented here can be applied to other antibiotic classes and to other targets. This approach can be used to design new antibiotics for the treatment of infectious diseases.

However, the number of trainable parameters in these networks is often very large, which makes it difficult to train the networks with large datasets. Here, we introduce a network architecture that is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters, and that can be trained with a small number of images. The proposed network architecture is based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters, and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters. This makes the proposed architecture more suitable for applications that require training with a small number of images."

We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor.

Severing is a key process in many cellular processes, including cell migration and cytokinesis. However, the mechanism by which ADF severes filaments is not well understood. Here, we show that the action of ADF is enhanced by mechanical forces. We propose that this mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of mechanical forces in severing and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for actin-based diseases.

We used a grid-based approach to sample at high resolution the genomic diversity (including maternal lineages, paternal lineages, and genome-wide data) across 257 villages and 2,704 Malagasy individuals. We find a common Bantu and Austronesian descent for all Malagasy individuals with a limited paternal contribution from Europe and the Middle East. Admixture and demographic growth happened recently, suggesting a rapid settlement of Madagascar during the last millennium. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. Our results provide insights into the settlement history of Madagascar and the origin of the Malagasy people. They also highlight the importance of considering the spatial resolution of the sampling when studying the human population history of an island. This article is protected by copyright.

This study shows that the evolution of an aquatic lifestyle is driving three of the four extant aquatic mammal clades toward a size attractor at ∼500 kg. The existence of this body size attractor and the relatively rapid selection toward, and limited deviation from, this attractor rule out most hypothesized drivers of size increase. These three independent body size increases and a shared aquatic optimum size are consistent with control by differences in the scaling of energetic intake and cost functions with body size between the terrestrial and aquatic realms. Under this energetic model, thermoregulatory costs constrain minimum size, whereas limitations on feeding efficiency constrain maximum size. The optimum size occurs at an intermediate value where thermoregulatory costs are low but feeding efficiency remains high. Rather than being released from size pressures, water-dwelling mammals are driven and confined to larger body sizes by the strict energetic demands of the aquatic medium. This study provides a quantitative test of the energetic constraints on mammalian body size and the evolution of aquatic lifestyles. It also provides a new perspective on the evolution of mammalian body size and the role of aquatic lifestyles in driving the evolution of larger body size."

We also show that female-derived proteins become enriched in the sperm proteome after mating, suggesting that the female reproductive tract provides a source of proteins to support sperm viability during the prolonged period between copulation and fertilization. Our research provides a comprehensive characterization of the posttesticular life history of the Drosophila sperm proteome and expands our understanding of the critical process of sperm–FRT interactions.

We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

The auditory organs of animals are extremely diverse in anatomy after hundreds of millions of years of evolution, yet they are all made up of cellular tissue and are morphologically part of the body of the animal. Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. We find that the spider’s web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to sense the motion of web threads, which is better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself. The outsourcing and supersizing of auditory function in spiders provide unique features for studying extended and regenerative sensing and designing novel acoustic flow detectors for precise fluid dynamic measurement and manipulation.

We present a systematic approach to identify and prioritize wildlife viruses with the greatest potential to spillover and spread in humans. We developed a web tool, SpillOver, that allows users to explore the results and use the information to inform research and public health interventions. SpillOver is a living, interactive database that can be refined over time to continue to improve the quality and public availability of information on viral threats to human health. We hope that SpillOver will be used by policy makers and health scientists to inform research and public health interventions for prevention and rapid control of disease outbreaks."

The color of nectar is an important trait that attracts animals, but the mechanisms by which plants produce colored nectar are poorly understood. We show that the red color of the nectar of Nesocodon mauritianus is derived from a previously undescribed alkaloid, nesocodin. We also identify nesocodin in the red nectar of the distantly related and hummingbird-visited Jaltomata herrerae and provide molecular evidence for convergent evolution of this trait. Our findings suggest that the red pigment is selectively favored and that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation. This work provides insights into the evolution of a key trait in the plant–animal mutualism. (Read more)"

This heterogeneity is also reflected in the collective genetic ancestry of a group of women with artificial skull deformations, who appear to have originated in southeastern Europe. In addition, we show that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago. These results indicate that complex demographic processes during the Early Medieval period may have contributed in an unexpected way to shape the modern European genetic landscape. Our results also highlight the need for a better understanding of the processes that shaped the genetic history of Europe."

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions.

One of the most important proteins involved in the replication of the lagging strand is the sliding clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). The PCNA sliding clamp is responsible for the formation of a complex with DNA polymerase δ (pol δ) that is essential for the synthesis of the lagging strand. The stability of this complex is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. We developed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. The results indicate that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This work provides a deeper understanding of the mechanism of lagging strand synthesis and the role of the PCNA sliding clamp in the replication of the human genome. This knowledge will be useful in the development of new therapeutic strategies for cancer and infectious diseases.

We show that RNA polymerase ribozymes can synthesize RNA molecules from an RNA template, and that they can amplify RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins.

This perturbation of the microbiota influences the integrity of the peritrophic matrix and gut barrier, which are critical obstacles for Anaplasma colonization.

Here, we report the intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific deletion of RORα (RORαΔIEC) in mice. We find that RORα is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis by attenuating nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcriptional activity. RORαΔIEC mice exhibit excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis reveals corecruitment of RORα and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) on NF-κB target promoters and subsequent dismissal of CREB binding protein (CBP) and bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) for transcriptional repression. Together, we demonstrate that RORα/HDAC3-mediated attenuation of NF-κB signaling controls the balance of inflammatory responses, and therapeutic strategies targeting this epigenetic regulation could be"

The Black and Latino populations are estimated to experience declines in life expectancy at birth of 2.10 and 3.05 y, respectively, both of which are several times the 0.68-y reduction for Whites.

The mutualistic partners, however, are often very different in terms of size, physiology, and biochemistry. This study shows that the provision of a single glycan, chitin, by the host to its symbiont, Vibrio fischeri, is a key factor in the establishment and maintenance of the symbiosis. The glycan is provided by the host only at night, when the symbiont is active, and its catabolism is required for the host to maintain a healthy symbiosis. This glycan-mediated regulation of the symbiont’s activity may be a common mechanism of host control over the activities of symbiotic microbes in other animal-microbe associations. This study provides a new perspective on the symbiosis between animals and microbes, and it may lead to the development of new approaches for the control of microbial infections. (Read more)"

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA. Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

The conversion of solar energy to chemical energy is accomplished by the capture of light by pigments, which are modified tetrapyrroles. The biosynthesis of these pigments is among the most productive biological pathways on Earth. The formation of the fifth ring of (bacterio)chlorophylls is a key step in this process, and has remained enigmatic for more than 60 y. This reaction is catalyzed by two unrelated enzymes, using different chemistries. The majority of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria use a [4Fe-4S] cluster protein, BchE, whereas plants, cyanobacteria, and some phototrophic bacteria possess a diiron protein, AcsF. Plant and cyanobacterial mutants in ycf54 display impaired function of the diiron enzyme, accumulating the reaction substrate. Swapping cyclases between cyanobacteria and purple phototrophic bacteria reveals three classes of the diiron enzyme. AcsF from the purple betaproteobacterium Rubrivivax (Rvi.) gelatinosus rescues the loss not only of its cyanobacterial ortholog, cycI, in Synechocystis sp. PCC "

The genetic basis of autism is so complicated that it is difficult to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. Our findings provide a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral deficits in autism and may facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies. This article is protected by copyright.

The food choices of the population have a large influence on these emissions, and thus on climate change. Increasing the proportion of vegetarian meals in catering outlets is a simple and effective way to reduce the environmental impact of the food system. This study shows that doubling the proportion of vegetarian meals available in a catering outlet increased the proportion of vegetarian meals purchased by 61.8% in the experimental study and by 78.8% in the observational study. This increase in vegetarian meals was sustained over the course of the year. These results provide robust evidence to support the potential for simple changes to catering practices to make an important contribution to achieving more sustainable diets at the population level. This approach could be applied to other dietary choices, such as reducing the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages. It could also be applied to other sectors, such as the home, to increase the proportion of sustainable diets."

We find that each oncogene has somewhat different surfaceomes, but the functions of these proteins are harmonized by common biological themes including up-regulation of nutrient transporters, down-regulation of adhesion molecules and tumor suppressing phosphatases, and alteration in immune modulators. These studies provide a broad systems-level view of how specific driver oncogenes remodel the surfaceome and the glycoproteome in a cell autologous fashion, and suggest possible surface targets, and combinations thereof, for drug and biomarker discovery.

What are the effects of vote-by-mail? In this paper, we provide a comprehensive design-based analysis of the effect of universal vote-by-mail—a policy under which every voter is mailed a ballot in advance of the election—on electoral outcomes. We find that universal vote-by-mail does not appear to affect either party’s share of turnout, does not appear to increase either party’s vote share, and modestly increases overall average turnout rates, in line with previous estimates. All three conclusions support the conventional wisdom of election administration experts and contradict many popular claims in the media. Our findings suggest that vote-by-mail is a safe and effective way to conduct elections during the pandemic."

These effects, except for the increased expression of CRF itself, could all be blocked by pretreatment with an antagonist of the CRF receptor CRFR1. We also show that, in cultured astrocytes, hypoxic increase in CRF, acting through CRFR1, triggers signaling of cAMP/PKA, intracellular Ca2+, and PKCε, and that the up-regulated cAMP/PKA signaling contributes to the phosphorylation and expression of AQP4 to enhance water influx into astrocytes and produces an up-regulation of ET-1 expression.

However, the generation of ECs has been difficult to achieve, and the minimum number of transcription factors that directly induce EC development remains undefined. Here, we demonstrate that ets variant 2 (ETV2) alone can directly convert primary human adult skin fibroblasts into functional vascular endothelial cells (ETVECs). In coordination with endogenous FOXC2 in fibroblasts, transduced ETV2 elicits expression of multiple key endothelial development factors, including FLI1, ERG, and TAL1, and induces expression of endothelial functional molecules, including EGFL7 and von Willebrand factor. Consequently, ETVECs exhibits EC characteristics in vitro and forms mature functional vasculature in Matrigel plugs transplanted in NOD SCID mice. Furthermore, ETVECs significantly improve blood flow recovery in a hind limb ischemic model using BALB/c-nu mice. Our study indicates that the creation of ETVECs provides further understanding of human EC development induced by ETV2.

The genome of influenza A viruses is segmented into eight fragments, which offers evolutionary advantages but complicates genomic packaging. The selective packaging of the viral genome is a fundamental process in the life cycle of the virus, but its molecular details remain unknown. Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus. We show that this interaction takes place in infected cells and is required for optimal viral replication. Disruption of this interaction decreases the amount of viral RNA in the viral particles, resulting in an eightfold increase in empty viral particles. Our experiments indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions. The lack of conservation of these interactions might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses.

We show that human-caused wildfires have expanded the geographic and seasonal extent of wildfire, and that the human-caused fire season is three times longer than the lightning-caused fire season. Actions to reduce the risk of wildfire should focus on reducing the number of ignitions, and increasing management in regions where human-caused wildfires are dominant.

Here, we identify a form of regeneration that is remarkably independent of the MAPK signaling pathway, which is the primary pathway known to mediate regeneration in the adult mammalian CNS. This discovery opens the door to a new approach for identifying genes and pathways that control regeneration in the adult CNS. Moreover, we show that this form of regeneration is triggered by a form of activity that is common to both regeneration and injury. These findings suggest that this form of regeneration may be a powerful platform for the discovery of new regenerative mechanisms."

We also show that the distribution of recombination is similar to that observed in yeast and in mice, suggesting that the mechanisms underlying these patterns are ancient and conserved. Finally, we show that the distribution of recombination is correlated with the distribution of gene promoters, suggesting that the distribution of recombination is a consequence of the distribution of genes.

The identification of these networks is a major challenge in the field of functional brain imaging. Here, we show that the dominant resting state network in healthy subjects is topographically similar to the DMN. In Parkinson’s disease, the DMN-like dominant network is subordinated to a disease-related pattern. Network functionality was assessed by quantifying the expression of the dominant networks in healthy subjects and PD patients during rest and during task performance. Network deactivation was reduced in early PD, and this abnormality was partially corrected by dopaminergic therapy. Network expression was associated with cognitive function in Alzheimer’s disease. These results provide a direct link between the resting brain and its functional properties. They also suggest that the DMN may be a target for therapeutic interventions in neurodegenerative diseases. This work provides a new perspective on the study of the resting brain."

However, the role of FSIP1 in the progression and drug sensitivity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. (PsycINFO Database Record"

Here we show that these two factors interact to alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We found that changes in temperature systematically altered the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures departed from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increased, meaning that more species were required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. Our findings have important implications for our ability to predict the impacts of climate change on ecosystem functioning. They also highlight the need to consider the combined effects of biodiversity loss and environmental warming in conservation and management. This is particularly important for tropical forests, where biodiversity loss and environmental warming are both high. Our results suggest that tropical forests are likely to be more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change than temperate forests."

But how do we know when two people are connected? We asked people to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. We found that the speed at which people responded to each other was a robust predictor of how connected they felt. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.” This signal is used by others to gauge connection, and it may be the key to understanding how we form and maintain social relationships."

We show that RSPO certification reduced deforestation in Indonesia from 2001 to 2015. However, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection. Our results suggest that certification is not a viable tool for halting deforestation in oil palm plantations. Nevertheless, certification may be useful in reducing the rate of deforestation in the early stages of plantation expansion. Our results also suggest that certification may be a useful tool for reducing active fire in oil palm plantations.

In humans, its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. Investigation of the dynamic regulation of the evolutionarily conserved exocyst-related processes using mutants in genetically tractable organisms such as Arabidopsis thaliana is limited by the lethality or the severity of phenotypes. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 (exocyst component of 70 kDa) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study not only provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation but also offers a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Read more)"

In vertebrates, sex is determined by a single locus, which can be male- or female-determining. In species with a single locus, sex is determined by the sex of the individual, and in species with multiple loci, sex is determined by the sex of the locus. Here we investigate the effects of multiple loci on secondary sexual characteristics in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii, where two female-determining alleles interact to produce siblings with four possible sex classes. We find that multiple loci can produce modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics, and that the introgression of a new sex determiner can create additional axes of variation for varied traits. These results provide context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of multiple sex determination alleles in populations. (Read more)"

We sought to understand how iron levels impact the retina, given that retinal pigment epithelial cells are also challenged by accumulations of vitamin A aldehyde adducts (bisretinoids) that photogenerate reactive oxygen species and photodecompose into damaging aldehyde- and dicarbonyl-bearing species. We found that iron levels impact the oxidation and degradation of the bisretinoid A2E, which is a precursor of the damaging aldehyde-bearing species. These findings suggest that iron levels impact the redox state of the retina and may contribute to the photodamage of the retina. This interpretation is supported by the observation that iron chelation decreased the photodamage of the retina. These findings may have implications for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration. (AMD). (Read more)"

The evolution of the modern human hand is a major area of debate, with the fossil record providing only fragmentary evidence. Here we report the discovery of a hand fossil from the Middle Pleistocene site of Kaitio, Kenya, that preserves the third metacarpal styloid process. This fossil provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key shared derived characteristic of modern human and Neandertal hand morphology and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato. This finding has important implications for our understanding of the evolution of the human hand and the origins of modern human-like tool use. (Read more)"

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show here that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants."
