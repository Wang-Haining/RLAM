In this work, we report the structure of ice II hydrate, which is a new phase of water. The structure of ice II hydrate is determined by in situ neutron diffraction at 480 MPa and 260 K. The guest atoms are enclathrated in water molecules to form ice II hydrate. The guest atoms have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The resolved structure is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. The density distributions indicate that the vibration of guest atoms is mainly in planes perpendicular to water channels, whereas their distributions along the channels are further constrained by interactions between adjacent guest atoms. This work provides a new route to study the structure of ice II hydrate and its application to the study of the structure of ice II.

The evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, and a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we report the results of a genomic and transcriptomic analysis of two distantly related myxozoan species and a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results show that the myxozoan degeneration was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insight into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)."

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2 in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes. We found that SARS-CoV-2 Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 evades the host immune response and may lead to the development of new strategies to combat the ongoing pandemic.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of proton channels, but the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels is not completely understood. Here, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

However, the optimum growing temperature for maize is 27 °C, and temperatures above this optimum are associated with yield reductions. We show that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields will increase to values much larger than present-day values as the Earth warms. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. They also underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance. (Less)"

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa in the field. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large herbivore species in semiarid African savanna. We found that species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption had the greatest overlap in diet. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results also highlight the importance of grasses as a food resource in semiarid savanna, and suggest that the use of DNA metabarcoding may be a powerful tool for quantifying diet breadth and composition in large herbivore communities. This approach may be applied to other ecosystems to better understand the role of large herbivores in shaping biodiversity."

However, the global load of floating plastic debris is still unknown. We show that the global load of floating plastic debris is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected.

This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered.

The grains have interstellar exposure ages of &lt;300 Ma and &gt;1 Ga, which is in agreement with theoretical estimates. The grains were part of aggregates in the interstellar medium, which were probably formed during an episode of enhanced star formation ∼7 Ga ago. Furthermore, we show that the bulk of the cosmogenic nuclides in the grains were produced in the interstellar medium and not by exposure to an enhanced particle flux of the early active sun.

In addition, we found that ferroptosis induction in cancer cells with PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway mutation results in near-complete tumor regression in preclinical models. These findings suggest that combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction may be a promising strategy for cancer therapy. (Show more)"

Here, we show that LCCBs activate STIM/ORAI-mediated Ca2+ entry in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which is required for LCCB-induced vascular remodeling. Our findings indicate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. Our study provides a mechanism of LCCB action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrates that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. This study may help to improve the safety of LCCBs in clinical practice. (Show more)"

The NWFP halted clearcutting on federal land, but this has so far been insufficient to reverse declines in older-forest–associated bird populations. Our findings highlight the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure.

We then synthesized the top-ranked compounds and tested them in vitro and in vivo. The best compounds were more active than telithromycin, the current standard of care, against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

We used a comprehensive dataset of 89 genes to estimate the phylogeny of beetles and traced the evolution of beetle genes enabling symbiont-independent digestion of lignocellulose using 154 genomes or transcriptomes. Phylogenomic analyses of these uniquely comprehensive datasets resolved previously controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, both major independent origins of specialized herbivory in beetles coincide with the first appearances of an arsenal of PCWDEs encoded in their genomes. We propose that PCWDEs enabled efficient digestion of plant tissues, including lignocellulose in cell walls, facilitating the evolution of uniquely specialized plant-feeding habits, such as leaf mining and stem and wood boring.

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal cells is not well understood. Here we show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. These data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This may have implications for the development of TRAP1-targeted therapies.

However, the mechanism by which ADF/cofilin severes filaments is not known. Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to study the action of ADF/cofilin in different mechanical situations. We find that ADF/cofilin enhances severing of filaments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist. A simple model, which faithfully recapitulates our experimental observations, indicates that the ADF/cofilin-induced twist enhances severing by 100-fold. We propose that this mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. Our work provides a mechanistic understanding of ADF/cofilin’s function in severing actin filaments. This understanding will be critical to developing new strategies to target ADF/cofilin in cells."

To understand the mechanism of temperature-dependent growth, we compared the transcriptional response of primary mouse airway epithelial cells infected with rhinovirus at 33 °C vs. 37 °C. We found that mouse airway cells infected with mouse-adapted rhinovirus exhibited a striking enrichment in expression of antiviral defense response genes at 37 °C relative to 33 °C. This correlated with significantly higher expression levels of type I and type III IFN genes and ISGs at 37 °C. Temperature-dependent IFN induction in response to rhinovirus was dependent on the MAVS protein, a key signaling adaptor of the RIG-I–like receptors (RLRs). Stimulation of primary airway cells with the synthetic RLR ligand poly I:C led to greater IFN induction at 37 °C relative to 33 °C at early time points poststimulation and to a sustained increase in the induction of ISGs at 37 °C relative to 33 °C.

However, the structural basis of antifungal activity and the mode of action of NCR peptides against plant fungal pathogens remained unknown. Here, we report the crystal structure of the antifungal NCR peptide, which is largely disordered and dynamic. We also show that this peptide exhibits potent fungicidal activity against multiple plant fungal pathogens, including Botrytis cinerea and three Fusarium spp. It binds to multiple bioactive phosphoinositides in vitro and induces reactive oxygen species in germlings of the fungal pathogen. The antifungal activity of NCR peptides is unique and may be useful for the development of new strategies for the control of plant fungal diseases.

K+ channels commonly possess two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that BK channels’ C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation.

The parasite, Plasmodium, uses a variety of mechanisms to invade the red blood cell (RBC) and cause disease. Here, we show that the malaria parasite uses a single protein, erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 (EBA175), to bind to glycophorin A (GPA) on the surface of the RBC. We show that this interaction leads to a change in the biophysical properties of the RBC, which in turn reduces a critical energy barrier to invasion. This work suggests that the malaria parasite primes the RBC surface through its binding antigens, altering the biophysical nature of the target cell and thus reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion. This finding would constitute a major change in our concept of malaria parasite invasion, suggesting it is, in fact, a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces working together to facilitate entry.

Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

This merge operation is applied equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity, providing evidence for a merge operation that applies equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity. More superficial models of language, based solely on sequential transition probability over lexical and syntactic categories, only captured activity in the posterior middle temporal gyrus. Our results suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases. This is consistent with a neural implementation of a left-corner parser.

We find that it can avoid an excess mortality rate of 3.61 million per year from outdoor air pollution worldwide.

Globally, fossil-fuel-related emissions account for about 65% of the excess mortality, and 70% of the climate cooling by anthropogenic aerosols. The chemical influence of air pollution on aeolian dust contributes to the aerosol cooling. Since aerosols mask the anthropogenic rise in global temperature, removing fossil-fuel-generated particles liberates 0.51 °C and all pollution particles 0.73 °C warming, reaching around 2 °C over North America and Northeast Asia. The steep temperature increase from removing aerosols can be moderated to about 0.36 °C globally by the simultaneous reduction of tropospheric ozone and methane.

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, in the days (Studies 1 and 2) and months (Studies 3 through 6) following the 2016 election, women’s and men’s endorsement of HM predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. In addition, as conceptualized, HM was associated with less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors. The findings highlight the importance of psychological examinations of masculinity as a cultural ideology to understand how men’s and women’s endorsement of HM legitimizes patriarchal dominance and reinforces gender, race, and class-based hierarchies via candidate support."

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. First, whereas MERS-CoV prefers human DPP4 over bat DPP4 as its receptor, HKU4 shows the opposite trend. Second, in the absence of exogenous proteases, both MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes mediate pseudovirus entry into bat cells, whereas only MERS-CoV spike, but not HKU4 spike, mediates pseudovirus entry into human cells.

The first pocket Bibles were made in the 13th century, and the source of the parchment, often called “uterine vellum,” has been a long-standing controversy in codicology. Here, we report a simple and objective method to identify the animal origin of parchment. The method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals, but did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides. These results suggest that ultrafine vellum does not necessarily derive from the use of abortive or newborn animals with ultrathin hides, but could equally well reflect a production process that allowed the skins of maturing animals of several species to be rendered into vellum of equal quality and fineness."

We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. These results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This approach may be applicable to other cancers as well. (truncated)"

The first test explosion of a nuclear bomb, the Trinity test of 16 July 1945, resulted in the fusion of surrounding sand, the test tower, and copper transmission lines into a glassy material known as “trinitite.” Here, we report the discovery, in a sample of red trinitite, of a hitherto unknown composition of icosahedral quasicrystal, Si61Cu30Ca7Fe2. It represents the oldest extant anthropogenic quasicrystal currently known, with the distinctive property that its precise time of creation is indelibly etched in history. Like the naturally formed quasicrystals found in the Khatyrka meteorite and experimental shock syntheses of quasicrystals, the anthropogenic quasicrystals in red trinitite demonstrate that transient extreme pressure–temperature conditions are suitable for the synthesis of quasicrystals and for the discovery of new quasicrystal-forming systems. This discovery has important implications for the study of quasicrystals and for the search for extraterrestrial quasicrystals. It also has"

Photosynthesis relies on these modified tetrapyrroles for the capture of solar radiation and its conversion to chemical energy. The formation of the isocyclic fifth ring, the key reaction in the biosynthesis of (bacterio)chlorophyll, has remained enigmatic for more than 60 y. This reaction is catalyzed by two unrelated cyclase enzymes using different chemistries. The majority of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria use BchE, an O2-sensitive [4Fe-4S] cluster protein, whereas plants, cyanobacteria, and some phototrophic bacteria possess an O2-dependent enzyme, the major catalytic component of which is a diiron protein, AcsF. Plant and cyanobacterial mutants in ycf54 display impaired function of the O2-dependent enzyme, accumulating the reaction substrate.

Therefore, it is difficult to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. Our study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility in autism and suggests that the forgetting process is a potential therapeutic target for autism.

The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop). The Pro-Gate loop faces toward the minor groove of RNA:DNA hybrid and is involved in modulating the translocation of minor-groove alkylated DNA template after nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion. Taken together, this work provides important mechanistic insights into transcriptional stalling, lesion bypass,"

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas the more rigid uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into endos"

We provide a global map of riverine fisheries, which reveals that 90% of global catch comes from river basins with above-average stress levels. We also show that freshwater fisheries provide the equivalent of all dietary animal protein for 158 million people, highlighting the critical role of rivers in providing locally sourced, low-cost protein. Our data can be used to inform conservation and sustainability efforts, as well as to identify regions where freshwater fisheries can contribute to food security. Our analysis also reveals the high stakes for improving fishery management, as intensive fishing in regions where rivers are already degraded by other stressors may undermine efforts to conserve biodiversity. This syndrome of poverty, nutritional deficiency, fishery dependence, and extrinsic threats to biodiverse river ecosystems underscores the high stakes for improving fishery management."

Here we show that NMDAR-Abs change the intrinsic microcircuitry of the brain, which in turn can lead to paroxysmal EEG abnormalities. We validate a dynamic model of NMDAR-Ab effects on cortical microcircuitry and show that the same changes in microcircuitry can lead to paroxysmal EEG abnormalities in the mouse model of NMDAR-Ab encephalitis. These findings offer mechanistic insights into circuit-level dysfunction induced by NMDAR-Abs and may help to explain the diverse range of EEG abnormalities observed in patients with NMDAR-Abs. They also suggest that the same changes in microcircuitry can lead to paroxysmal EEG abnormalities in other autoimmune encephalitis models. This may help to explain the diversity of EEG abnormalities observed in patients with NMDAR-Abs. Finally, our findings may help to identify biomarkers of NMDAR-Ab encephalitis. This could lead to the development of new diagnostic tests and the identification of new therapeutic targets."

Certification is the tool most used to fulfill these procurement policies, and around 20% of global palm oil production was certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) in 2017. However, the effect of certification on deforestation in oil palm plantations remains unclear. Here, we use a comprehensive dataset of RSPO-certified and noncertified oil palm plantations (∼188,000 km2) in Indonesia, the leading producer of palm oil, as well as annual remotely sensed metrics of tree cover loss and fire occurrence, to evaluate the impact of certification on deforestation and fire from 2001 to 2015. We find that certification reduced deforestation in oil palm plantations. However, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield"

In humans, its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. The study of the dynamic regulation of the evolutionarily conserved exocyst-related processes using mutants in genetically tractable organisms such as Arabidopsis thaliana is limited by the lethality or the severity of phenotypes. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 (exocyst component of 70 kDa) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and offers a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease.

In this study, we investigate the effects of multiple interacting sex determination alleles on secondary sexual characteristics in a fish species with polygenic sex determination. We find that the modularity of secondary sexual characteristics produced by polygenic sex determination provides context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of the maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations. Our results suggest that the modularity of secondary sexual characteristics may be a general feature of polygenic sex determination. This modularity may also be a general feature of sex determination in animals, and may be a useful concept for understanding the evolution of sex determination in other species. (Less)"

However, the evolution of predator specialization has been considered a dead end, as morphological and functional optimizations are often required to capture different prey types. Here, we show that siphonophores, a group of pelagic cnidarians, have evolved modularity in their prey-capture system, and that this modularity is linked to the evolution of their prey. Our findings suggest that the evolution of predator specialization is not only possible, but also linked to the evolution of modularity in prey-capture systems. These findings contribute to a broader understanding of the evolution of predator specialization and its impact on food webs. They also provide insights into the evolution of morphological innovations and diversification of ecological niches."

This fossil provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of this feature and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo.

One-carbon units are used to support cell growth, and thus are critical for cancer. Here we show that dual knockout of SHMT1 and SHMT2 in cancer cells blocks tumor growth in vivo. We also identify small-molecule dual inhibitors of SHMT1 and SHMT2, and show that they are effective in cancer cell-lines and xenograft tumors. However, one-carbon donor formate is a potent inhibitor of SHMT, and paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in a cancer cell-line screen. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of cancer. This work provides a rationale for the use of formate as a cancer therapeutic. It also provides a platform for the development of cancer-specific inhibitors of SHMT. This would be of interest to the cancer community, as well as to the broader metabolomics community.

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the discovery of a new species of sauropod in Patagonia, Argentina"
