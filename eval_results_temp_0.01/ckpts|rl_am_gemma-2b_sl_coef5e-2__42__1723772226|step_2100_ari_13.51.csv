However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa in the field. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species of large herbivores in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This study highlights the importance of diet composition in understanding the role of LMH in African savanna biodiversity. It also provides a model for the use of DNA metabarcoding to study diet composition in other systems."

This is due to the size-selective sinks of the plastic debris in the ocean interior, which are not taken into account in the models. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered.

Here, we show that housing mice in low humidity increases susceptibility to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. We find that the wispy, wheel-shaped orb web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to capture the sound-induced air particle movements that approach the maximum physical efficiency better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By sensing the motion of web threads, the spider remotely detects and localizes the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave, such as those emitted by approaching prey or predators. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,00"

We synthesize the largest global dataset to date of soil respiration, moisture, and temperature measurements, totaling &gt;3,800 observations representing 27 temperature manipulation studies, spanning nine biomes and over 2 decades of warming. Our analysis reveals no significant differences in the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration between control and warmed plots in all biomes, with the exception of deserts and boreal forests. Thus, our data provide limited evidence of acclimation of soil respiration to experimental warming in several major biome types, contrary to the results from multiple single-site studies. Our analysis adds a unique cross-biome perspective on the temperature response of soil respiration, information critical to improving our mechanistic understanding of how soil carbon dynamics change with climatic warming."

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a framework for understanding the etiology of autism and for developing therapeutic strategies. (Show more)"

We find that vote-by-mail does not appear to affect either party’s share of turnout, does not appear to increase either party’s vote share, and modestly increases overall average turnout rates. These findings support the conventional wisdom of election administration experts and contradict many popular claims in the media.

We also show that, in cultured primary astrocytes, hypoxia triggers cortical release of CRF, which acts on CRF receptor type 1 (CRFR1) to trigger signaling of cAMP/PKA, intracellular Ca2+, and PKCε, leading to up-regulation of AQP4 and cerebral edema. Finally, using CHO cells transfected with CRFR1+ and AQP4+, we show that transfected CRFR1+ contributes to edema via transfected AQP4+. In conclusion, hypoxic cerebral edema is mediated by CRF, which acts on CRFR1 to trigger signaling of cAMP/PKA in cortical astrocytes, leading to activation of AQP4 and cerebral edema.

This hypothesis has been tested using functional MRI, but the results are controversial. Here, we used metabolic PET, which maps nonfluctuating signals related to total activity, to identify and validate reproducible RSN topographies in healthy and disease populations. We found that the dominant RSN in healthy subjects was topographically similar to the default mode network. In contrast, in Parkinson’s disease (PD), this RSN was subordinated to an independent disease-related pattern. Network functionality was assessed by quantifying metabolic RSN expression in cerebral blood flow PET scans acquired at rest and during task performance. We observed that the dominant RSN was deactivated during task performance in healthy subjects and early PD patients, but not in advanced PD. This abnormality was partially corrected by dopaminergic therapy. Time-course comparisons of DMN loss in longitudinal resting metabolic scans from PD and Alzheimer’s disease subjects illustrated that significant reductions appeared later for PD, in parallel with the development of cognitive dysfunction. In contrast, in Alzheimer’s disease significant reductions in network expression were already present"

We report the discovery of a series of small-molecule dual inhibitors of human serine hydroxymethyltransferse 1 (SHMT1) and 2 (SHMT2), which are effective in vitro and in vivo. We also report the discovery of a second series of small-molecule SHMT inhibitors, which are effective in vitro and in vivo, but are more effective in cancer cell lines that are deficient in glycine import. This latter class of SHMT inhibitor is a promising lead for the treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a cancer that is particularly sensitive to SHMT inhibition. Thus, the discovery of these two classes of SHMT inhibitors is a significant advance in the treatment of cancer."

This is a significant finding given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. The study also highlights the importance of considering the role of natural landscapes in meeting nutrition goals, particularly in rural areas of low- and middle-income countries. This study has implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals."

We show that the weight of modern farm machinery has increased by a factor of 10 since the 1950s, and that the compaction of subsoil, which is the main reservoir of soil organic matter, has now become a widespread problem. We also show that the weight of modern farm machinery is now comparable to that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, suggesting that the compaction of soil by these prehistoric giants may have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles. This suggests that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This may have been a key factor in the success of agriculture, and may have contributed to the success of sauropods."
