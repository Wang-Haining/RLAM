The Copenhagen interpretation, which has been widely accepted, is based on a set of axioms that are not fully satisfactory. In this paper, we propose a set of axioms that are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. The axioms are sufficient to guarantee that a category is equivalent to that of continuous linear functions between Hilbert spaces. This addresses a question about the foundations of quantum theory raised in reconstruction programs such as those of von Neumann, Mackey, Jauch, Piron, Abramsky, and Coecke. The axioms are also useful for studying the category of Hilbert spaces and continuous linear operators between them."

Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. To gain insight into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite, we compared the transcriptome and genome of two distantly related myxozoan species to the transcriptome and genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content.

Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We found that SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This mechanism may be relevant for other viruses that use the Nup98-Rae1 complex to evade IFN. Our findings may provide new targets for antiviral therapy. Copyright © 2020.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1 channels, but the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1 is not completely understood. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

We quantify the magnitude of this yield variability and its consequences for global maize production and trade. We find that the probability that the top four maize-exporting countries have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammalian herbivore species in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results highlight the importance of diet composition in determining trophic interactions and biodiversity in herbivore communities. These insights are particularly relevant in light of the increasing human population’s demand for food and fiber, which is expected to drive dramatic changes in land use and biodiversity.

Our observations of the size distribution of floating plastic debris point at important size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered.

To control each function, the endothelium processes endlessly arriving requests from multiple sources using separate clusters of cells specialized to detect specific stimuli. A well-developed but poorly understood communication system operates between cells to integrate multiple lines of information and coordinate endothelial responses. Here, the nature of the communication network has been addressed using single-cell Ca2+ imaging across thousands of endothelial cells in intact blood vessels.

Highly correlated Ca2+ activities occurred in scattered cell clusters, and network communication links between them exhibited unexpectedly short path lengths. The number of connections between cells (degree distribution) followed a power-law relationship revealing a scale-free network topology.

The hemoglobin expression pattern in human erythrocytes is heterochronic, with fetal hemoglobin (HbF) being expressed in the fetus and newborn and adult hemoglobin (HbA) being expressed in adults. The HbF/HbA ratio is a marker of fetal and neonatal hemoglobin expression. Here we show that the insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) is expressed in human erythroid tissues and is developmentally downregulated in human fetal liver and upregulated in adult bone marrow. IGF2BP1 overexpression in human erythroid cells causes a nearly complete reversal of the adult hemoglobin expression pattern toward a more fetal-like pattern. This reversal is mediated by reduced expression of the transcription factor BCL11A. These results suggest a mechanism for chronoregulation of fetal and adult hemoglobin expression in humans. The HbF/HbA ratio may be a marker of fetal and neonatal hemoglobin expression. This study provides a mechanism for the HbF/HbA ratio to be a fetal and neonatal hemoglobin expression marker."

In this study, we found that activating mutation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) function, highly frequent events in human cancer, confers ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells. This resistance requires sustained activation of mTORC1 and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)C1-dependent induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. Furthermore, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a transcriptional target of SREBP1, mediates the ferroptosis-suppressing activity of SREBP1 by producing monounsaturated fatty acids. Genetic or pharmacologic ablation of SREBP1 or SCD1 sensitized ferroptosis in cancer cells with PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway mutation. Conversely, ectopic expression of SREPB1 or SCD1 restored ferroptosis resistance in these cells, even when mTORC1 was inhibited. In xen"

The underlying molecular mechanisms of hypertension-induced heart failure are not fully understood. Here, we show that voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channel (Cav1.2) blockers (LCCBs) activate store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and promote VSMC remodeling. LCCBs act on the STIM N terminus to cause STIM relocalization to junctions and subsequent ORAI activation in a Cav1.2-independent and store depletion-independent manner. LCCB-induced promotion of VSMC remodeling requires STIM1, which is up-regulated in VSMCs from hypertensive rats. Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. Our findings unravel a mechanism of LCCBs action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI.

The NWFP’s policy of maintaining older forests is still needed to stabilize populations of these species. The NWFP also failed to halt declines of early-seral–associated bird populations, which are still declining. The NWFP’s policy of maintaining early-seral ecosystems is needed to stabilize these populations. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure.

To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice, and automatically adapts to different problems. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data. We also show that the proposed architecture is able to achieve state-of-the-art results for the problem of semantic segmentation of satellite images.

They are also fundamental to the understanding of the emergence of thermodynamics in isolated systems. The entanglement dynamics is a key ingredient in the study of quantum quenches. However, an exact computation of the entanglement dynamics was available so far only for noninteracting systems, whereas it was deemed unfeasible for interacting ones. Here, we show that the standard quasiparticle picture of the entanglement dynamics, complemented with integrability-based knowledge of the steady state and its excitations, leads to a complete understanding of the entanglement dynamics in the space–time scaling limit. We thoroughly check our result for the paradigmatic Heisenberg chain. Our work provides a general framework for the study of the entanglement dynamics in interacting systems. It also provides a new perspective on the entanglement–entropy connection."

However, the evolution of brain information-processing capacity is less understood. We present a comprehensive analysis of neuron numbers in amniotes, which are the group that includes birds and mammals. We show that reptiles have not only small brains relative to body size but also low neuronal densities, resulting in average neuron numbers over 20 times lower than those in birds and mammals of similar body size. Amniote brain evolution is characterized by the following four major shifts in neuron–brain scaling. The most dramatic increases in brain neurons occurred independently with the appearance of birds and mammals, resulting in convergent neuron scaling in the two endothermic lineages. The other two major increases in the number of neurons happened in core land birds and anthropoid primates, which are two groups known for their cognitive prowess. Interestingly, relative brain size is associated with relative neuronal cell density in reptiles, birds, and primates but not in other mammals. This has important implications for studies using relative brain size as a proxy when looking for evolutionary drivers of animal cognition."

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal and transformed cells is more complex than previously appreciated. We have shown that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. Thus, TRAP1 may be a promising target for cancer therapy. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc."

It is known to sever actin filaments, but how it does so is not understood. Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to monitor and quantify the action of ADF in different mechanical situations. We find that ADF binds to actin filaments and displaces actin monomers, thereby depolymerizing the filament. However, we also find that ADF-induced filament depolymerization is enhanced by mechanical stress. A simple model, which faithfully recapitulates our experimental observations, indicates that the ADF-induced mechanical torque enhances the depolymerization rate constant 100-fold. A consequence of this mechanism is that cross-linked filament networks are severed by ADF far more efficiently than nonconnected filaments. We propose that this mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. Our work provides a general mechanism for how mechanical stress can enhance the activity of proteins involved in severing actin filaments. This mechanism may be relevant to many biological processes, including cytokinesis and cell migration. (Continued)"

Admixture and demographic growth happened recently, suggesting a rapid settlement of Madagascar during the last millennium. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, there are geographic influences on the present genomic diversity, independent of the admixture, showing that a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. Our results provide insights into the settlement history of Madagascar. They also highlight the importance of sex-biased admixture and the heterogeneity of the settlement history of Madagascar.

We test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed of Facebook users. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others’ positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.

We demonstrate that RppH decapsulates Np4-capped RNAs by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to decapsulate other RNAs. The unusual manner in which Np4-capped RNAs bind to the active site of RppH positions the δ-phosphate, rather than the β-phosphate, for hydrolytic attack, generating triphosphorylated RNA as the primary product of decapping. The differential impact of RppH on the rates at which capped and uncapped 5′ termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress.

Here, we introduce a dual-FOV high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) for simultaneously profiling aerosol and water cloud properties, especially water cloud microphysical properties. The HSRL was used to conduct continuous observations of aerosols and clouds over Beijing, China, to investigate the interactions between aerosol loading and water cloud microphysical properties. The observations show that increased aerosol loading led to increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius—consistent with expectations—but had no discernible increase on liquid water path. This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations obtained from the HSRL constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI processes. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI. This study provides a new way to observe ACI. (Read more)"

We find that the wispy, wheel-shaped orb web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to capture the sound-induced air particle movements that approach the maximum physical efficiency better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By sensing the motion of web threads, the spider remotely detects and localizes the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave, such as those emitted by approaching prey or predators. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself. The spider also enables the flexibility to functionally adjust and regularly"

We show that it can avoid an excess mortality rate of 3.61 (2.96–4.21) million per year from outdoor air pollution worldwide. This could be up to 5.55 (4.52–6.52) million per year by additionally controlling nonfossil anthropogenic sources. Globally, fossil-fuel-related emissions account for about 65% of the excess mortality, and 70% of the climate cooling by anthropogenic aerosols. The chemical influence of air pollution on aeolian dust contributes to the aerosol cooling. Since aerosols mask the anthropogenic rise in global temperature, removing pollution particles liberates 0.51(±0.03) °C and all particles 0.73(±0.03) °C warming, reaching around 2 °C over North America and Northeast Asia. The steep temperature increase from removing aerosols can be moderated to about 0.36(±0.06) °C globally by the simultaneous reduction of tropospheric ozone and methane.

Antibodies raised against the engineered protein exhibited heterotypic binding to the RBD from two recently reported SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs). Presentation of the engineered RBD on a designed VLP also reduced weight loss in hamsters upon viral challenge. These results support the use of this engineered RBD in a vaccine.

To understand how HKU4 and HKU5 transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4.

We now demonstrate that A. phagocytophilum induces ticks to express antifreeze glycoprotein (iafgp), which encodes a protein with several properties, including the ability to alter bacterial biofilm formation. IAFGP thereby perturbs the tick gut microbiota, which influences the integrity of the peritrophic matrix and gut barrier—critical obstacles for Anaplasma colonization. These data elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which a human pathogen appropriates an arthropod antibacterial protein to alter the gut microbiota and more effectively colonize the vector. The findings have implications for vector-borne disease transmission. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc."

The discovery of a basal pygostylian, Jinguofortis perplexus, increases our understanding of the origin of the short tail in birds. Jinguofortis is the earliest known member of the clade Pygostylia (birds with a short tail ending in a compound bone termed “pygostyle”) and represents the second earliest diverging group of the Pygostylia. The presence of a fused scapulocoracoid in adult individuals independently evolved in Jinguofortisidae and Confuciusornithiformes may relate to an accelerated osteogenesis during chondrogenesis and likely formed through the heterochronic process of peramorphosis by which these basal taxa retain the scapulocoracoid of the nonavian theropod ancestors with the addition of flight-related modifications. The discovery of Jinguofortis increases the known ecomorphological diversity of basal pygostylians and highlights the importance of developmental plasticity for understanding mosaic evolution in early birds. This study also provides insights into the evolution of the flight apparatus and the origin of the avian wing. (Continued"

This comes from analysis of observations showing that stratospheric water vapor increases with tropospheric temperature, implying the existence of a stratospheric water vapor feedback. We estimate the strength of this feedback in a chemistry–climate model to be +0.3 W/(m2⋅K), which would be a significant contributor to the overall climate sensitivity. One-third of this feedback comes from increases in water vapor entering the stratosphere through the tropical tropopause layer, with the rest coming from increases in water vapor entering through the extratropical tropopause. Our results suggest that stratospheric water vapor should be included in climate models. This is important because the stratosphere is currently not well represented in climate models.

One such coloration is blue-green, which is caused by unusually high concentrations of biliverdin, a pigment that is normally found in the blood. We show that the presence of high biliverdin concentrations has evolved multiple times during the evolutionary history of anurans (frogs and toads). We also describe a new mechanism for the evolution of this coloration, which relies on the presence of a class of proteins that bind biliverdin. These proteins are most similar to human antiproteases, but with a remarkable functional diversification. Our results present molecular and functional evidence of recurrent evolution of chlorosis, describe a biliverdin-binding protein in vertebrates, and introduce a function for a member of the serpin superfamily, the largest and most ubiquitous group of protease inhibitors.

Here, we show that HIF-dependent expression of AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5) demethylates NANOG mRNA, which encodes a breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) marker, at an m6A residue in the 3′-UTR. ALKBH5 expression is induced by hypoxia, and hypoxia-induced NANOG expression and the BCSC phenotype are dependent on ALKBH5. ALKBH5 overexpression increases the percentage of BCSCs, and knockdown of ALKBH5 expression decreases the percentage of BCSCs. Thus, HIF-dependent ALKBH5 expression mediates enrichment of BCSCs in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. This study provides a rationale for targeting ALKBH5 for the treatment of breast cancer.

The source of the parchment, often called “uterine vellum,” has been a long-standing controversy in codicology. The Latin term abortivum in many sources has led some scholars to suggest that fetal calves or sheep skins were used. Others have argued that it would not be possible to sustain herds if so many pocket Bibles were made from fetal skins, arguing instead for unexpected alternatives, such as rabbit. Here, we report a simple and objective method using standard conservation treatments to identify the animal origin of parchment. The noninvasive method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals. These results suggest that ultrafine vellum does not necessarily derive from the use of abortive or newborn animals with ultrathin hides, but could equally well reflect a production"

However, recent and predicted future reductions in fire activity may reverse this, enhancing land carbon uptake and corresponding to offsetting ∼5 to 10 y of global CO2 emissions at today’s levels.

We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete. This work provides insight into the evolution of dual"

Here, we introduce a deep learning algorithm that efficiently enhances antibody affinity to achieve broader and more potent neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a human antibody P36-5D2, which is effective against SARS-CoV-2 Alpha, Beta, and Gamma but not Delta. We show that our algorithm can identify CDR changes that alleviate the impact of two Omicron mutations on the epitope. These results highlight the power of our deep learning approach in antibody optimization and its potential application to engineering other protein molecules.

However, their information is often not used in agricultural decision-making. We show that this is because crop experts’ information is not easily accessible and is not used in a way that is compatible with the information provided by other sources. We propose a framework that transforms the original categorical information provided by crop experts into a continuous probabilistic variable that is more compatible with quantitative analysis. We show that this probabilistic variable is robust across different crops, exhibits long-term stability, and has nation-wide validity. We demonstrate how this probabilistic variable can be used to monitor crop status and provide earlier and more precise predictions of crop yields than official USDA forecasts released midseason. Our framework can be used to improve the quality of crop monitoring systems in any country."

Here we propose a computational model of memory in the brain that is based on the adaptive changes in excitability of neurons. We show that this mechanism can support memory on timescales ranging from milliseconds to seconds. This is a fundamentally different approach to memory than the traditional view that relies on elevated firing rates or excitatory feedback. Our results suggest that memory is supported by a form of synaptic facilitation that reduces firing rates. This mechanism is sensitive to context and serial order which makes it suitable for temporal integration in sequence processing within the language domain. Our findings provide a step toward a computational neurobiology of language.

We synthesize the largest global dataset to date of soil respiration, moisture, and temperature measurements, totaling &gt;3,800 observations representing 27 temperature manipulation studies, spanning nine biomes and over 2 decades of warming. Our analysis reveals no significant differences in the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration between control and warmed plots in all biomes, with the exception of deserts and boreal forests. Thus, our data provide limited evidence of acclimation of soil respiration to experimental warming in several major biome types, contrary to the results from multiple single-site studies. Our analysis adds a unique cross-biome perspective on the temperature response of soil respiration, information critical to improving our mechanistic understanding of how soil carbon dynamics change with climatic warming. Our results suggest that soil respiration may be more responsive to warming in colder climates compared with warmer regions. This may have important implications for the global carbon cycle. However, the lack of significant warming effects in many biomes suggests that the magnitude of the response may be limited.

However, the evolutionary history of the plastid genome is not only shaped by the evolutionary history of the host organism, but also by the evolutionary history of the parasite. We present a model of the trajectory of plastid genome evolution during the transition from autotrophy to a nonphotosynthetic parasitic lifestyle. We show that relaxed purifying selection in all plastid genes is linked to obligate parasitism, characterized by the parasite’s dependence on a host to fulfill its life cycle, rather than the loss of photosynthesis. Our findings suggest that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner.

We use a high-resolution large ensemble to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the probability of occurrence of multiyear rainfall deficits in southwestern South Africa. We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% by the year 2100 under an intermediate-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5) and to 80% under a high-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5-8.5). These results highlight the strong sensitivity of the drought risk in SSA to future anthropogenic emissions. Our results also highlight the importance of regional downscaling for drought risk assessment. Our approach can be applied to other regions of the world. Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The discovery of this second quasicrystal, which was made by humans in 1945, provides a unique link between the discovery of the first quasicrystal and the birth of the Manhattan Project.

We found that ASK1 deficiency in microglia/macrophages and astrocytes ameliorated EAE, whereas ASK1 deficiency in T cells and dendritic cells had no significant effects on EAE. ASK1 signaling in microglia/macrophages plays a major role in generating and maintaining disease. Activated astrocytes produce key inflammatory mediators, including CCL2, which further activated and recruited microglia/macrophages, in an astrocytic ASK1-dependent manner. Astrocyte-specific analysis revealed CCL2 expression was higher in the later stage compared with the early stage, suggesting a greater proinflammatory role of astrocytes in the later stage.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

To explain the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in the brain and spinal cord, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

Lower Cretaceous aquatic angiosperms, such as Montsechia, open the possibility that aquatic plants were locally common at a very early stage of angiosperm evolution and that aquatic habitats may have played a major role in the diversification of some early angiosperm lineages.

The most common human parvovirus, B19V, is associated with a number of conditions, such as fifth disease in children and arthritis and arthralgias in adults. The evolutionary history of B19V is poorly understood, and the most recent common ancestor of all B19V has been dated to the early 1800s. Here we present 10 ancient B19V genomes from Eurasia and Greenland that date back to ∼0.5 to ∼6.9 thousand years ago. We find that B19V has been associated with humans for a long time, and that the most recent common ancestor of all B19V is dated to ∼12.6 kya. We also show that the recombination event that formed the most common B19V genotype 2 occurred ∼5.0–6.8 kya.

Chitin is synthesized by the host in the host–immune cell–microbial habitat, where it is released just before dusk and is catabolized by the symbiont only at night. This regulation of the glycan catabolism is required for the maintenance of a healthy symbiosis. We propose that this strategy is widespread in nature and may be used by other hosts to regulate the activities of their associated microbes.

We found that pol II stalling at O2-EtdT and N3-EtdT sites is exacerbated by TFIIS-stimulated proofreading activity. Assessment for the impact of the EtdT lesions on individual fidelity checkpoints provided further mechanistic insights, where the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas the more rigid uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into"

Addition of a potent MEK inhibitor that blocks MAPK signaling brings each oncogene-induced surfaceome back to a common state reflecting the strong dependence of the oncogene on the MAPK pathway to propagate signaling.

However, human activities have greatly increased the spatial and seasonal extent of wildfire in the United States. Human-caused wildfires have become so common that they now account for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. Human-caused wildfires disproportionately occurred where fuel moisture was higher than lightning-caused fires, thereby helping expand the geographic and seasonal niche of wildfire. The expansion of the fire niche has important implications for the economic and ecological costs of wildfire. Actions to reduce the risk of wildfire should be a focus of United States policy."

We connect changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities. Our results also suggest that the physical appearance of neighborhoods may be a useful indicator of the economic and demographic characteristics of those neighborhoods. This may have implications for urban planning and policy."

We estimate that the eclipse phase for ZIKV, the time between cell infection and viral production, is most likely short (∼4 h), the median within-host basic reproductive number R0 is 10.7, the rate of viral production is rapid (&gt;25,000 virions d−1), and the lifetime of an infected cell while producing virus is ∼5 h. We also estimate that the minimum number of virions produced by an infected cell over its lifetime is ∼5,500.

The underlying cause of bleaching is the overheating of zooxanthellae, which leads to their death. However, the consequences of this breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis are poorly understood. Here, we show that the metabolic energy demand of the coral host is increased during heat stress, which is compensated by the degradation of amino acids. The resulting shift from net uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont subsequently promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host. Energy limitation and altered symbiotic nutrient cycling are thus key factors in the early heat stress response, directly contributing to the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis. Our findings provide a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

We show that a unique volcanic eruption series, with a ∼192-y eruption cycle, occurred exactly at the start of accelerated deglaciation. The eruptions led to stratospheric ozone depletion, which plausibly triggered a series of climate changes that extended from the Antarctic Peninsula to the subtropics. The timing of the Mount Takahe eruptions is consistent with a poleward shift in the Southern Hemisphere westerlies, which would have led to a rapid warming of the Southern Hemisphere and a cooling of the Arctic. The coincidence of the Mount Takahe eruptions with the start of accelerated deglaciation supports the hypothesis that the Southern Hemisphere was in a glacial-state climate for a long time before the start of deglaciation.

Using an introgression population derived from S. pennellii, we identified a locus essential for the production of all the detectable nitrogenous volatiles in tomato fruit. Silencing of the underlying gene in transgenic plants abolished production of aliphatic and aromatic nitrogenous volatiles in ripe fruit, and metabolomic analysis of these fruit revealed the accumulation of 2-isobutyl-tetrahydrothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid, a known conjugate of cysteine and 3-methylbutanal. Biosynthetic incorporation of stable isotope-labeled precursors into 2-isobutylthiazole and 2-phenylacetonitrile confirmed that cysteine provides the nitrogen atom for all nitrogenous volatiles in tomato fruit.

However, these threats are frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa.

These results suggest that grid cells might form a distinct network from other cell types. This study provides a powerful method for studying the organization of the MEC.

Instead, FTs are able to function as an important interplant flowering signal, which is able to induce flowering in the parasite. This study illustrates how regressive evolution, commonly found in parasites, may facilitate the physiological synchronization of parasite and host, here allowing the C. australis parasite to time reproduction exactly with that of their hosts, likely optimizing parasite fitness.

The pathophysiology of the disease is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve loss of dopamine-containing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and their replacement by glial cells. Here, we show that the dopamine-containing neurons in the SNc are not the sole source of dopamine in the striatum. Instead, we identify a previously unrecognized system of striatonigral fibers that originate in striosomes, a subregion of the SNc, and arborize in clusters around dopamine-containing dendrites in the SNc. These clusters are termed “striosome–dendron bouquets.” The striosome–dendron bouquets likely represent specialized integrative units within the dopamine-containing nigral system. Given evidence that striosomes receive input from cortical regions related to the control of mood and motivation and that they link functionally to reinforcement and decision-making, the striosome–dendron bouquets could be critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease. Thus, the striosome–dendron bouquets may be important to understanding the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease. This work"

But how do we know when two people are connected? We asked pairs of friends and strangers to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Finally, we demonstrate that this signal is used by third-party listeners as a heuristic of how well people are connected: Conversations with faster response times were perceived as more connected than the same conversations with slower response times. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

We found that the 6 largest of 235 tributaries accounted for ∼70% of the daily N and P delivered to Lake Michigan. However, small watersheds exhibited nutrient loads that were high for their size and biased toward dissolved inorganic forms. Higher bioavailability of nutrients from small watersheds suggests greater potential to fuel algal blooms in coastal areas.

We found that deforestation led to a reduction in fruit and vegetable consumption and thus vitamin A adequacy of diets. This study has important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. Our findings suggest that strategies to improve nutrition should consider the role of natural landscapes such as forests in meeting nutrition goals. This study also highlights the importance of using causal inference methods to understand the effects of deforestation on people’s diets. This is a relatively new field of research, and we hope that our study will encourage others to use this approach to understand the effects of deforestation on people’s diets and other aspects of their livelihoods."

We show that the increase in mechanization has led to a global expansion of subsoil compaction risk, with 20% of arable land now at risk of subsoil compaction. We also show that the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods. This suggests that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, highlighting the need for ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails. Our results have implications for the design of farm machinery and the management of agricultural practices. They also suggest that the expansion of agriculture may have had a negative impact on the environment of the past."
