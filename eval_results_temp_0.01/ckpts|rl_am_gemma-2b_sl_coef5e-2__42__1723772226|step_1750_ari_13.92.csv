Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1, but the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1 is not completely understood. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1.

Notably, the best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. The results of this study provide a valuable resource for the development of new antibiotics. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The proposed architecture is based on a simple idea: use dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connect all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data. We believe that the proposed architecture will be useful for many image-processing problems in the future."

The strongest genetic risk factor influencing susceptibility to AD is the APOE genotype. APOE is a protein that is produced by astrocytes, a type of glial cell that is highly phagocytic. We found that APOE isoform regulates the rate of astrocytic phagocytosis of synapses, which are the cellular units of cognition. APOE2 enhances the rate of phagocytosis of synapses by astrocytes, whereas APO4 decreases it. We also found that APOE4 increases the rate of C1q accumulation in astrocytes, which may represent the accumulation of senescent synapses with enhanced vulnerability to complement-mediated degeneration. These studies reveal a novel role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes. They also suggest the hypothesis that AD susceptibility of APOE4 may originate in part from defective phagocytic capacity of astrocytes which accelerates the rate of accumulation of C1q-coated senescent synapses, enhancing synaptic vulnerability to classical-complement-cascade mediated neurodegeneration."

In this work, we show that the most common mRNA modification, pseudouridine (Ψ), can have a modest effect on translation. We find that the presence of Ψ in the ribosome–mRNA complex can increase the rate of translation of some codons, and that the presence of Ψ in coding regions can modestly alter both translation speed and mRNA decoding. These findings suggest that mRNA modifications can have subtle effects on translation, and that the ribosome can encounter Ψ in the course of decoding mRNAs. Our results have implications for understanding the effects of mRNA modifications on translation and for the design of therapeutic drugs that target protein synthesis. (Show more)"

Moreover, we identify an inflammatory profile unique to Aβ-burdened neurons, since neighboring glial cells did not express similar molecules.

However, this description is not supported by neurophysiological data. Here, we show that the brain’s activity increases with each successive word in a sentence but decreases when words are merged into phrases. This pattern of activity is consistent with a neural implementation of a merge operation, which applies equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases. This model of language processing may be important for understanding the brain’s processing of other complex sequences, such as speech and music."

The auditory organs of these animals are extremely diverse in anatomy after hundreds of millions of years of evolution, yet they are all made up of cellular tissue and are morphologically part of the body. Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. We find that the wispy, wheel-shaped orb web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to capture the sound-induced air particle movements that approach the maximum physical efficiency better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By sensing the motion of web threads, the spider remotely detects and localizes the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave, such as those emitted by approaching prey or predators. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. Our study provides a mechanistic understanding of the role of forgetting in autism and may facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies. This article is protected by copyright.

Rather, the inclusion bodies in ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

We show that the provision of a single glycan, chitin, by the host to its symbiont, Vibrio fischeri, is critical for the maintenance of the mutualism between the two organisms. This glycan is consumed by the symbiont only at night, when the animal is active, and is required for the periodic acidification of the symbiotic crypts, which enhances the production of bioluminescence. This glycan-driven regulation of the symbiont’s habitat may be a common mechanism for the control of the activities of symbionts in the animal kingdom."

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis remain unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We found that the three regioisomeric EtdT lesions have distinct effects on the fidelity checkpoints and transcriptional lesion bypass routes. The results from the present in vitro transcriptional studies are well correlated with in vivo transcriptional mutagenesis analysis. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop). The Pro-Gate loop faces toward the minor groove of RNA:DNA hybrid and is involved in modulating the translocation of minor-groove alkylated DNA template after nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion. Taken together, this work provides important mechanistic insights into transcriptional stalling, lesion bypass, and mutagenesis of alkylated DNA lesions. This article is protected by copyright.

Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change.

Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection.

Certification is the main tool used to fulfill these commitments, and the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) is the leading certification body. We show that certification is associated with a 33% reduction in deforestation in oil palm plantations, but that the benefits are limited to areas that are already degraded and contain little residual forest. Certification has no causal impact on active fire detection rates or peatland deforestation. Our results suggest that certification is unlikely to meet its stated goals of reducing deforestation in the palm oil sector."

The exocytosis process is tightly regulated, and the dysfunction of the exocytosis process is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. We discovered a small molecule that inhibits the exocytosis process in plants and humans. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

One is the photochemical oxidation of the pigment molecule, A2E, which leads to the formation of a large number of reactive intermediates. The other is the oxidation of the vitamin A aldehyde adducts, which are formed by photochemical oxidation of vitamin A and its derivatives. We show that the intracellular levels of iron, which are known to be important for redox reactions, impact the oxidation and degradation of A2E and bisretinoids. These findings have implications for the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in the elderly. (Read more)"

However, the origin of the distinctive human hand morphology is poorly understood because of the paucity of hand fossils in the hominin fossil record between 800,000 and 1.8 My old. Here we show that the third metacarpal styloid process, a key derived feature of the modern human hand, was present ∼1.42 My old in a fossil from Kenya. This fossil thus provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key shared derived characteristic of modern human and Neandertal hand morphology and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo. This study also provides a new perspective on the evolution of the human hand and the origins of modern human behavior. (Less)"

We have developed a small-molecule inhibitor of the one-carbon metabolism enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), and used it to identify a metabolic vulnerability of cancer cells. We show that the one-carbon donor, formate, rescues SHMT inhibition in cancer cells, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in a subset of cancer cells. We also show that cancer cells have defective glycine import, and that this is a targetable metabolic deficiency of cancer. Thus, we have identified a metabolic vulnerability of cancer, and a targetable metabolic deficiency of cancer."

This study shows that deforestation in rural Tanzania led to a reduction in people’s fruit and vegetable consumption and thus vitamin A adequacy of diets. Conversely, forest fragmentation led to an increase in fruit and vegetable consumption and dietary vitamin A adequacy. These findings have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. This study also highlights the importance of using a causal modeling approach to understand the effects of environmental change on people’s diets. This approach can be used to understand the effects of other environmental changes in the future."

However, the weight of farm machinery has increased at a faster rate than the weight of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods. We show that the weight of modern farm vehicles is now approaching that of the largest sauropods, and that the increase in weight has led to a chronic subsoil compaction risk, with potential loss of productivity. We hypothesize that the roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the largest sauropods, the brachiosaurs, had a fixed foraging trail. Our results have important implications for the history of agriculture and for the evolution of animal behavior. They also suggest that the history of farming may be intertwined with the history of the environment."
