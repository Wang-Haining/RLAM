In this work, we report the synthesis and structure of a hydrate of neon in ice II. The structure of the hydrate is determined by neutron diffraction. The guest atoms are enclathrated in water molecules to form ice II-structured hydrates. The guest atoms have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The resolved structure is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. The density distributions indicate that the vibration of guest atoms is mainly in planes perpendicular to water channels, whereas their distributions along the channels are further constrained by interactions between adjacent guest atoms. The results provide insights into the structure of ice II and the properties of water. This work also provides a new route to study the structure of ice II and the properties of water.

In this paper, we provide a purely categorical approach to the foundations of quantum theory. The axioms are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. This addresses a question about the mathematical foundations of quantum theory raised in reconstruction programs such as those of von Neumann, Mackey, Jauch, Piron, Abramsky, and Coecke. The axioms are also consistent with the standard mathematical theory of Hilbert spaces. We believe that this work provides a significant step toward a mathematical foundation for quantum theory."

Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we compare the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Less)"

The SARS-CoV-2 virus is able to evade the host immune response by blocking the nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, which are key factors in the activation of the IFN pathway. In this study, we show that the viral accessory protein Orf6 is responsible for this evasion mechanism. We found that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1, which is a key factor in the nuclear import of STAT1 and STAT2. We also show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the host immune response and may lead to the development of new strategies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the male reproductive system, sperm cells are quiescent due to the inhibition of proton channels by zinc, but become active once introduced into the female reproductive tract, where zinc is low. How zinc inhibits proton channels is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of zinc inhibition of proton channels. We find that zinc binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the zinc-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how zinc inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large herbivores in semiarid African savanna. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers. Grass consumption inferred from mean sequence relative read abundance ranged from &gt;99% (plains zebra) to &lt;1% (dik-dik). Grass RRA was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of % grass consumption, indicating that RRA conveys reliable quantitative information about consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This study demonstrates the power of DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth"

We identified an important mediating role for mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens. High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate exhibit reduced mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens and are unable to produce ATP and ROS at the same level as low-anxious animals. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals. Our findings highlight a key role for brain energy metabolism in social behavior and point to mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens as a potential marker and avenue of treatment for anxiety-related social disorders.

The treatment of hypertension is the cornerstone of the treatment of heart failure. The most commonly used drugs for treating hypertension are the L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs). However, the use of LCCBs is associated with the development of heart failure. Here, we show that LCCBs activate Ca2+ signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which is associated with the up-regulation of the Ca2+ sensor protein STIM1. Our data indicate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of plasma membrane Ca2+ channels. Our findings may help to understand the mechanism of LCCBs action and may lead to the development of new strategies for the treatment of heart failure. (Show more)"

We also show that the early-seral ecosystem area was stable, but declined in two ecoregions—the Coast Range and Cascades—along with early-seral bird populations. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure. Our results also highlight the need for a more holistic approach to forest management that considers the full range of ecosystem services and values. This is particularly important in the context of climate change, where the role of forests in climate regulation and carbon sequestration is increasingly recognized."

Computational approaches are essential tools to this end since their application enables fast and early strategical decisions in the drug development process. Here, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations.

The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice, and automatically adapts to different problems. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data. We also show that the proposed architecture is able to achieve state-of-the-art results for the problem of semantic segmentation of satellite images.

Phylogenomic analyses of these uniquely comprehensive datasets resolved previously controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, both major independent origins of specialized herbivory in beetles coincide with the first appearances of an arsenal of PCWDEs encoded in their genomes. Beetle diversity thus appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding PCW"

We also found that APOE is important for the accumulation of a protein that is a marker of senescent synapses in the brain. These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes.

Specifically, compared with controls, marijuana abusers had significantly attenuated brain DA responses to methylphenidate. In ventral striatum (key brain reward region), methylphenidate-induced reductions in DA responses were inversely correlated with addiction severity and craving. The attenuated responses to methylphenidate, including reduced decreases in striatal DA, are consistent with decreased brain reactivity to the DA stimulation in marijuana abusers that might contribute to their negative emotionality and addictive behaviors.

Here we show that TRAP1 is a critical regulator of the metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This study provides a molecular basis for the role of TRAP1 in cancer and suggests that TRAP1 may be a promising target for cancer therapy. (Read more)"

They are dynamic polymers that can be assembled and disassembled. The actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin family is the major regulator of actin filament disassembly. It is a key player in many cellular processes, including cell migration, cell division, and cytokinesis. However, how it does so in a physiological context, where filaments are interconnected and under mechanical stress, remains unclear. Here, we show that ADF/cofilin can sever actin filaments in a mechanical context. We find that filament curvature favors severing, while tension has no effect on cofilin binding and weakly enhances severing. We also find that filament segments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist, experience a mechanical torque upon cofilin binding. We propose that this ADF/cofilin-induced torque increases the severing rate constant 100-fold. A consequence of this mechanism is that cross-linked filament networks are severed far more efficiently than nonconnected filaments. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. We believe that our findings will help us understand"

The vast majority of Ψ moieties in mRNAs are found in coding regions, and our study suggests that one consequence of the ribosome encountering Ψ can be to modestly alter both translation speed and mRNA decoding.

Here we demonstrate that the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses the mechanical activity of its surface adhesin type IV pili to detect contact with surfaces. This mechanosensory system is mediated by the Chp chemosensory system, a chemotaxis-like system that regulates the production of the second messenger cAMP and transcription of hundreds of genes, including key virulence factors. The methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein-like chemosensor PilJ directly interacts with the major pilin subunit PilA. Our results thus support a mechanochemical model where a chemosensory system measures the mechanically induced conformational changes in stretched type IV pili. These findings demonstrate that P. aeruginosa not only uses type IV pili for surface-specific twitching motility, but also as a sensor regulating surface-induced gene expression and pathogenicity. This mechanochemical model of surface sensing may be relevant to other bacteria and may have implications for the development of new strategies for controlling bacterial infections.

The temperature of the surface is important because it is the temperature at which life on Earth exists. The temperature of the surface is also important because it is the temperature at which the chemical reactions that sustain life occur. This study uses a method that has not been used before to determine the temperature of the surface of the Earth in the past. The method is based on the thermostability of enzymes that are used in the chemical reactions that sustain life. The results of this study are consistent with the temperature of the surface of the Earth decreasing over geological time.

They are also the main targets of drugs. Ion channels are activated by opening their pore gates and inactivated by closing their pore gates. The pore gates are located at the intracellular end of the channel and the selectivity filter. The pore gates are the main targets of drugs. We found that the pore gates of the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel are spatially overlapped or colocalized with the selectivity filter’s C-type inactivation gate. The BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and its rates and extents inversely correlate with channel-open probability. The BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation.

Future work should examine the relationship between HM and men’s and women’s endorsement of other forms of patriarchal dominance, such as patriarchy-promoting religious beliefs."

Our results indicate that these women had a very high genetic heterogeneity, including signals of ancestry from western Europe to East Asia. In addition, we found that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago.

We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4.

However, the role of RORα in the intestinal epithelium is still unclear. Here, we generated intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific RORα-deficient mice and found that RORα is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis by attenuating nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcriptional activity. RORαΔIEC mice exhibit excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis reveals corecruitment of RORα and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) on NF-κB target promoters and subsequent dismissal of CREB binding protein (CBP) and bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) for transcriptional repression.

We show that the glycan is provided only at night, when the squid is in the dark phase, and that it is required for the persistence of the symbiont. This glycan is catabolized by the symbiont, which is able to acidify the crypts where the symbiont lives, thereby enhancing its capacity to produce bioluminescence. This work suggests that the provision of specific nutrients may be a common mechanism for regulating the activities of the gut microbiota in animals.

There is an urgent need for novel and more efficient therapies, ideally targeting AML stem cells that are essential for maintaining the disease. Here, we show that monoclonal antibodies targeting the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This study provides a proof of principle for the use of antibody-based therapies in AML. This approach could be extended to other"

We found that the RNA also interacts with two other enzymes and that the interaction with glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is required for the RNA to repress carbon utilization genes.

Our findings suggest that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner.

We use a high-resolution large ensemble to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the probability of occurrence of multiyear rainfall deficits in southwestern South Africa. We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the probability of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% by the year 2100 under an intermediate-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5) and to 80% under a high-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5-8.5).

The etiology of autism is so complicated because it involves the effects of variants of several hundred risk genes along with the contribution of environmental factors. Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. As an alternative approach, extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying the convergence of the targets and functions of the autism-risk genes to facilitate mapping out causal paths. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. Mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a new"

We demonstrate that the release of aggregates requires N-ethylmalemide–sensitive fusion protein 1, indicating that active release and uptake of aggregates are important elements of spreading and disease progression.

Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions in the brain and spinal cord are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. To explain the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in the brain and spinal cord, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

CRF acts on the cerebral cortex via its receptor CRFR1, which triggers signaling of cAMP/PKA in astrocytes, leading to activation of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and cerebral edema. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying cerebral edema and may lead to the development of new therapies for this condition. (Show more)"

Here, we demonstrate that ets variant 2 (ETV2) alone can directly convert primary human adult skin fibroblasts into functional vascular endothelial cells (ETVECs). In coordination with endogenous FOXC2 in fibroblasts, transduced ETV2 elicits expression of multiple key endothelial development factors, including FLI1, ERG, and TAL1, and induces expression of endothelial functional molecules, including EGFL7 and von Willebrand factor. Consequently, ETVECs exhibits EC characteristics in vitro and forms mature functional vasculature in Matrigel plugs transplanted in mice.

We show that humans have vastly expanded the spatial and seasonal “fire niche” in the United States, accounting for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. Human-caused wildfires disproportionally occurred where fuel moisture was higher than lightning-started fires, thereby helping expand the geographic and seasonal niche of wildfire.

However, they are under threat from a variety of environmental stressors, including climate change. In this study, we show that the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis is a direct consequence of the altered nutrient cycling during heat stress. This process is driven by the increased metabolic energy demand of the coral host, which is compensated by the catabolism of amino acids. The resulting shift from net uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont subsequently promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host.

Network deactivation was observed in healthy subjects and early Parkinson’s disease patients, and this abnormality was partially corrected by dopaminergic therapy. Time-course comparisons of DMN loss in longitudinal resting metabolic scans from Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease patients illustrated that significant reductions appeared later for Parkinson’s disease, in parallel with the development of cognitive dysfunction. In contrast, in Alzheimer’s disease significant reductions in network expression were already present at diagnosis, progressing over time. Metabolic imaging can directly provide useful information regarding the resting organization of the brain in health and disease."

It is required for efficient translation and is the target of many antiviral proteins. Here we show that yeast cells contain a second 5′ modification, the nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) group. We find that NAD-mRNA is found on subsets of nuclear and mitochondrial encoded mRNAs. NAD-mRNA appears to be produced cotranscriptionally because NAD-RNA is also found on pre-mRNAs, and only on mitochondrial transcripts that are not 5′ end processed. This finding suggests that NAD-RNA could modulate mRNA stability and translation on specific subclasses of mRNAs. The discovery of NAD-RNA in yeast opens the possibility that this modification is widespread in eukaryotes."

FSIP1 deficiency promotes autophagy, enhances AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreases mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity.

However, these two factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result is driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. First, more diverse communities have a greater chance of including species with thermal traits that enable them to maintain productivity as temperatures shift from ambient conditions. Second, we found a pronounced increase in the contribution of complementarity to the net biodiversity effect at high and low temperatures, indicating that changes in species interactions played a critical role in mediating the impacts of temperature change on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. This is a key finding for understanding the impacts of climate change on the functioning of ecosystems."

But how do we know when two people are connected? We asked pairs of friends and strangers to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Finally, we demonstrate that this signal is used by third-party listeners as a heuristic of how well people are connected: Conversations with faster response times were perceived as more connected than the same conversations with slower response times. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

We show that the intracellular level of iron impacts the retina. In mice treated with the iron chelator deferiprone, the levels of iron in the retina were reduced, and the levels of bisretinoids were elevated. In contrast, mice with increased levels of iron in retinal pigment epithelial cells exhibited reduced levels of bisretinoids. These findings suggest that iron levels impact the retina and that the levels of iron in the retina may be important in the regulation of bisretinoid levels. This work provides a foundation for future studies on the role of iron in the retina. (Read more)"

This is a remarkable specialization, and one that has been considered a dead end for evolutionary change. Here we show that siphonophores are highly specialized, and that they can evolve into generalists. We also show that the evolution of siphonophore tentilla is strongly linked to prey type, and that this is associated with the evolution of the tentilla and nematocysts. These findings contribute to understanding how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs. They also help build a broader perspective on predatory niche diversification via morphological innovation and evolution."

This study provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key derived feature of the human hand, the third metacarpal styloid process. This fossil provides the earliest evidence for the evolution of a key derived characteristic of the modern human hand and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo. This study also provides a new perspective on the evolution of the human hand in the context of the broader hominin fossil record. The discovery of this fossil is the result of a collaborative effort between the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa, and the University of Tübingen, Germany.

We have developed a small-molecule inhibitor of the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), which converts serine into glycine and a tetrahydrofolate-bound one-carbon unit. We show that this inhibitor is effective in vitro and in vivo, and that it is particularly effective in B-cell lines. We also show that the one-carbon donor formate is a potent rescue of SHMT inhibition in cancer cells, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of DLBCL. This work provides a rationale for the use of SHMT inhibitors in the treatment of cancer, and a rationale for the use of glycine import inhibitors in the treatment of DLBCL. It also provides a framework for the design of new small-molecule inhibitors of SHMT. This work is relevant to the field because it provides a rationale for the use of SHMT inhibitors in the treatment of cancer, and a rationale for the use of glycine import inhibitors in the treatment of DLBCL. It also provides a framework for the design"

In this study, we show that deforestation is having a negative impact on people’s diets in rural Tanzania. We found that deforestation led to a reduction in fruit and vegetable consumption and thus vitamin A adequacy of diets. Conversely, we found that forest fragmentation led to an increase in fruit and vegetable consumption and dietary vitamin A adequacy. This study has important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. We hope that this study will encourage policy makers to consider the role of forests in improving people’s diets and nutrition security. (Less)"

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis calls for a rethinking of the role of sauropods"
