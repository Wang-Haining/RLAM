The structure of hydrate is also important for the development of hydrate-based carbon dioxide storage technology. In this work, we report the structure of hydrate formed by neon, a gas that is not normally considered to be a hydrate-forming gas. The structure of neon hydrate is different from that of other hydrate-forming gases, such as methane and carbon dioxide. This work provides a new perspective on the structure of hydrate and its formation mechanism. It also provides a new method for the formation of hydrate with a different gas. This method can be used to study the structure of hydrate and its formation mechanism. It can also be used to store carbon dioxide in the deep ocean."

Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we present the first genome assemblies for two species of myxozoans, which represent the sister group to the Myxozoa, and compare these to the genome of a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Less)"

The SARS-CoV-2 virus is able to evade the host immune response by blocking the nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are essential for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). In this study, we show that the viral accessory protein Orf6 is responsible for this anti-IFN activity. We found that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and interacts with Nup98-Rae1, a protein complex that mediates nuclear import. We also show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its anti-IFN activity. Our findings provide a mechanism of viral antagonism that could be used by other pathogens to evade the antiviral action of IFN.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

We find that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields will increase almost everywhere, and the probability that they have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year will increase. These results highlight the need for investments in breeding for heat tolerance. They also underscore the urgency of these investments, as the world will need to increase maize production by 50% by 2050 to meet the needs of a growing population."

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammal species in semiarid African savanna. We found that species differed in their diets, even when they were matched in body size and digestive physiology. These differences were reflected in high dietary overlap between species that were similar in diet composition, but not in diet breadth. Our results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore communities. Our findings also highlight the importance of plant diversity in structuring large herbivore communities.

This is due to the size-selective sinks of plastic debris on the open ocean surface, which involve a combination of processes that are still to be identified.

Here, we show that these mutations protect cancer cells from ferroptosis by activating the mTOR signaling axis, which in turn induces sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. We also show that SREBP1 mediates the ferroptosis-suppressing activity of SREBP1 by producing monounsaturated fatty acids. Finally, we demonstrate that the combination of mTOR inhibition with ferroptosis induction is effective in preclinical models of cancer with PI3K or PTEN mutations. These findings suggest that mTOR inhibition may be combined with ferroptosis induction to treat cancer patients with PI3K or PTEN mutations. (PsycINFO Database Record"

The most common treatment for hypertension is the use of drugs that block the voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channel (Cav1.2). However, these drugs are associated with a higher risk of heart failure. Here, we show that these drugs promote vascular remodeling through a mechanism involving the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stromal-interacting molecule (STIM) Ca2+ sensor. Our findings indicate that the use of these drugs should be carefully considered in patients with advanced hypertension or cardiovascular remodeling. This study provides a mechanism for the adverse effects of these drugs and may lead to the development of new drugs for the treatment of hypertension. This article is protected by copyright.

We also show that the early-seral ecosystem area was stable, but declined in two ecoregions—the Coast Range and Cascades—along with early-seral bird populations. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure.

We show that the best compounds designed by us are active against antibiotic-resistant pathogens, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin. The compounds are more soluble, exhibit higher binding affinity to the ribosome, and are up to 56 times more active than telithromycin. The design strategy can be extended to other antibiotic classes. This work is expected to contribute to the development of new antibiotics to combat antibiotic resistance.

Our analyses resolved previously controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, corresponding (Jurassic) diversification rate increases suggest that these novel genes triggered adaptive radiations that resulted in nearly half of all living beetle species.

We also found that APOE4 increases the rate of C1q accumulation in the brain, which may represent the accumulation of senescent synapses with enhanced vulnerability to complement-mediated neurodegeneration. These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes. They also suggest the hypothesis that AD susceptibility of APOE4 may originate in part from defective phagocytic capacity of astrocytes which accelerates the rate of accumulation of C1q-coated senescent synapses, enhancing synaptic vulnerability to classical-complement-cascade mediated neurodegeneration.

This suggests that the mechanisms that drive language comprehension are similar in humans and artificial neural networks. We also find that the networks’ neural fits are predictive of how well they perform on a language task. These results provide computational evidence that predictive processing fundamentally shapes the language comprehension mechanisms in the human brain.

Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to study the action of ADF in different mechanical situations. We find that ADF binds to filaments and induces severing in a mechanical torque-dependent manner. This mechanism is critical for ADF to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for how ADF, a small protein, can regulate the dynamics of actin filaments, which are the major cytoskeletal filament network in cells. Our findings also suggest that the mechanical state of the filament network may be an important determinant of the dynamics of the filament network."

These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks.

Here, we demonstrate that neurons are also capable of producing potent inflammatory factors, which are released into the extracellular environment and may trigger the immune response. We show that the accumulation of soluble Aβ species within the brain is sufficient to trigger a neuron-specific inflammatory response, which may precede the formation of Aβ plaques and tau tangles. These findings provide a mechanism for the development of the earliest AD-related immune response, and may help to explain the lack of inflammation in the brains of the earliest AD-affected individuals. This may also explain the failure of current treatments to halt the progression of the disease.

The antifungal activity of the peptide is unique in that it is not mediated by the classical mode of action of antifungal peptides, i.e., by binding to the fungal cell wall. Instead, the peptide binds to bioactive phosphoinositides in the fungal cell, which leads to disruption of the plasma membrane and subsequent cell death.

This work also provides a proof of concept that a small peptide can be used to protect plants against fungal pathogens. This work opens up a new avenue for the development of small peptides as a spray-on fungistat/fungicide. This is an important step toward the development of sustainable agriculture."

However, the extent of molecular continuity between males and females is largely unknown. Here, we use proteomics to characterize the posttesticular life history of the Drosophila sperm proteome and determine the extent of molecular continuity between males and females. We show that the male–female interface is a dynamic one, and that female contributions support sperm viability during the prolonged period between copulation and fertilization. Our research provides a comprehensive characterization of sperm proteome dynamics and expands our understanding of the critical process of sperm–FRT interactions. This work will be of interest to the broader scientific community and to the public interested in the reproductive system."

We show that the A1 domain of VWF can be switched to a second state with faster binding kinetics by force, which is a relevant force in the context of bleeding. This mechanism provides a mechanism for the pathophysiology of VWD mutations. The mechanism is also relevant to the mechanism of action of some drugs that increase the binding of VWF to platelets.

However, it is difficult to be well represented in climate models due to the complexity of the process. Observations of ACI are challenging because of the lack of simultaneous observations of aerosols and clouds. Here, we introduce a new instrument, the dual-field-of-view high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL), which can simultaneously measure aerosols and clouds. We demonstrate the capability of this instrument to investigate ACI. The observations show that aerosol loading has no discernible effect on liquid water path but increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius. This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations obtained from the dual-FOV HSRL constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI. This paper is expected to be a significant contribution to the ACI community."

The temperature of the surface is important because it is the temperature at which life on Earth is most likely to exist. The temperature of the surface is also important because it is the temperature at which enzymes function. The temperature of the surface is therefore important because it is the temperature at which life functions. This paper presents a method for determining the temperature of the surface of the Earth in the past. The method is based on the thermostability of enzymes reconstructed from ancient DNA. The results of this study suggest that the temperature of the surface of the Earth has decreased over geological time. This finding is consistent with other lines of evidence and suggests that the temperature of the surface of the Earth has been decreasing over geological time.

They are also involved in a variety of diseases, including cardiac arrhythmia. Ion channels are composed of protein subunits that form a pore through which ions can flow. The pore is controlled by two gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. We found that the BK channel lacks an intracellular activation gate and normally shows no C-type inactivation. We also found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. Our findings may help us understand the normal function and diseases of ion channels. They may also provide a new approach for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmia.

The parasite uses a number of adhesins to bind to the RBC surface, but the function of this interaction is unknown. Here, we show that the binding of the malaria parasite erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 (EBA175) to glycophorin A (GPA) on the RBC surface leads to a change in the biophysical properties of the RBC. Specifically, we show that EBA175 binding to GPA leads to an increase in the cytoskeletal tension and a reduction in the bending modulus of the RBC membrane. These changes in the RBC are correlated with parasite invasion efficiency. This finding suggests that the malaria parasite primes the RBC surface through its binding antigens, altering the biophysical nature of the target cell and thus reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion. This is a major change in our concept of malaria parasite invasion, suggesting it is, in fact, a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces working together to facilitate entry. This work provides a new perspective on the invasion process and opens up new avenues for the development of antimalarial strategies."

In temperate regions, seasonal outbreaks correlate with decreases in ambient humidity. While low humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes them more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the impact of low humidity on influenza virus infection and disease outcome. They also suggest that low humidity may be a modifiable risk factor for influenza virus infection. This may be particularly important in the context of climate change. (PsycINFO Database Record"

However, whether and how the brain builds such structures remains largely unknown. Here, we used intracranial recordings to investigate how the brain’s activity varies during the formation of phrase structures. We found that high-gamma power increased with each successive word in a sentence but decreased suddenly whenever words could be merged into a phrase. This merge operation was applied equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity, providing evidence for a merge operation that applies equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity. More superficial models of language, based solely on sequential transition probability over lexical and syntactic categories, only captured activity in the posterior middle temporal gyrus. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases.

These results highlight the potential of grasslands to sequester carbon and provide a valuable opportunity to mitigate climate change while maintaining the productivity of agricultural lands. This study also highlights the importance of long-term field experiments in assessing the effects of management on soil carbon storage. This approach is critical to understanding the role of agricultural lands in climate change mitigation and to developing strategies for sustainable agricultural production."

The color of nectar is often used as an indicator of the type of pollinator attracted to the plant. Here, we show that the red color of the nectar of Nesocodon mauritianus is derived from a previously undescribed alkaloid, nesocodin. We demonstrate that this compound is attractive to the vertebrate pollinator, Phelsuma geckos, and that this trait is likely to be favored by selection. This work provides evidence that the red color of nectar is a widespread and convergently evolved trait in nectar-feeding vertebrates. This finding suggests that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation.

Our data indicate that the genetic ancestry of men from this period is similar to that of modern northern and central Europeans, while women exhibit a very high genetic heterogeneity, including signals of genetic ancestry ranging from western Europe to East Asia. This heterogeneity is also reflected in the collective genetic ancestry of the group of women with artificial skull deformations, who had a genetic origin in southeastern Europe.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions.

Our results indicate that the pol δ holoenzyme is loosely associated with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This work provides a unique perspective on the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme and the mechanisms that regulate its activity during DNA replication.

In the laboratory, RNA molecules can be used to direct the activity of ribozymes, but it has not been possible to use ribozymes to synthesize functional RNA molecules. Here, we describe the development of an RNA polymerase ribozyme that can synthesize a variety of functional RNA molecules, including aptamers, ribozymes, and tRNA. This RNA polymerase ribozyme can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins.

The age model presented here is based on the precise dating of volcanic ash beds that mark the Permian-Triassic boundary. The age model is consistent with the carbon cycle perturbation and provides a precise time point for evaluating the plausibility of trigger and kill mechanisms. The age model will also be critical for evaluating the timing of ecosystem recovery."

We also find that the probability of drought years is more than doubled if precipitation deficits occur when conditions are warm. These findings suggest that anthropogenic warming has increased the probability of co-occurring warm and dry conditions in California. This conclusion is supported by a large ensemble of climate model experiments, which shows that human activities have increased the probability of warm–dry conditions.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility, which resulted from the inability to forget. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral phenotypes of autism-risk genes and their convergent functions. It also provides a framework for the identification of the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms. This study will be useful for the development of a mechanistic understanding of autism and for the development of therapeutic strategies for autism. This article is protected by copyright.

In these diseases, the spread of aggregates is thought to be a major contributor to the progressive loss of neurons in the brain. Here we use a fluorescently tagged polyglutamine-expanded form of human huntingtin to study the spread of aggregates in a model of Huntington’s disease. We show that aggregates accumulate at synaptic terminals and spread throughout the brain, where they are internalized and accumulate within other neurons. We also show that the spread of aggregates is non–cell-autonomous and that the loss of vulnerable neurons can be prevented by inhibiting endocytosis in these neurons. Finally, we show that the release of aggregates requires N-ethylmalemide–sensitive fusion protein 1, demonstrating that active release and uptake of aggregates are important elements of spreading and disease progression.

Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions in ALS are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. Instead, we observe that the inclusion bodies in ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

We find that each oncogene has somewhat different surfaceomes, but the functions of these proteins are harmonized by common biological themes including up-regulation of nutrient transporters, down-regulation of adhesion molecules and tumor suppressing phosphatases, and alteration in immune modulators. These studies provide a broad systems-level view of how specific driver oncogenes remodel the surfaceome and the glycoproteome in a cell autologous fashion, and suggest possible surface targets, and combinations thereof, for drug and biomarker discovery.

We find that vote-by-mail does not appear to affect either party’s share of turnout, does not appear to increase either party’s vote share, and modestly increases overall turnout rates. These findings support the conventional wisdom of election administration experts and contradict many popular claims in the media.

This shift from net uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont subsequently promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host.

The distribution of hotspots is similar to that observed in yeast and in mice, suggesting that the general pattern of recombination initiation in flowering plants may be conserved across eukaryotic evolution."

Here we show that epigenetic DNA methylation alterations at specific loci in blood cells from people with diabetes are associated with glycemia for several years during the follow-up of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT). These epigenetic alterations are also associated with metabolic memory. These results support an epigenetic explanation for metabolic memory. They also suggest that epigenetic alterations at specific loci may be used as biomarkers of metabolic memory. This may help to identify people with diabetes who are likely to benefit from intensive therapy. This would be of great importance for the prevention of microvascular complications.

TNBC is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer and has a poor prognosis. Fibrous sheath interacting protein 1 (FSIP1) is a cancer antigen expressed in the majority of TNBC tissues and is associated with poor prognosis. However, the role of FSIP1 in the progression and drug sensitivity of TNBC has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. This article is protected by copyright.

However, these factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we use high-throughput experiments to investigate how changes in temperature affect the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We found that changes in temperature systematically altered the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures departed from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increased, meaning that more species were required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. Our findings have important implications for our ability to predict the impacts of climate change on ecosystem functioning. They also highlight the need to consider the potential for synergistic effects of biodiversity loss and environmental warming on ecosystem functioning.

We asked people to talk with each other and rated their felt connection. We found that the speed at which people responded to each other was a robust predictor of felt connection. People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

It is therefore more efficient and less energy consuming than alternative proposals. This work provides a step toward a computational neurobiology of language.

Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results highlight the importance of certification in forested regions and the need for certification to be tightly linked to the effective conservation of biodiversity and climate change mitigation. These findings are important for the future of sustainability certification in the palm oil sector and beyond."

In many vertebrates, sex is determined by a single locus, resulting in two sexes and two sexes only. However, in some species, multiple sex determination alleles are segregating within a single species, allowing for more than two genotypic sexes. Here we investigate the effects of multiple alleles on secondary sexual characteristics in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii, where two female- and two male-determining alleles interact to produce siblings with four possible sex classes. We find that multiple alleles can produce modular variation in traits, including genital morphology, craniofacial morphology, gastrointestinal morphology, and home tank behaviors. These results provide context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of multiple alleles in sex determination. (Less)"

We sought to understand how intracellular iron (Fe) impacts the retina, given that Fe is a key component of ROS-generating enzymes and that Fe is also a component of bisretinoid lipofuscin. We found that intracellular Fe promotes the oxidation and degradation of bisretinoid lipofuscin. These findings have implications for the retina in general and for the RPE in particular, given that the RPE is challenged by accumulations of bisretinoid lipofuscin. Thus, our findings may have relevance for the prevention of age-related macular degeneration. (PsycINFO Database Record"

However, the evolution of specialization is often considered a dead end, as it leads to morphological and functional convergence. Here we show that siphonophores, a group of pelagic cnidarians, are an exception to this rule. We show that siphonophores can evolve from generalists to specialists on different prey types, and that these transitions are associated with specific evolutionary changes in the morphology of their tentacles. Our findings help understand how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs. They also provide insights into the evolution of specialization in other predators."

However, the evolution of the hand is poorly understood because of a lack of fossils from the time when the first modern human-like species arose and spread across Africa. Here we show that a key derived feature of the hand, the third metacarpal styloid process, was present in a fossil from East Africa that lived ∼1.42 million years ago. This fossil thus provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key shared derived characteristic of modern human and Neandertal hand morphology and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus. This fossil also provides the earliest evidence for the evolution of a derived hand in the genus Homo."

The enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) is a key regulator of this process. Here we show that dual knockout of SHMT1 and SHMT2 in cancer cells blocks tumor growth. We also identify a small-molecule inhibitor of SHMT1/2, which is effective in cancer cells and in xenograft models. Finally, we show that one-carbon donor formate is a potent inhibitor of SHMT, and that this effect is reversed in cancer cells that are defective in glycine import. Thus, we have identified a metabolic vulnerability of cancer cells that can be exploited therapeutically. This work represents a major advance in our understanding of cancer metabolism, and has the potential to impact cancer treatment."

This study shows that deforestation can reduce people’s consumption of fruits and vegetables and thus their vitamin A adequacy. Conversely, forest fragmentation can increase people’s consumption of fruits and vegetables and thus their vitamin A adequacy. These findings have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. This study also highlights the importance of using causal inference methods to understand the effects of deforestation on people’s diets. This is a relatively new approach in the field of nutrition geography. We believe that this study will be of interest to researchers and policy makers interested in the role of forests in improving people’s diets and in the role of forests in improving people’s health more generally."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We hypothesize that this trend is a consequence of the increasing size of farm machinery, which is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods."
