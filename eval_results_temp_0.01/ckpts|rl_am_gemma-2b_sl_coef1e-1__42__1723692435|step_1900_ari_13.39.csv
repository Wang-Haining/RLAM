In this study, we show that the SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein Orf6 is able to block the nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are critical for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes. Our results demonstrate that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1, a protein complex that mediates nuclear import. We show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its ability to block the nuclear import of STAT1 and STAT2. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of the Hv1 channel. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and to a decrease in mean yields. The probability that the top four maize-exporting countries have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming.

We show that the best candidate designed by us is active against antibiotic-resistant pathogens and that it is more active than telithromycin, the current standard of care. The design strategy presented here can be used to develop new antibiotics for other antibiotic-resistant pathogens. View Full-Text"

However, the number of trainable parameters in these networks is often large, which makes them difficult to train and apply in practice. Here, we introduce a network architecture based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice, and automatically adapts to different problems. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data."

Here we present a continuous, first-of-its-kind 1.3-My record of continental hydroclimate and lake-level variability derived from drill core data from Lake Malawi, East Africa. We observe dramatic shifts in effective moisture, resulting in large-scale changes in one of the world’s largest lakes and most diverse freshwater ecosystems. Results show evidence for 24 lake level drops of more than 200 m during the Late Quaternary, including 15 lowstands when water levels were more than 400 m lower than modern. A dramatic shift is observed at the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT), consistent with far-field climate forcing, which separates vastly different hydroclimate regimes before and after ∼800,000 years ago. Before 800 ka, lake levels were lower, indicating a climate drier than today, and water levels changed frequently. Following the MPT high-amplitude lake level variations dominate the record.

APOE2 enhances the rate of phagocytosis of synapses by astrocytes, whereas APO4 decreases it. We also found that the amount of C1q protein accumulation in hippocampus, which may represent the accumulation of senescent synapses with enhanced vulnerability to complement-mediated degeneration, is highly dependent on APOE alleles: C1q accumulation was significantly reduced in APOE2 knock-in (KI) animals and was significantly increased in APOE4 KI animals compared with APOE3 KI animals.

Here, we show that the evolution of an aquatic lifestyle is driving three of the four extant aquatic mammal clades toward a size attractor at ∼500 kg. The existence of this body size attractor and the relatively rapid selection toward, and limited deviation from, this attractor rule out most hypothesized drivers of size increase. These three independent body size increases and a shared aquatic optimum size are consistent with control by differences in the scaling of energetic intake and cost functions with body size between the terrestrial and aquatic realms. Under this energetic model, thermoregulatory costs constrain minimum size, whereas limitations on feeding efficiency constrain maximum size. The optimum size occurs at an intermediate value where thermoregulatory costs are low but feeding efficiency remains high. Rather than being released from size pressures, water-dwelling mammals are driven and confined to larger body sizes by the strict energetic demands of the aquatic medium."

However, the ACI is difficult to be well represented in current climate models. This is due to the lack of high-resolution and simultaneous observations of diurnal aerosol loading and cloud microphysical properties. To overcome this conundrum, we introduce the dual-field-of-view (FOV) high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) for simultaneously profiling aerosol and water cloud properties, especially water cloud microphysical properties. This instrument, verified by the Monte Carlo simulation and coincident observations of other techniques, was used to conduct continuous observations of aerosols and clouds over Beijing. The observations show that the increased aerosol loading led to increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius, which is consistent with expectations. However, the aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations obtained from the dual-FOV HSRL constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. C-type inactivation in BK channels is closed state-dependent and its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. Our findings provide insights into the mechanism of K+ channel regulation. They also provide a possible explanation for the BK channel’s unique properties, such as its normal closing and no C-type inactivation. These findings may also have implications for the development of K+ channel modulators."

Our findings suggest that the parasite primes the erythrocyte surface, reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion. This study provides a new perspective on the invasion process and opens up new avenues for the development of new antimalarial strategies. (Show more)"

We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences.

Furthermore, the polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR.

The ability of fungi to sequester copper in the form of xanthocillin-like compounds suggests that these fungi have evolved a mechanism to balance the need for copper with the potential for toxicity. This study demonstrates that the xanthocillin-like compounds are copper-binding molecules and that they have antimicrobial properties. The existence of the xanthocillin-like compound biosynthetic gene cluster in several filamentous fungi suggests that this mechanism of copper homeostasis may be widespread in fungi. This study provides insight into the role of fungal natural products in the regulation of copper homeostasis and the interactions of fungi with other microbes. (Show more)"

Areas in which frost events are rare, such as broad-leaved forests and shrublands in Europe and Asia, instead harbor opportunistic tree species (quickly reacting to warming air temperatures). These strategies are likely to have been selected by the frost events of the past.

Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period.

We also show that IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, and we generated an antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling. These results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. Furthermore, our results provide a proof of principle for the use of antibody-mediated killing of leukemia cells in the treatment of leukemia. This approach may be applicable to other types of cancer. (Show more)"

We used a grid-based approach to sample the genomic diversity across the island, which allowed us to reconstruct the history of the Malagasy people. We find that the Malagasy people are a mixture of Bantu and Austronesian populations, with a limited contribution from Europe and the Middle East. The settlement history of Madagascar is complex, with a recent arrival of the Malagasy people, but with a sex bias in the colonization of the island. Finally, we find that the genetic diversity of Madagascar is influenced by geography, independent of the settlement history. This study provides a unique view of the history of Madagascar.

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation."

Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

We show that small tributaries can be a significant source of nutrients to coastal areas, and that their nutrient loads are often high for their size. Our findings suggest that nutrient management efforts should be expanded to small tributaries to reduce the ecological impacts of nutrient loading on valuable nearshore ecosystems."

We find that the long-time dynamics of such systems are biased toward states that exhibit a fine-tuned extremization of the environmental forcing. This behavior is reminiscent of the “fine-tuning problem” in cosmology, where the rare combinations of initial conditions that led to the observed universe are biased toward states that are far from equilibrium."

Here, we present a study of an abrupt climate change event that occurred during a glacial period. We show that the event was linked to a large injection of organic matter into the ocean, which led to an increase in atmospheric CO2 and a biodiversity nadir. We also show that the event was linked to an increase in nutrient fluxes and thermocline stratification, which may have been driven by the release of stored heat in the deep ocean. This work provides insights into the mechanisms that led to the event and the potential impacts of such events on the Earth system."

In response, many major corporations and countries have made commitments to purchase only “sustainable” palm oil. Certification is the tool most used to fulfill these procurement policies, and around 20% of global palm oil production was certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) in 2017. However, the effect of certification on deforestation in oil palm plantations remains unclear. Here, we show that certification is associated with reduced deforestation in Indonesia, the leading producer of palm oil. Nevertheless, most plantations contained little residual forest when they received certification. As a result, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation.

In humans, its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. In this study, we discovered a small molecule that binds to the EXO70 subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

In vertebrates, sex is determined by a single locus, resulting in two sexes, or by multiple loci, resulting in more than two sexes. In this study, we show that the multiple alleles of a single locus can result in a modular system of sex determination, where the sex of an individual is determined by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. This modular system of sex determination provides a context for understanding the maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations."

One class of ROS is generated by the oxidation of the lipofuscin pigments that accumulate in the retina. The other class of ROS is generated by the photodegradation of the lipofuscin pigments. We show that the accumulation of iron in the retina promotes the photodegradation of the lipofuscin pigments.

Our results show that the evolution of siphonophore feeding structures has been shaped by the evolution of their prey. This study contributes to understanding the evolution of the feeding strategies of predators, and the role of morphological evolution in the diversification of food webs."

The evolution of the human hand has been linked to the evolution of modern human behavior, and the fossil record of the hominin hand has been a key to understanding the origins of modern human behavior. However, the fossil record of the hominin hand is sparse between 800,000 and 1.8 My old, a time interval well documented for the emergence and subsequent proliferation of Acheulian technology. Here we show that the third metacarpal styloid was present in a 1.42-Myr-old fossil from Kenya, suggesting that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants.
