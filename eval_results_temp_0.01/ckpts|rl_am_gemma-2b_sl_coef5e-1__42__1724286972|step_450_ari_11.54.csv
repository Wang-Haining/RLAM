However, the guest molecules are usually assumed to be tightly bound to the host lattices. Here, we report the synthesis and in situ neutron diffraction study of neon hydrate. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of water channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The resolved structure is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. Our results provide a new route to synthesize hydrates and a new perspective on the guest–host interactions in hydrates.

But its mathematical foundations are mysterious. This paper provides a new perspective on the foundations of quantum theory. It shows that the category of Hilbert spaces and bounded operators is equivalent to the category of continuous linear operators on the category of sets. This result is purely categorical and does not presuppose any analytical structure. It is therefore a step toward a more conceptual understanding of quantum theory. It also provides a new foundation for the theory of quantum information.

The evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, and a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we present a genomic and transcriptomic analysis of two distantly related myxozoan species and compare them to the transcriptome and genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results show that the myxozoan body plan was reduced to a minimal structure, and that the genome was reduced to one of the smallest reported in animals. Our findings provide insight into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of the Hv1 channel. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 channel. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels"

This study quantifies the magnitude of this increase and its consequences for global maize production. We find that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields will increase to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields. For the top four maize-exporting countries, which account for 87% of global maize exports, the probability that they have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. They also underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

However, the extent to which they partition food resources is largely unknown because of a lack of comprehensive species-level diet information. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammalian herbivores in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in body size and digestive physiology. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages.

However, the magnitude of the problem is still unknown. We show that the global load of floating plastic debris is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. Our observations of the size distribution of floating plastic debris point at important size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean.

This effect is associated with a reduction of truncated α-syn, which is a hallmark of MSA. VX-765 also reduces the toxicity of α-syn in oligodendrocytes. Finally, VX-765 is able to preserve the number of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in the substantia nigra of MSA mice.

Cancer cells are characterized by uncontrolled proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. In this study, we found that cancer cells with mutations in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway are resistant to ferroptosis, a form of regulated necrosis driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. This resistance is mediated by activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1/stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1-dependent lipogenesis. In contrast, cancer cells with loss of function of the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) are sensitive to ferroptosis. This sensitivity is mediated by sustained activation of mTORC1 and induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1/stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1-dependent lipogenesis.

However, the function of TRAP1 in normal cells is more complex than previously appreciated. We have shown that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 may act as a tumor suppressor in some settings. These data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This may have implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc."

We find that ADF binds to filaments and severes them in a mechanical torque-dependent manner. We propose that this mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells.

The intermediate is the obligatory step on the folding pathway. The intermediate is composed of segments that are distant in the sequence but adjacent in the native protein.

We show that RppH prefers to deprotect Np4-capped RNAs over their dinucleoside triphosphate (Np3) and diphosphate counterparts. This preference is due to the unusual manner in which Np4-capped RNAs bind to the active site of RppH, positioning the δ-phosphate for attack by the enzyme.

This instrument is capable of providing high-resolution and simultaneous observations of aerosols and clouds. A case study over Beijing highlights the scientific potential of this instrument to become a significant contributor to the ACI investigations.

Ion channels are also regulated by their pore gates. Ion channels commonly possess two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that BK channels can exhibit slow C-type inactivation/recovery. We propose that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also propose that BK channel C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent. Our findings provide insights into the regulation of ion channels. Copyright © 2016. Published by Elsevier Inc."

This finding suggests that the malaria parasite primes the erythrocyte surface through its binding antigens, altering the biophysical nature of the target cell and thus reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion. This finding would constitute a major change in our concept of malaria parasite invasion, suggesting it is, in fact, a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces working together to facilitate entry.

We find that low humidity impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in mice lacking caspase-1/11, an enzyme involved in host defense against influenza virus infection. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide insights into the impact of dry air on host defense against influenza virus infection and disease outcome.

To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results suggest that MERS-CoV, but not bat coronavirus HKU4, has adapted to use human cells for cross-species transmission. This study also suggests that bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmission.

The stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. In S. cerevisiae, the extreme stability of the pol δ holoenzyme ensures that every nucleobase within an Okazaki fragment is faithfully duplicated before dissociation. However, the human pol δ holoenzyme is unstable and dissociates rapidly. Here, we show that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with the PCNA sliding clamp while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. Our results provide a unique insight into the molecular mechanism of lagging strand synthesis in humans.

In the hypothesized RNA world, before the evolution of proteins, genetic information was stored in RNA. In this study, we used in vitro evolution to improve the activity of an RNA polymerase ribozyme, which catalyzes the replication of RNA. The improved polymerase ribozyme can synthesize a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and, in low yield, even tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase ribozyme can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins.

We estimate that the pandemic has reduced life expectancy at birth and at age 65 y for the total US population and by race and ethnicity. The Black and Latino populations are estimated to experience declines in life expectancy at birth of 2.10 and 3.05 y, respectively, both of which are several times the 0.68-y reduction for Whites. These projections imply an increase of nearly 40% in the Black−White life expectancy gap, from 3.6 y to over 5 y, thereby eliminating progress made in reducing this differential since 2006. Latinos, who have consistently experienced lower mortality than Whites, would see their more than 3-y survival advantage reduced to less than 1 y. These findings underscore the need for public health interventions to reduce the racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. This article is protected by copyright.

However, the mechanisms by which this is achieved are poorly understood. Here, we show that the squid Euprymna scolopes regulates the activities of its luminescent symbionts through the strategic provision of a single glycan. This glycan is released by host immune cells just before dusk, when the squid is at its most vulnerable to predation. The glycan is catabolized by the symbionts, which in turn use the resulting metabolites to maintain a healthy symbiont population and to acidify the crypts, which enhances the luminescence of the symbionts. This study provides a new perspective on the regulation of symbionts by their hosts. It also suggests that the provision of nutrients to symbionts may be a more common mechanism of host control over their microbial communities than previously thought.

In this study, we generated conditional knockout (CKO) mice that lack ASK1 in T cells, dendritic cells, microglia/macrophages, microglia, or astrocytes. We found that ASK1 deficiency in microglia/macrophages and astrocytes reduced neuroinflammation in the later stage of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). ASK1 signaling in microglia/macrophages played a major role in the generation and maintenance of disease. Astrocytes produced key inflammatory mediators, including CCL2, which further activated and recruited microglia/macrophages. Astrocyte-specific analysis revealed that CCL2 expression was higher in the later stage compared with the early stage, suggesting a greater proinflammatory role of astrocytes in the later stage.

The drought began in 2012 and has led to acute water shortages, groundwater overdraft, critically low streamflow, and enhanced wildfire risk. We find that precipitation deficits that occurred when conditions were warm were more than twice as likely to yield drought years. We also find that the probability of drought years has increased in the past two decades. In addition, the probability that precipitation deficits co-occur with warm conditions and the probability that precipitation deficits produce drought have both increased. These findings suggest that anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of co-occurring warm–dry conditions like those that have created the acute human and ecosystem impacts associated with the “exceptional” 2012–2014 drought in California.

The etiology of autism is so complicated because it involves the effects of variants of several hundred risk genes along with the contribution of environmental factors. Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that behavioral flexibility is a converging target of the autism-risk genes. This study provides a framework for understanding the causal paths that lead to autism. It also provides a model system for studying the molecular mechanisms of autism. This study may also provide a new approach for drug development for autism. This article is protected by copyright.

The disease is caused by mutations in a variety of proteins, including superaggregation-prone proteins such as superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), the TDP-43 protein, and the FUS protein. Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions in the brain and spinal cord are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. Instead, we show that the coaggregating proteins have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into endosomes. Uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases.

However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we show that hypobaric hypoxia induces cerebral edema in rats and that this is associated with increased expression of corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF), CRF receptor type 1 (CRFR1), aquaporin-4 (AQP4), and endothelin-1 (ET-1) in the cortex. We also show that the up-regulated expression of CRFR1 and AQP4 is mediated by CRF acting on CRFR1 to trigger signaling of cAMP/PKA in cortical astrocytes, leading to activation of AQP4 and cerebral edema. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms of cerebral edema induced by hypobaric hypoxia.

The selective packaging of viral RNA into virions is a fundamental process in all viruses. Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus. We show that this interaction takes place in infected cells and is required for optimal viral replication. We also show that this interaction favors copackaging of the interacting viral RNA segments. Our results indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions. The lack of conservation of these interactions might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses.

The Mount Takahe eruption led to stratospheric ozone depletion, which in turn caused a sudden warming and a poleward shift of the Southern Hemisphere westerlies. This shift in the westerlies is consistent with the start of accelerated deglaciation. This study shows that volcanic eruptions can have a profound impact on climate. This is important because volcanic eruptions are the only natural mechanism that can rapidly change climate. Therefore, volcanic eruptions should be included in climate model sensitivity tests.

The role of fibrous sheath interacting protein 1 (FSIP1) in TNBC has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 is highly expressed in TNBC and is associated with poor prognosis. FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. This article is protected by copyright.

The pathophysiology of alcohol dependence is not fully understood, but it is considered a brain disorder. In this study, we found that some alcohol-dependent subjects develop gut leakiness, which is associated with higher scores of depression, anxiety, and alcohol craving after 3 wk of abstinence. Moreover, subjects with increased gut permeability also had altered composition and activity of the gut microbiota. These results suggest the existence of a gut–brain axis in alcohol dependence, which implicates the gut microbiota as an actor in the gut barrier and in behavioral disorders. Thus, the gut microbiota seems to be a previously unidentified target in the management of alcohol dependence. This study also shows that the gut microbiota is a potential biomarker of alcohol dependence. This finding opens new perspectives in the management of alcohol dependence.

However, the biosynthetic pathways of many of these compounds are not known. Here, we report the identification of a gene essential for the production of all the detectable nitrogenous volatiles in tomato fruit. We show that this gene encodes a flavin-dependent monooxygenase that hydroxylates a nitrogen-containing precursor to produce a mixture of the corresponding 2-substituted oxime, nitro, and nitrile volatiles. This pathway is distinct from other known flavin-dependent monooxygenases in plants and provides a major step forward in understanding and ultimately improving tomato flavor quality.

However, these threats are frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. Our findings have important implications for our ability to predict the impacts of climate change on ecosystem functioning. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Here, we show that striatonigral fibers originating in striosomes form highly unusual bouquet-like arborizations that target bundles of ventrally extending dopamine-containing dendrites and clusters of their parent nigral cell bodies. These clustered cell bodies in turn project to the striatum as part of the classic nigrostriatal pathway. Thus, these striosome–dendron bouquets likely represent subsystems with the nigro–striato–nigral loop that are affected in human disorders including Parkinson’s disease. Given evidence that striosomes receive input from cortical regions related to the control of mood and motivation and that they link functionally to reinforcement and decision-making, the striosome–dendron bouquets could be critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease.

People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

However, small tributaries exhibited nutrient loads that were high for their size and biased toward dissolved inorganic forms. This suggests that nutrients from small watersheds may be more available to fuel algal blooms in nearshore areas.

These findings help build a broader perspective on predatory niche diversification via morphological evolution. This study contributes to understanding how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs."

It is the only tool-using appendage and is the most complex of any mammal. The evolution of the human hand is a key topic in human evolution. However, the fossil record is sparse between 800,000 and 1.8 My old. Here we show that the third metacarpal styloid process, a key derived feature of the human hand, was present in a fossil from 1.42 My old. This fossil thus provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key shared derived characteristic of modern human and Neandertal hand morphology. This finding suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus. This is important because it suggests that the evolution of the human hand was not a gradual process but rather a series of rapid evolutionary changes. This finding also has implications for the evolution of the human brain. The human hand and brain are both large relative to body size. The evolution of the human hand may have been a key factor in the evolution of the human brain. This finding suggests that the"

We show that the one-carbon donor of tetrahydrofolate, serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), is a key metabolic target of cancer. We identify a small-molecule inhibitor of SHMT, and show that it blocks colon cancer tumor growth. We also show that formate, the one-carbon donor of SHMT, rescues cells from SHMT inhibition. Formate is a critical metabolite in cancer, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We show that formate-dependent glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Thus, defective glycine import is a metabolic deficiency of cancer. This deficiency can be targeted to block cancer growth. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

In this study, we show that deforestation can have a negative impact on people’s diets. We also show that forest fragmentation can have a positive impact. These findings have important implications for policy makers, who need to consider the role of natural landscapes in improving people’s diets. This study also highlights the need for more research on the role of natural landscapes in improving people’s diets."

However, it has come at the cost of soil degradation. Soil compaction is a major threat to soil productivity. We show that the weight of modern farm machinery has increased soil compaction to levels that are now widespread. We also show that the weight of modern farm machinery is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods. This suggests that prehistoric roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles. We propose that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This article is protected by copyright.
