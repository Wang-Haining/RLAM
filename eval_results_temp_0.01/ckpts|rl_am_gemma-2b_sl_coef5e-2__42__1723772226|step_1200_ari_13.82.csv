However, the structure of ice II with a guest molecule dissolved in it has not been resolved. Here, we report the structure of ice II with neon dissolved in it at 480 MPa and 260 K. The guest atoms are found to be free to move in the channels of water molecules, which is a unique feature of this hydrate. The structure of the hydrate is stable under the experimental conditions.

In this paper, we propose a new set of axioms for quantum mechanics that are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. We show that these axioms are sufficient to recover all the basic structures of quantum mechanics, including the algebra of observables, the state space, the evolution, and the measurement problem. Our approach is based on the notion of continuous linear maps between Hilbert spaces, which is a purely categorical concept. This provides a way to unify and extend many of the existing approaches to the foundations of quantum mechanics. Our work also has implications for the foundations of mathematics itself."

The evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, and a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the genomes and transcriptomes of two distantly related species, Myxobolus cerebralis and Kudoa iwatai, and a less reduced cnidarian, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results show that the Myxozoa are a sister group to the cnidarians and are a highly reduced group in terms of genome size and gene content. These results provide insight into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. They also suggest that the Myxozoa are a model system for studying the evolution of parasitism. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1, but the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1.

Here, we quantify the impact of climate change on the variability of maize yields in the major maize-producing and -exporting countries. We find that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields will increase almost everywhere to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. They also underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance."

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species of African herbivores. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers, and the extent to which they consumed grasses varied from &gt;99% to &lt;1%. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of species matched in body size and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages, and that diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This work provides a framework for understanding the role of niche partitioning in the coexistence of large herbivores."

Our data indicate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of the plasma membrane ORAI channel. Our findings may help to develop new strategies for treating hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. (Show more)"

Our results suggest that the NWFP has been successful in protecting older forests, but that the policy has not been effective in halting the decline of older-forest–associated bird species. This is partly due to the fact that the NWFP did not protect enough older forests, and partly due to the continued decline of older forests from fire."

The design strategy is based on the prediction of the solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity of acylide antibiotics. We show that the predicted best candidate is more active than telithromycin, a clinically used antibiotic, and is up to 56 times more active against resistant pathogens than telithromycin. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. The presented approach can be used to design new antibiotics for other targets and for other antibiotics. This work is a step toward the development of new antibiotics."

However, the number of trainable parameters in these networks can be very large, which can make it difficult to train the network, especially when the number of parameters is large. In this work, we introduce a network architecture that is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters. The network architecture is based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters. The proposed architecture can be used in many image-processing problems in the future."

Actin depolymerizing factor (ADF) is a key regulator of actin filament disassembly. However, how it does so in a physiological context, where filaments are interconnected and under mechanical stress, remains unclear. Here, we monitor and quantify the action of ADF in different mechanical situations by using single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques, coupled to microfluidics. We find that local curvature favors severing, while tension surprisingly has no effect on ADF binding and weakly enhances severing. Remarkably, we observe that filament segments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist, experience a mechanical torque upon ADF binding. We propose that this ADF-induced torque increases the severing rate constant 100-fold. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. Our findings provide a mechanism for how the mechanical state of the cytoskeleton can be used to control the activity of proteins involved in cell biology.

The settlement history is complex, and we find that the island was settled by multiple waves of people from different parts of Africa and Asia. The distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the settlement was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population.

The temperature of the surface is important for understanding the evolution of life on Earth, as well as for the habitability of the planet. The temperature of the surface has been inferred from isotopic data to have decreased over geological time, but this interpretation has been subject to question due to uncertainties regarding the isotopic record. Here, we present a method for reconstructing the temperature of the surface based on the thermostability of ancestral enzymes. Our results suggest that Earth’s surface temperature decreased over geological time from ∼65–80 °C in the Archean, a finding consistent both with previous isotope-based and protein reconstruction-based interpretations. Interdisciplinary studies such as those reported here integrating genomic, geologic, and paleontologic data hold promise for providing new insight into the coevolution of life and environment over Earth history.

The activation and inactivation of ion channels are important for the control of cell excitability and the maintenance of homeostasis. The K+ channel, BK, is one of the most important K+ channels in the heart. It is responsible for the regulation of the resting membrane potential and the cardiac contractility. The BK channel is unique in that it does not have an intracellular activation gate and shows no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is state-dependent and that its rates and extents are inversely correlated with the channel-open probability. We propose that the BK channel’s closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. This study provides a new perspective on the regulation of ion channels. (Show more)"

The parasite, Plasmodium, uses a variety of mechanisms to invade the red blood cell (RBC) and cause disease. Here, we show that the malaria parasite uses a single protein, erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 (EBA175), to bind to glycophorin A (GPA) on the surface of the RBC. We show that this interaction alters the biophysical properties of the RBC, reducing the energy barrier to invasion. This is a major change in our understanding of malaria invasion, suggesting that the parasite and host cell are working together to facilitate entry. This work provides a new perspective on the malaria parasite invasion process and may lead to the development of new strategies to combat the disease. (Show more)"

In the temperate regions, seasonal influenza virus outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in humidity. While low ambient humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes them more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that induction of antiviral response is impaired in the lung of mice exposed to dry air, and that this dampened response contributes to disease pathology. Our study provides mechanistic insights into the impact of dry air on influenza virus infection and disease outcome. These insights may be useful for the development of strategies to mitigate the impact of influenza virus infection. (Show more)"

This merge operation is applied equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity, and it is consistent with a neural implementation of a bottom-up or left-corner parser of the incoming language stream. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases."

The auditory organs of animals are extremely diverse in anatomy after hundreds of millions of years of evolution, yet they are all made up of cellular tissue and are morphologically part of the body. Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. We find that the spider’s web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to sense the motion of web threads, which is better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself. The outsourcing and supersizing of auditory function in spiders provide unique features for studying extended and regenerative sensing and designing novel acoustic flow detectors for precise fluid dynamic measurement and manipulation. This study also provides a unique example of outsourcing and supersizing of sensory function in animals."

In humans, this clamp is proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). The stability of the PCNA-pol δ holoenzyme is critical for every aspect of lagging strand replication. However, the stability of the holoenzyme in humans is unknown. We developed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the holoenzyme. The results indicate that the holoenzyme maintains a loose association with the clamp while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from the clamp on stalling at a DNA lesion. This study provides a unique perspective on the stability of the PCNA-pol δ holoenzyme and its implications for DNA replication. (Show more)"

The RNA world is a hypothesized stage in the evolution of life, in which genetic information was stored in RNA molecules rather than in DNA. In this study, we report the development of an RNA polymerase ribozyme that can synthesize functional RNA molecules from an RNA template. This polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins.

Neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, these results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities. Our results also highlight the importance of the initial appearance of neighborhoods in determining their future physical condition."

The band structures of the 2D photonic crystals are predicted to produce unconventional atom–light interaction behaviors, including anisotropic emission, suppressed spontaneous decay, and photon-mediated atom–atom interactions controlled by the position of the atomic array relative to the photonic crystal. The device configuration also enables application of optical tweezers for controlled placement of atoms. Devices can be fabricated reliably from a 200-nm silicon nitride device layer using a lithography-based process, producing predicted optical properties in transmission and reflection measurements. These 2D photonic crystal devices can be readily deployed to experiments for many-body physics with neutral atoms and engineering of exotic quantum matter. The photonic crystals can be used to control the interactions between atoms, allowing for the study of many-body physics in a new regime.

To understand how sequential proteolysis contributes to infection, we introduced mutations that blocked the first cleavages of the spike (S) glycoprotein. These mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses trafficked past cell-surface proteases and into endosomes, whereas precleaved viruses used endosomal fusion-activating proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry. Uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Therefore, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of"

We connect changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods with economic and demographic data and find that three factors predict neighborhood improvement: the density of college-educated adults, the initial appearance of the neighborhood, and the proximity of the neighborhood to other attractive neighborhoods. These results are consistent with three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities. Our results also provide a new way to measure the success of urban revitalization efforts."

However, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Here, we show that the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis is driven by altered nutrient cycling during heat stress. This shift from nutrient uptake to release by the coral host promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host. Our results provide a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection.

Here, we show that Si pretreatment of rice plants increases resistance against the rice leaffolder, a major insect pest of rice, and that this effect is mediated by an increase in silicon cell deposition and the jasmonate (JA) signaling pathway. Our results suggest that silicon may be able to enhance plant resistance against insect herbivores by priming the jasmonate signaling pathway. This study provides a new perspective on the role of silicon in plant stress tolerance and insect resistance. (Show more)"

We show that the 6 largest tributaries of Lake Michigan account for ∼70% of the daily nutrient loads delivered to the lake. However, small tributaries exhibit nutrient loads that are high for their size and biased toward dissolved inorganic forms. This suggests that their plumes become trapped and then overlap in the nearshore zone, increasing the likelihood of coastal eutrophication. Our findings reveal an underappreciated role that small streams may play in driving coastal eutrophication in large water bodies."

Certification is the tool most used to fulfill these procurement policies, and around 20% of global palm oil production was certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) in 2017. However, the effect of certification on deforestation in oil palm plantations remains unclear. Here, we show that certification is associated with reduced deforestation in Indonesia, the leading producer of palm oil. Certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation."

In many species, sex is determined by a single gene, but in others, multiple genes interact to determine sex. In this study, we investigate the effects of multiple interacting sex determination alleles on the secondary sexual characteristics of a species. We find that the interaction of multiple sex determination alleles can produce a modular system of sexual variation, where the same trait can be sexually dimorphic in one population and monomorphic in another. This modular system of sexual variation can be used to understand the evolutionary causes and consequences of sex determination alleles in populations. (Show more)"

Here we show that the evolution of specialization in siphonophores is not a dead end, but rather a process that has led to the evolution of new prey types. Our results show that the evolution of specialization is linked to the evolution of the morphology and mode of evolution of the tentilla, and suggest that shifts between prey types are linked to shifts in the morphology, mode of evolution, and evolutionary correlations of tentilla and their nematocysts. These findings contribute to understanding how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs."

Here we report the discovery of a hominin hand fossil from East Africa that preserves the third metacarpal styloid process, a key derived feature of the human hand that is absent in early hominins. This fossil provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of this feature and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo.

We show that the increase in vehicle weight has led to the propagation of compaction into deeper soil layers, and that the current level of compaction is now higher than the safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map of subsoil compaction susceptibility, and found that 20% of arable land is at risk of chronic compaction. This alarming trend calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants.
