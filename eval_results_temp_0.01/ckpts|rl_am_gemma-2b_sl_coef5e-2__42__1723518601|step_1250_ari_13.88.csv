The structure of ice II is of great importance to the understanding of the origin of the high-pressure phase of water, which is of great interest in the study of the Earth’s interior. In this work, we report the structure of ice II hydrate, which is a new phase of water. The structure of ice II hydrate is of the same type as ice II, but with the guest atoms being replaced by the host atoms. The guest atoms are enclathrated in the channels of the host ice II. The guest atoms are free to move in the channels, which is a unique feature of this structure. This work provides a new perspective on the structure of ice II."

However, it is not a theory in the ordinary sense of the word, in that it is not based on a classical foundation. This has led to a number of attempts to provide such a foundation, and to prove that the resulting theories are equivalent to quantum theory. The most promising of these attempts is the reconstruction program, which has led to a number of different foundations. The foundations differ in the precise mathematical structure they use, but all of them are based on a common mathematical foundation: the category of Hilbert spaces and operators on them. We provide a set of axioms for this category that guarantees that it is equivalent to the category of continuous linear operators between Hilbert spaces, regardless of the precise structure used in the foundations. This resolves a question raised in the context of the reconstruction program."

The Myxozoa are thought to have evolved from a free-living ancestor that parasitizes cnidarians, and thus the study of the Myxozoa can provide insights into the evolution of parasitism. Here, we present a genomic analysis of two myxozoan species and a cnidarian parasite, and we show that the Myxozoa are a sister group to the cnidarians. We also show that the myxozoan genome is one of the smallest reported animal genomes, and that it is reduced in gene content. These results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by extreme reduction in gene content. This study provides a genomic framework for future studies of the evolution of parasitism in the Myxozoa and in the evolution of the cnidarian body plan."

The virus responsible for this pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is able to evade the host immune response by blocking interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral signaling. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We found that the viral accessory protein ORF6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

This variability will increase the probability of simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year in the top four maize-exporting countries to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is largely unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa in the field. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammal species in semiarid African savanna. We found that species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption had the greatest overlap in diet, but that even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location had different diets. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammal assemblages, and that diversity of large mammal species may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This study highlights the importance of species-level identification in understanding the mechanisms that maintain biodiversity. (Less)"

Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated."

The development of new antibiotics is a major challenge, and computational approaches are essential tools to this end since their application enables fast and early strategical decisions in the drug development process. Here, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. This approach can be extended to other antibiotic classes and to other targets. This work is expected to contribute to the development of new antibiotics."

We propose that this torque is critical for ADF to sever highly connected filaments. Our results have implications for understanding the role of mechanical stress in ADF-mediated regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. They also have implications for understanding the role of twist in the action of other molecular motors."

However, the complexity of ACI makes it difficult to be well represented in current climate models. The main reason is that the observational capability is inadequate. To overcome this conundrum, we introduce the dual-field-of-view (FOV) high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) for simultaneously profiling aerosol and water cloud properties, especially water cloud microphysical properties. The observations of aerosols and clouds using this instrument, verified by the Monte Carlo simulation and coincident observations of other techniques, were conducted to investigate the interactions between aerosol loading and water cloud microphysical properties. A case study over Beijing highlights the scientific potential of dual-FOV HSRL to become a significant contributor to the ACI investigations. The observations obtained from the dual-FOV HSRL constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI process. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The temperature history of the surface is inferred to be linked to the temperature history of the oceans, which in turn is linked to the evolution of life. The temperature of the surface is also linked to the temperature of the atmosphere, which in turn is linked to the evolution of the atmosphere. Thus, the temperature history of the surface is linked to the evolution of life in a complex and interconnected manner. This study provides a new method for reconstructing the temperature history of the surface of the Earth, and thus the evolution of life, by using the thermostability of ancestral enzymes. The results of this study provide evidence for a cooling of the surface of the Earth over geological time, which is consistent with other methods of temperature reconstruction. This study demonstrates the value of integrating genomic, geologic, and paleontologic data to provide new insights into the coevolution of life and environment over Earth history. (Less)"

In temperate regions, seasonal outbreaks of influenza virus are associated with decreases in ambient humidity. However, the impact of humidity on host defense and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that mice housed in low humidity are more susceptible to severe disease following influenza virus infection. We also show that low humidity impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection and disease outcome in the context of low humidity.

However, whether and how the brain builds such structures remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the brain’s high-gamma power increases with each successive word in a sentence but decreases suddenly whenever words can be merged into a phrase. This merge operation is applied equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity, providing evidence for a merge operation that applies equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity. More superficial models of language, based solely on sequential transition probability over lexical and syntactic categories, only captured activity in the posterior middle temporal gyrus. Formal model comparison indicated that the model of multiword phrase construction provided a better fit than probability-based models at most sites in superior temporal and inferior frontal cortices. Activity in those regions was consistent with a neural implementation of a bottom-up or left-corner parser of the incoming language stream. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases."

To understand how these bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions. Our findings provide insights into the molecular basis of the cross-species transmission of MERS-CoV and other bat coronaviruses. They also provide a reference for the development of MERS-CoV vaccines and antiviral drugs. This article"

However, there are also significant differences that have led to the evolution of new mechanisms. One of the most important differences is the role of the PCNA sliding clamp, which is essential for the replication of the lagging strand in humans but not in S. cerevisiae. In humans, the PCNA clamp is essential for the initiation of replication but is dispensable for the synthesis of Okazaki fragments. We show here that the PCNA clamp is also essential for the stability of the human pol δ holoenzyme. This has important implications for the replication of the lagging strand in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion."

This means that climate change may be more important in driving future fire activity than human ignitions. We also find that climate change has already warmed the world by up to 0.11 °C, and that this warming may be reversed by recent and predicted future reductions in fire activity. This highlights the importance of fire in the carbon cycle and the need to better understand the feedbacks between climate, fire, and carbon in the future."

Here, we show that the squid Euprymna scolopes regulates the provision of a single glycan to its symbiotic luminescent bacteria, Vibrio fischeri, in a diel rhythm. We also show that the glycan is required for the persistence of the symbionts in the organ of light, and that the glycan catabolism is required for the periodic acidification of the organ that is necessary for the symbionts to produce light. These results suggest that the provision of nutrients to symbionts may be a more general mechanism for regulating the health of the associated epithelium. This article is protected by copyright.

The IL1RAP (IL1R3) is expressed on candidate leukemic stem cells in the majority of AML patients, but not on normal hematopoietic stem cells. We show here that monoclonal antibodies targeting IL1RAP have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA. Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

In this study, we found that neuroinflammation was reduced in both the early and later stages of EAE in microglia/macrophage-specific ASK1 knockout mice, whereas only the later-stage neuroinflammation was ameliorated in astrocyte-specific ASK1 knockout mice. ASK1 signaling in microglia played a major role in generating and maintaining disease.

The etiology of autism is so complicated because it involves the effects of variants of several hundred risk genes along with the contribution of environmental factors. Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. As an alternative approach, extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying the convergence of the targets and functions of the autism-risk genes to facilitate mapping out causal paths. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflex"

In this study, we show that the spread of aggregates in the Drosophila brain is mediated by endocytosis and that the release of aggregates requires the fusion protein 1 complex. These findings provide a model for the propagation of aggregates in the Drosophila brain and suggest that the mechanisms of spreading in Drosophila and humans may be similar. This model may also be useful for studying the mechanisms of spreading in other neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, the use of Drosophila in this study provides a platform for the development of new therapeutics."

An optical conveyor technique is presented for continuously loading atoms into the desired trapping positions with optimal coupling to the photonic crystal. The device configuration also enables application of optical tweezers for controlled placement of atoms. Devices can be fabricated reliably from a 200-nm silicon nitride device layer using a lithography-based process, producing predicted optical properties in transmission and reflection measurements.

We also show that the two ligands encoded by the human genome are essential for iridophore differentiation in the eye and the body, respectively, and that they are both activated by Ltk and not by Alk. These experiments establish a physiological link between augmentor ligands and Ltk and demonstrate that particular augmentors activate Ltk in a tissue-specific context to induce iridophore differentiation from neural crest-derived cells and pigment progenitor cells.

Herein, we found that STING is decreased in islets of db/db mice and patients with T2D, suggesting a possible role of STING in β-cell dysfunction. Indeed, STING deficiency decreased expression of β-cell function–related genes, contributing to impaired GSIS. Mechanistically, the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) and cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&amp;Tag) analyses suggested that Pax6 was the transcription factor that might be associated with defective GSIS in STING-βKO mice. Together, these data revealed a function of STING in the regulation of insulin secretion and established pathophysiological significance of fine-tuned STING within β-cells and insulin target tissues for maintaining glucose homeostasis.

The viral genome is segmented into eight fragments, which complicates the packaging process. The selective packaging mechanism, in which one copy of each viral RNA is specifically packaged into each virion, is suspected, but its molecular details remain unknown. Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus. This interaction is required for optimal viral replication and favors the copackaging of the interacting viral RNA segments. Our results indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions. The lack of conservation of these interactions might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses.

Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host.

This is critical for predicting the impacts of climate change on the functioning of natural systems and the services they provide."

It is divided into superficial and deep layers, and the superficial layers are subdivided into three distinct zones, which are thought to be involved in different aspects of spatial processing. However, the anatomical and functional organization of the superficial layers is still poorly understood. Here, we used a portable two-photon microscope to image the activity of neurons in the superficial layers of MEC during free-moving behavior. We found that neurons in the superficial layers are organized into three distinct zones, which are anatomically and functionally segregated. These findings provide a detailed view of the organization of the superficial layers of MEC and will be useful for future studies of the function of this important brain structure.

These results suggest that the dopamine system is connected to a system of neurons in the ventral midbrain that is critical to the control of mood and motivation and that this system is affected in Parkinson’s disease.

We asked people to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. We found that the speed at which people responded to each other was a robust predictor of felt connection. People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants."
