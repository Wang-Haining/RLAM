The foundations of quantum theory have been the subject of intense debate for the past century. In this paper we provide a purely categorical approach to the foundations of quantum theory. The approach is based on a set of axioms that are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. The axioms are designed to guarantee that the category of Hilbert spaces and bounded linear operators is equivalent to the category of continuous linear operators between categories. The equivalence preserves the basic structure of the theory, including the basic mathematical objects, the basic mathematical operations, and the basic mathematical theorems. The approach provides a mathematical foundation for quantum theory that is both mathematically rigorous and philosophically neutral."

Although the evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we present the first comparative analysis of the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species, and compare these to the transcriptome and genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. These results have implications for understanding the evolution of the Myxozoa and the origin of parasitism. (Abridged)"

The virus responsible for this disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been shown to be able to evade the antiviral action of the immune system by blocking the nuclear import of transcription factors that are essential for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes. In this study, we show that the viral accessory protein Orf6 is able to block nuclear import of transcription factors and, as a consequence, to impair the expression of IFN-stimulated genes. Our results unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of the proton channel. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on the proton channel: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits the proton channel will further our understanding of the proton channel and might provide valuable information for future drug development for the proton channel"

The development of new antibiotics is a major challenge for the medical community. In this work, we present a computational approach to design new antibiotics. The approach is based on the prediction of the solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity of acylide antibiotics. We show that the predicted best candidate is more active than telithromycin, the current standard of care, and that it is more accessible, exhibits higher solubility, and has a higher binding affinity to the ribosome. The predicted best compound is up to 56 times more active against resistant pathogens than telithromycin. The predicted best compound is also more active than the current standard of care against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. The approach presented here can be used to design new antibiotics for other targets. View Full-Text"

To achieve accurate results in practice, a large number of trainable parameters are often required. Here, we introduce a network architecture based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice, and automatically adapts to different problems. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data."

The results show evidence for 24 lake level drops of more than 200 m during the Late Quaternary, including 15 lowstands when water levels were more than 400 m lower than modern. A dramatic shift is observed at the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT), consistent with far-field climate forcing, which separates vastly different hydroclimate regimes before and after 800,000 years ago. The results provide a unique perspective on the evolution of the Lake Malawi endemic cichlid fish species flock, which rapidly adapted to the changing hydroclimate regime following the MPT. The extreme hydroclimate variability exerted a profound influence on the Lake Malawi endemic cichlid fish species flock, and the habitat reconfiguration provided novel ecological opportunities, enabling new populations to differentiate rapidly to distinct species."

The presence of two copies of the E4 allele increases risk by ∼12-fold whereas E2 allele is associated with an ∼twofold decreased risk for AD. These data put APOE central to AD pathophysiology, but it is not yet clear how APOE alleles modify AD risk.

It is also a unique case in terms of its settlement history. We used a grid-based approach to sample the genomic diversity across Madagascar, and we found that the Malagasy population is a mixture of Bantu and Austronesian populations, with a limited contribution from Europe and the Middle East. The recent demographic history of Madagascar is also reflected in the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island, which is sex biased and heterogeneous. Finally, we show that a few centuries are sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. These results provide a comprehensive view of the settlement history of Madagascar.

Our results suggest that Earth’s surface temperature decreased over geological time from ∼65–80 °C in the Archean, a finding consistent both with previous isotope-based and protein reconstruction-based interpretations. Interdisciplinary studies such as those reported here integrating genomic, geologic, and paleontologic data hold promise for providing new insight into the coevolution of life and environment over Earth history."

Ion channels are composed of a protein backbone and a pore gate. The pore gate is responsible for ion flow and is the main target of drug development. Ion channels have two types of pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. The BK channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter."

The auditory organs of animals are diverse in anatomy, but all are made up of cellular tissue and are morphologically part of the body of the animal. Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. We find that the spider’s web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to sense the motion of web threads, which is better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself. The outsourcing and supersizing of auditory function in spiders provide unique features for studying extended and regenerative sensing and designing novel acoustic flow detectors for precise fluid dynamic measurement and manipulation. This study also provides a unique example of outsourcing and supersizing of sensory function in animals."

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, HM predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. HM was associated with less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia, but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors. The findings highlight the importance of psychological examinations of masculinity as a cultural ideology to understand how men’s and women’s endorsement of HM legitimizes patriarchal dominance and reinforces gender, race, and class-based hierarchies via candidate support.

This suggests that the production process allowed the skins of maturing animals of several species to be rendered into vellum of equal quality and fineness.

There is an urgent need for novel and more efficient therapies, ideally targeting AML stem cells that are essential for maintaining the disease. We show here that monoclonal antibodies targeting the IL1RAP (IL1R3) receptor have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. View Full-Text"

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA. Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete."

However, the majority of studies have been conducted at a single site, limiting our understanding of the response of soil respiration to warming across a range of biomes. Here, we synthesize the largest global dataset of soil respiration, temperature, and moisture measurements, and find that soil respiration rates do not increase with experimental warming in all biomes. Moreover, we find that soil respiration rates follow a Gaussian response, increasing with soil temperature up to a threshold of ∼25 °C, above which respiration rates decrease with further increases in temperature. This consistent decrease in temperature sensitivity at higher temperatures demonstrates that rising global temperatures may result in regionally variable responses in soil respiration, with colder climates being considerably more responsive to increased ambient temperatures compared with warmer regions. Our analysis adds a unique cross-biome perspective on the temperature response of soil respiration, information critical to improving our mechanistic understanding of how soil carbon dynamics change with climatic warming."

In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

The band structures of the 2D photonic crystals are predicted to produce unconventional atom–light interaction behaviors, including anisotropic emission, suppressed spontaneous decay, and photon-mediated atom–atom interactions controlled by the position of the atomic array relative to the photonic crystal. An optical conveyor technique is presented for continuously loading atoms into the desired trapping positions with optimal coupling to the photonic crystal. The device configuration also enables application of optical tweezers for controlled placement of atoms. Devices can be fabricated reliably from a 200-nm silicon nitride device layer using a lithography-based process, producing predicted optical properties in transmission and reflection measurements. These 2D photonic crystal devices can be readily deployed to experiments for many-body physics with neutral atoms and engineering of exotic quantum matter. This work is expected to have broad impact on the field of atom optics and many-body physics."

Our results also highlight the importance of the physical environment in shaping the economic outcomes of individuals and communities."

However, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Here, we show that the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis is driven by altered nutrient cycling during heat stress. This shift from nutrient uptake to release by the coral host promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host. Our results provide a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

We show that the size, shape, compactness, stiffness, and location of the siRNA attachment locus on the DNA nanostructure are important for the internalization efficiency and corresponding gene silencing efficiency. Our work establishes the feasibility of biomolecule delivery to plants with DNA nanostructures and both details the design parameters of importance for plant cell internalization and also assesses the impact of DNA nanostructure geometry for gene silencing mechanisms. This work is a step forward in the development of a new class of tools for the delivery of biomolecules to plants."

Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results highlight the importance of certification in reducing deforestation, but also the need for certification to be part of a broader suite of policies to protect forests. This work also highlights the importance of monitoring and enforcement of certification standards. (Abridged)"

The dysfunction of the exocyst complex is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. However, the study of the dynamic regulation of the exocyst-related processes using mutants in genetically tractable organisms such as Arabidopsis thaliana is limited by the lethality or the severity of phenotypes. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 (exocyst component of 70 kDa) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and offers a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (PsycINFO Database Record"

However, the evolution of specialization is often considered a dead end, as it is difficult to evolve morphological and functional adaptations in separate structures. Here we show that this is not the case in the cnidarian clade siphonophores, which use specialized side branches (tentacles) armed with nematocysts for prey capture. We show that siphonophore specialization is linked to the evolution of morphological changes in the tentacles and nematocysts, and that these changes are linked to prey type.

The use of farm machinery has greatly increased the capacity of agricultural production, but the increase in vehicle weight has led to the propagation of subsoil compaction into deeper soil layers. We show that the risk of subsoil compaction has increased over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity. This alarming trend calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants.
