Here, we present the first comparative genomic analysis of two distantly related myxozoan species and a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. These results provide insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1, but the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

The best candidate is synthetically more accessible, exhibits higher solubility and binding affinity to the ribosome, and is up to 56 times more active against resistant pathogens than telithromycin.

The proposed architecture is based on a simple idea: use dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connect all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice. We show that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters than popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems. We believe that the proposed architecture will be useful for many applications in computer vision and image processing. We hope that the proposed architecture will be useful to the computer vision community."

This study provides a continuous record of the hydroclimate of the region over the last 1.3 My, and shows that the formation of the lake was the result of a dramatic shift in the effective moisture of the region. This shift is associated with a change in the orbital forcing of the climate, which is consistent with the Mid-Pleistocene Transition. The lake level variations are closely linked to the evolution of the cichlid fish species flock, which is one of the most diverse fish communities on Earth. The results presented here provide a unique insight into the evolution of the African Rift System and the formation of Lake Malawi, and the role that climate change played in the diversification of the endemic cichlid fish species flock.

The strongest genetic risk factor influencing susceptibility to AD is the APOE4 allele. APOE is a protein that is produced by astrocytes, a major cell type in the brain. We found that APOE isoform regulates the rate of astrocytic phagocytosis, which is highly dependent on APOE isoform. APOE2 enhances the rate of phagocytosis of synapses by astrocytes, whereas APOE4 decreases it. We also found that the presence of APOE4 increases the accumulation of a complement component in the brain, which may be due to the increased rate of phagocytosis of senescent synapses by astrocytes. These studies suggest that the presence of APOE4 may be due to defective phagocytic capacity of astrocytes, which accelerates the rate of accumulation of senescent synapses, enhancing synaptic vulnerability to complement-mediated neurodegeneration. This hypothesis may help to explain the increased risk of AD associated with the APOE4 allele."

We demonstrate that the xanthocillin BGC is present in a variety of filamentous fungi, and that these metabolites bind copper and impact cellular copper content. The existence of the xanthocillin BGC in several filamentous fungi suggests a heretofore unknown role of eukaryotic natural products in copper homeostasis and mediation of interactions with competing microbes.

We also found that the settlement of Madagascar happened in a sex-biased way, with a higher contribution of males from Southeast Asia and Europe. Finally, we found that the genetic structure of the population is influenced by the geography of the island, suggesting that the settlement of Madagascar happened in a dynamic way.

We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. Our results suggest that behavioral inflexibility is a common feature of autism and that the underlying mechanism is related to the activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting.

This glycan is consumed only at night, when the host and symbiont are in close proximity, and the catabolism of chitin is required for the periodic acidification of the crypts, which enhances the luminescence of the symbiont. This study suggests that the provision of glycans may be a general mechanism for the regulation of the activities of symbionts associated with epithelial surfaces. This idea is supported by the observation that other hosts may similarly regulate the activities of symbionts through the strategic provision of glycans. (Show more)"

We also found that the lesion can be bypassed in two different ways, depending on the location of the alkyl group in the DNA base. This work provides important mechanistic insights into the effects of alkylated DNA lesions on transcription.

In this study, we show that the loss of BMP signaling in the epithelium leads to the development of intestinal tumors, which in turn activate a JNK-dependent feedback loop that triggers a dysbiotic microbiome and tumor growth. Our findings identify a mechanism by which the activity of the epithelium controls the activity of the microbiome, and highlight the importance of controlling the activity of JNK signaling to maintain intestinal barrier function and host–microbe homeostasis. These results have implications for understanding the role of the microbiome in the development of intestinal tumors and for developing strategies to control tumorigenesis. (Show more)"

We show that chemotherapy can increase the expression of the type I tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor ROR1, which is associated with the expression of genes involved in the activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, and BMI1. We also show that ROR1 expression is associated with the development of breast cancer stemness, which is a feature of cancer cells that may contribute to the development of metastasis. Finally, we show that treatment of mice bearing breast cancer patient-derived xenografts with a humanized anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab can reduce the ability of the tumors to metastasize and reestablish engraftment in Rag2−/−γc−/− mice. These results suggest that targeting ROR1 may improve the response to chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer. (Show more)"

This work offers a mechanistic explanation for the effects of these antibodies on the brain, and may lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the effects of other neuropsychiatric drugs. This may also help to explain the wide range of effects that can be seen in patients, and may lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the effects of other neuropsychiatric drugs."

However, the history of carbon perturbation events is poorly understood. Here, we present a detailed study of a carbon perturbation event that occurred during a glacial period. We show that this event was the result of a global warming event that was triggered by the injection of organic matter into the ocean. This event is a key example of the role that organic matter can play in the Earth system and the potential for it to play a role in the climate system today."

In species with a single sex determination locus, the sex of an individual is determined by the same genetic locus that determines the development of the gonads. In species with multiple sex determination alleles, the sex of an individual can be determined by any of the alleles. Here we show that the multiple alleles of sex determination in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii can produce a modular set of secondary sexual characteristics, including differences in the shape of the head and the shape of the genital opening. These results suggest that the multiple alleles of sex determination can produce a greater range of phenotypes, and that the maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles can have a greater impact on the evolution of secondary sexual characteristics than previously thought."

One of these, generated by the oxidation of vitamin A aldehyde adducts, is a product of photooxidation and photodegradation of the pigment melanin. The other, generated by Fenton chemistry, is a product of the photooxidation of the pigment rhodopsin. We show that the levels of iron in the retina, which are known to be important for the metabolism of vitamin A, also play a role in the photodegradation of the pigment rhodopsin. These findings have implications for the health of the retina and the photoreceptors that it contains. (Show more)"

However, the evolution of specialization is often considered a dead end, as predators become more specialized, they become less efficient. Here we show that the evolution of specialization in siphonophores, a group of pelagic cnidarians, is not a dead end, but rather a process that has led to the diversification of prey types. Our results suggest that the evolution of specialization in siphonophores has been shaped by the evolution of morphological innovations, and that these innovations have been linked to the diversification of prey types. Our findings contribute to understanding the evolution of specialization in predators, and the role of morphological evolution in the diversification of food webs."

However, the origins of the distinctive features of the human hand are poorly understood because of the paucity of hand fossils in the hominin fossil record between 800,000 and 1.8 My old. Here we show that the third metacarpal styloid process, a key feature of the modern human hand, was present in a fossil from East Africa that dates to 1.42 My. This fossil thus provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key shared derived characteristic of modern human and Neandertal hand morphology and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo. This finding has implications for the evolution of the human hand and the origins of modern human-like behavior. (Less)"

Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. This work provides a foundation for the development of a new class of cancer therapeutics.

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the discovery of a 100-m-long, 1"
