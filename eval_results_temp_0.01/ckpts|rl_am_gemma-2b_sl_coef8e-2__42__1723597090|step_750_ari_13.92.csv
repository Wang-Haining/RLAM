This result is a step toward a reconstruction of quantum mechanics in terms of continuous functions alone. It also has implications for the foundations of quantum theory.

Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we compare the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species to the genome of a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This transition may have been facilitated by the loss of signaling pathways and transcriptional factors important for multicellular development. These results provide insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Less)"

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to block nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are essential for induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We found that SARS-CoV-2 uses a viral accessory protein, Orf6, to block nuclear import of the cargo-karyopherin complex. We also show that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1, a protein complex that is essential for docking of the cargo-karyopherin complex at the NPC. Our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 evades the host antiviral response and highlights the importance of Nup98-Rae1 in antiviral defense.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 channel. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels."

We find that the probability of simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year increases from 0% to 7% under 2 °C warming and to 86% under 4 °C warming. This study also shows that the coefficient of variation of maize yields increases to values much larger than present-day values, and it underscores the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance."

However, the global load of floating plastic debris is still unknown. We show that the plastic debris is mostly concentrated in the convergence zones of the five subtropical gyres, but the total load is far less than expected. This is due to the selective removal of small plastic fragments by the ocean interior. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

The selectivity filter is the narrowest part of the channel and is responsible for the selective permeation of K+ ions. The selectivity filter is formed by the transmembrane segments 4 and 5 and is highly conserved among potassium channels. The selectivity filter is also the most structurally conserved part of the channel. We have identified a second Threonine residue within the selectivity filter as a crucial residue for the functional and structural coupling between the activation gate and the selectivity filter. This residue is essential for the allosteric communication between the activation gate and the selectivity filter. We have also demonstrated that the collapse of the selectivity filter can be used to achieve closed-state inactivation.

Here we show that anxiety directly influences social dominance in male outbred rats and identify an important mediating role for mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens. High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as increased reactive oxygen species production in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals. We conclude that mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens is crucial for social behavior and is critically involved in the low social competitiveness associated with high anxiety.

In this study, we identified a mechanism of cancer cell resistance to ferroptosis, a form of regulated necrosis driven by iron-dependent peroxidation of phospholipids. This resistance is mediated by activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis, which induces sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. We show that SREBP1 mediates ferroptosis resistance through induction of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), which in turn promotes lipid biosynthesis.

This problem can be addressed by the development of new antibacterial agents to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. In this study, we present a rational design approach to identify new acylide antibiotics. The design strategy is based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess the performance of the design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. The design strategy can be used to develop new antibiotics to combat antibiotic resistance. This approach can be extended to other antibiotic classes. (Simplified version available at DOI)"

However, the number of trainable parameters in these networks can be large, and the number of trainable parameters is a critical factor in determining the accuracy of the network and the number of parameters that can be trained in a reasonable amount of time. Here, we introduce a network architecture that is able to achieve accurate results with a small number of trainable parameters. The architecture is based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters, and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice. We show that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data. The proposed architecture is also easier to implement and train than popular existing architectures. We believe that the proposed architecture will be useful for researchers and practitioners in the field of image processing."

However, in contrast to congenital deficiency, this was not fatal. CTLA-4 deletion induced preferential expansion of CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells. However, T cells from CTLA-4–deficient inducible KO mice were able to adoptively transfer the diseases into T cell-deficient mice.

It is the only island in the world where the Austronesian and Bantu populations are found together. We used a grid-based approach to sample the genomic diversity across Madagascar. We find that the Austronesian and Bantu populations are closely related and that the island was colonized by both populations. We also find that the population structure is not only driven by admixture but also by the geography of the island. This suggests that the colonization of Madagascar was not homogeneous and that the population structure is a result of a combination of processes. Our results provide a better understanding of the settlement history of Madagascar. They also provide a framework to study the genetic diversity of other islands.

These results are supported further by an extensive survey of faunal remains from 234 sites in the Southern Levant, spanning more than three millennia. We argue that the earliest secure evidence for economic exploitation of chickens in Europe dates to the first century B.C.E. and therefore is predated by the finds in the Southern Levant by at least a century.

However, it is difficult to be well represented in current climate models. This is due to the complexity of ACI processes, such as the influence of aerosols on water cloud droplet formation. To overcome this conundrum, we introduce the dual-field-of-view (FOV) high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) for simultaneously profiling aerosol and water cloud properties, especially water cloud microphysical properties. This instrument is expected to become a significant contributor to the ACI investigations. The observed water cloud profiles identify that due to air entrainment its vertical structure is not perfectly adiabatic, as assumed by many current retrieval methods. Our ACI analysis shows increased aerosol loading led to increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius—consistent with expectations—but had no discernible increase on liquid water path. This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations obtained from the dual-FOV HSRL constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI process. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI."

Here, we show that the red color of the nectar of Nesocodon mauritianus is derived from a previously undescribed alkaloid. We identify three enzymes that are necessary or sufficient for the production of the red pigment. We also identify the red nectar of Jaltomata herrerae as a convergent adaptation to hummingbird pollination.

To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions. Our findings are important for understanding the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and for developing countermeasures against future bat coronavirus-mediated outbreaks.

In the laboratory, RNA molecules can be replicated by RNA polymerases, but these are proteins. Here, we describe the development of an RNA polymerase ribozyme that can replicate RNA molecules in the absence of proteins. This polymerase can replicate RNA templates to completion, and can amplify short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins.

Our analysis reveals that soil respiration rates increase with soil temperature up to a threshold of ∼25 °C, above which respiration rates decrease with further increases in temperature. This consistent decrease in temperature sensitivity at higher temperatures demonstrates that rising global temperatures may result in regionally variable responses in soil respiration, with colder climates being considerably more responsive to increased ambient temperatures compared with warmer regions.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a molecular mechanism for autism and a potential target for drug development. It also provides a generalizable approach for identifying the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms. This approach can be applied to other complex disorders with a multifactorial etiology."

Results offer the most comprehensive cross-national demonstration of negativity biases to date, but they also serve to highlight considerable individual-level variation in responsiveness to news content. Insofar as our results make clear the pervasiveness of negativity biases on average, they help account for the tendency for audience-seeking news around the world to be predominantly negative. Insofar as our results highlight individual-level variation, however, they highlight the potential for more positive content, and suggest that there may be reason to reconsider the conventional journalistic wisdom that “if it bleeds, it leads.”"

This protein, which we named Myotis pilosus-specific immunosuppressant (MTX), selectively inhibits the epoxide hydrolase function of leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) to inhibit LTA4 hydrolysis and the generation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a potent lipid chemoattractant for host defense against infection.

To better understand how sequential proteolysis contributes to MERS-CoV infection, we introduced mutations that blocked the first S protein cleavages. These mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses were more infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they had sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S protein cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence."

Herein, using global STING knockout (STING−/−) and β-cell–specific STING knockout (STING-βKO) mouse models, we revealed a distinct role of STING in the regulation of glucose homeostasis through peripheral tissues and β-cells. Specially, although STING beneficially alleviated insulin resistance and glucose intolerance induced by high-fat diet, it surprisingly impaired islet glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS).

In bacteria, the most studied RNA modification is the addition of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to transfer RNAs. Here we report the discovery of a 5′ nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) RNA in eukaryotes. We show that this 5′ modification is found on subsets of nuclear and mitochondrial encoded mRNAs in yeast. We also show that this modification is produced cotranscriptionally, suggesting that it may play a role in regulating gene expression. This discovery of a 5′ NAD+ cap in eukaryotes raises the possibility that this modification could modulate RNA stability and translation on specific subclasses of mRNAs. This could have important implications for understanding the function of this modification in cells."

Fibrous sheath interacting protein 1 (FSIP1) is a cancer antigen expressed in the majority of TNBCs and is associated with poor prognosis. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. (Show more)"

Here, we show that striatonigral fibers originating in striosomes form highly unusual bouquet-like arborizations that target bundles of ventrally extending dopamine-containing dendrites and clusters of their parent nigral cell bodies. These clustered cell bodies in turn project to the striatum as part of the classic nigrostriatal pathway. Thus, these striosome–dendron bouquets likely represent subsystems with the nigro–striato–nigral loop that are affected in human disorders including Parkinson’s disease. Given evidence that striosomes receive input from cortical regions related to the control of mood and motivation and that they link functionally to reinforcement and decision-making, the striosome–dendron bouquets could be critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease. This work provides a unique view of the dopamine-containing nigral system and its connections.

But how do we know when two people are connected? We asked people to talk with each other and rated their felt connection. We found that the speed at which people responded to each other was a robust predictor of felt connection. People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

The latter is also challenged by the accumulation of lipid-derived reactive oxygen species-generating species that are photogenerated by the pigment epithelium. We sought to understand how the levels of iron (Fe) impact the retina, given that Fe is a key component of both ROS sources. We found that Fe levels impact the retina by influencing the levels of lipid-derived reactive oxygen species-generating species. These findings have implications for the understanding of retinal disease and for the development of therapeutic strategies. (PsycINFO Database Record"

However, the evolution of specialization is often considered a dead end, as morphological and functional optimizations are expected to occur throughout the organism. Here we show that siphonophores, a group of pelagic colonial cnidarians, have evolved modularity in their predatory structures, and that these structures have strong evolutionary associations with prey type. Our findings suggest that specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs, and that specialization can be maintained in the face of morphological change. These findings contribute to understanding how specialization has shaped present-day food webs."

The study of the hominin hand fossil record has been hampered by the paucity of hand fossils in the hominin record between 800,000 and 1.8 My old. Here we report the discovery of a hominin hand fossil from the Middle Pleistocene to recent period that preserves a key derived feature of the human hand, the third metacarpal styloid process. This fossil provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of this key derived feature of the human hand. The discovery of this fossil also suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato. This study highlights the importance of the study of the hominin fossil record in the early Pleistocene. (Less)"

The enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) converts serine into glycine and a folate-bound one-carbon unit. In mammals, there are two SHMT isozymes, one in the cytosol and one in the mitochondria. Here we show that dual knockout of SHMT1 and SHMT2 blocks tumor growth in a colon cancer xenograft model. We also identify small-molecule dual inhibitors of SHMT1 and SHMT2, which are effective in cancer cells. Finally, we show that one-carbon donor formate is a potent inhibitor of SHMT, and that DLBCL cells are uniquely dependent upon SHMT enzymatic activity to meet glycine demand. Thus, formate is a targetable metabolic deficiency of DLBCL. These studies provide a foundation for the development of small-molecule inhibitors of SHMT1/2. Such inhibitors may be useful in cancer therapy. They may also be useful in the treatment of other diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders."

This study shows that deforestation can reduce people’s consumption of fruits and vegetables and thus their vitamin A intake. Conversely, forest fragmentation can increase consumption of fruits and vegetables and thus vitamin A intake. These findings have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. This study also highlights the importance of using causal inference methods to understand the effects of deforestation on people’s diets. This is a relatively new field of research and one that is likely to become increasingly important in the future."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the discovery of a"
