In this work, we report the synthesis and structure of a hydrate, neon hydrate, which is a new phase of ice II. The structure of neon hydrate is determined by neutron diffraction. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The resolved structure where Ne dissolved in ice II is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. The density distributions indicate that the vibration of Ne atoms is mainly in planes perpendicular to D2O channels, whereas their distributions along the channels are further constrained by interactions between adjacent Ne atoms. The results provide a new perspective for the structure of ice II. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, and a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we report the genomes of two distantly related species of myxozoans, which are remarkably similar to the genomes of cnidarians. Our results suggest that the extreme reduction in genome size and gene content in the Myxozoa was accompanied by a reduction in the complexity of the body plan. This evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic cnidarian may have been accompanied by a reduction in the complexity of the nervous system and other signaling pathways. These results have important implications for understanding the evolution of the Myxozoa and the origin of parasitism in animals. (Show more)"

The virus responsible for this disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is able to evade the antiviral action of the immune system by blocking interferon (IFN)-mediated signaling. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We found that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This mechanism may be used by other viruses as"

Zinc is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of zinc inhibition of the Hv1 channel. We find that zinc binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the zinc-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how zinc inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

Earlier studies suggest that once the optimum growing temperature is exceeded, mean crop yields decline and the variability of yield increases even if interannual climate variability remains unchanged. Here, we use global datasets of maize production and climate variability combined with future temperature projections to quantify how yield variability will change in the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. We find that as the global mean temperature increases, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation (CV) of maize yields increases almost everywhere to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation (SD) of yields and a decrease in mean yields. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. They also underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat"

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species of African LMH. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers. Grass consumption was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of % grass consumption, indicating that RRA conveys reliable quantitative information about consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This study highlights the importance of diet in the study of LMH ecology and conservation. (Less)"

However, the magnitude of the problem is still unclear. We show that the global load of plastic on the open ocean surface is far less than expected. This is due to the selective removal of small plastic fragments by food webs and ballasting processes. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

Computational approaches are essential tools to this end since their application enables fast and early strategical decisions in the drug development process. Here, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

To achieve accurate results in practice, a large number of trainable parameters are often required. Here, we introduce a network architecture based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice, and automatically adapts to different problems. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data."

Remarkably, we observe that filament segments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist, experience a mechanical torque upon ADF binding. We find that this ADF-induced torque increases the severing rate constant 100-fold. A simple model, which faithfully recapitulates our experimental observations, indicates that the ADF-induced torque is critical to boost ADF’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. We propose that this mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. This mechanism may be critical to many cellular processes, including cytokinesis and cell motility. This mechanism may be critical to many cellular processes, including cytokinesis"

We used a grid-based approach to sample the genomic diversity across the island, from the north to the south. We find a common Bantu and Austronesian descent for all Malagasy individuals, with a limited paternal contribution from Europe and the Middle East. Admixture and demographic growth happened recently, suggesting a rapid settlement of Madagascar during the last millennium. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the settlement was not homogeneous, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population.

Here we demonstrate that the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa detects contact with surfaces on short timescales using the mechanical activity of its type IV pili, a major surface adhesin. This signal transduction mechanism requires attachment of type IV pili to a solid surface, followed by pilus retraction and signal transduction through the Chp chemosensory system, a chemotaxis-like sensory system that regulates cAMP production and transcription of hundreds of genes, including key virulence factors. These findings demonstrate that P. aeruginosa not only uses type IV pili for surface-specific twitching motility, but also as a sensor regulating surface-induced gene expression and pathogenicity.

However, the ACI is difficult to be well represented in current climate models. This is due to the lack of observational capability. Here, we introduce a new instrument, the dual-field-of-view high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL), to observe aerosols and clouds simultaneously. This instrument is capable of providing high-resolution and simultaneous observations of aerosols and clouds, especially water cloud microphysical properties. We use this instrument to investigate the interactions between aerosol loading and water cloud microphysical properties. The observations show that increased aerosol loading led to increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius. This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI. (Less)"

The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We hypothesized that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We induced C-type inactivation in BK channels and studied the relationship between activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery. We observed prominent slow C-type inactivation/recovery in BK channels by an extreme low concentration of extracellular K+ together with a Y294E/K/Q/S or Y279F mutation whose equivalent in Shaker channels (T449E/K/D/Q/S or W434F) caused a greatly accelerated rate of C-inactivation or constitutive C-inactivation.

In the temperate regions, seasonal influenza outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in ambient humidity. While low ambient humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes them more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the impact of low ambient humidity on influenza virus infection and disease outcome, and suggest that low humidity may be a modifiable risk factor for influenza-associated morbidity and mortality.

This could be up to 5.55 million per year by additionally controlling nonfossil anthropogenic sources. Globally, fossil-fuel-related emissions account for about 65% of the excess mortality, and 70% of the climate cooling by anthropogenic aerosols. The chemical influence of air pollution on aeolian dust contributes to the aerosol cooling. Since aerosols mask the anthropogenic rise in global temperature, removing fossil-fuel-generated particles liberates 0.51 °C and all pollution particles 0.73 °C warming, reaching around 2 °C over North America and Northeast Asia. We conclude that a rapid phaseout of fossil-fuel-related emissions and major reductions of other anthropogenic sources are needed to save millions of lives, restore aerosol-perturbed rainfall patterns, and limit global warming to 2 °C."

We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions. (Show more)"

We identified a variety of vector-borne, zoonotic, and emerging pathogens, including chikungunya virus, which presaged a larger national outbreak. Our findings highlight the feasibility of pathogen surveillance using metagenomic next-generation sequencing in resource-scarce settings and the importance of coordinated and ongoing pathogen surveillance to better identify the breadth of endemic, zoonotic, or emerging pathogens.

The synthesis of these fragments is catalyzed by DNA polymerases that require the sliding clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) to maintain processivity and stability. In this study, we developed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the human pol δ holoenzyme. We found that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This study provides a unique perspective on the structure and function of the pol δ holoenzyme and its implications for DNA replication. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

In the laboratory, RNA molecules can be replicated by RNA polymerases, but the activity of RNA polymerases is limited to a few specific reactions. Here, we report the in vitro evolution of an RNA polymerase ribozyme that can synthesize a variety of RNA molecules, including aptamers, ribozymes, and, in low yield, even tRNA. The polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA.

First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology.

We show that changes in human demography, rather than climate, have been the dominant driver of global fire activity over the past century. This has led to a warming of the climate, but recent and predicted future reductions in fire activity may reverse this, enhancing land carbon uptake and corresponding to offsetting ∼5 to 10 y of global CO2 emissions at today’s levels. We show that ignitions and active and passive fire suppression can be as important in driving future fire regimes as changes in climate, although with some risk of more extreme fires regionally and with implications for other ecosystem functions in fire-dependent ecosystems. Our study highlights the importance of human activities in driving fire regimes and the need to consider the effects of fire on climate in the context of climate change."

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation. This demonstrates that the translation and base-pairing functions compete. These findings provide insight into the dual functions of sRNAs and the evolution of dual-function RNAs.

However, the factors that contribute to virus spillover from bats are still largely unknown. Here, we identified and characterized a protein (MTX) that is highly concentrated in the submandibular salivary gland of the bat, Myotis pilosus. MTX selectively inhibits the leukotriene-A4 hydrolase function of leukotriene-A4 hydrolase to inhibit leukotriene B4 generation, a potent lipid chemoattractant for host defense against infection. MTX potently inhibits proinflammatory proteases to induce immune tolerance and maintain high stability. In mouse models, influenza A virus infection and pathogenicity were exacerbated by MTX but were reversed by interfering with the effects of MTX on leukotriene-A4 hydrolase or exogenous leukotriene B4 administration. This study provides deeper insight into immunologically privileged sites for microbial community residence in bats and supports the therapeutic potential of targeting MTX-leukotriene-A4 hydrolase. This study also provides a potential mechanism for the emergence of influenza A virus. (Show more)"

Here, we show that the proteins that are part of the inclusions in the brain and spinal cord of patients with ALS are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. To explain the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in the brain and spinal cord, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. This finding may have implications for the development of therapeutic strategies for ALS. (PsycINFO Database Record"

In coordination with endogenous FOXC2 in fibroblasts, transduced ETV2 induces expression of multiple key endothelial development factors, including FLI1, ERG, and TAL1, and induces expression of endothelial functional molecules, including EGFL7 and von Willebrand factor. Consequently, ETVECs exhibits EC characteristics in vitro and forms mature functional vasculature in Matrigel plugs transplanted in NOD SCID mice. Furthermore, ETVECs significantly improve blood flow recovery in a hind limb ischemic model using BALB/c-nu mice.

Accumulating evidence indicates that STING plays an important role in the regulation of insulin sensitivity. However, its function in β-cells remains unknown. Herein, we revealed a distinct role of STING in the regulation of glucose homeostasis through peripheral tissues and β-cells. Specially, although STING deficiency alleviated insulin resistance and glucose intolerance induced by high-fat diet, it surprisingly impaired insulin secretion from β-cells. Importantly, STING is decreased in islets of db/db mice and patients with T2D, suggesting a possible role of STING in β-cell dysfunction. Indeed, STING-βKO caused glucose intolerance due to impaired insulin secretion, indicating that STING is required for normal β-cell function. These data revealed a function of STING in the regulation of insulin secretion and established pathophysiological significance of fine-tuned STING within β-cells and insulin target tissues for maintaining glucose homeostasis.

The genome of the influenza A virus is segmented into eight fragments, which complicates genomic packaging. The existence of a selective packaging mechanism, in which one copy of each viral RNA is specifically packaged into each virion, is suspected, but its molecular details remain unknown. Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus. This interaction takes place in infected cells and is required for optimal viral replication. Disruption of this interaction nonspecifically decreased the amount of viral RNA in the viral particles, resulting in an eightfold increase in empty viral particles. This interaction might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses. The lack of conservation of this interaction might limit the ability of influenza A viruses to adapt to new hosts. (Show more)"

However, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Here, we show that the metabolic state of the coral host is a key factor in the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis. We demonstrate that the catabolism of amino acids in the coral holobiont is a major driver of the functional breakdown of the symbiosis. This process is driven by the metabolic energy demand of the coral host, which is increased by heat stress. The resulting shift from net uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont subsequently promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host. This provides a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa.

Here, we used a portable two-photon microscope to examine the topographic arrangement of these cells in the superficial layers of MEC and adjacent parasubiculum during unrestrained behavior. Our data suggest that grid cell networks might be largely distinct from those of border, HD, and OV cells and that grid cells exhibit strong coupling among themselves but weaker links to other cell types. These findings have implications for understanding the function of MEC in spatial navigation. (Show more)"

But how do we know when two people are connected? We asked pairs of friends and strangers to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Finally, we demonstrate that this signal is used by third-party listeners as a heuristic of how well people are connected: Conversations with faster response times were perceived as more connected than the same conversations with slower response times. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

Here, we report that stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is a key regulator of SAN function. Cardiac-specific deletion of STIM1 in mice resulted in depletion of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ stores of SAN cells and led to SAN dysfunction, as was evident by a reduction in heart rate, sinus arrest, and an exaggerated autonomic response to cholinergic signaling. Moreover, STIM1 influenced SAN function by regulating ionic fluxes in SAN cells, including activation of a store-operated Ca2+ current, a reduction in L-type Ca2+ current, and enhancing the activities of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. These studies reveal that STIM1 is a multifunctional regulator of Ca2+ dynamics in SAN cells that links SR Ca2+ store content with electrical events occurring in the plasma membrane, thereby contributing to automaticity of the SAN.

However, the effect of certification on deforestation in oil palm plantations remains unclear. Here, we show that certification is associated with reduced deforestation in Indonesia, the leading producer of palm oil. Nevertheless, most plantations contained little residual forest when they received certification. As a result, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation."

We show here that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants."
