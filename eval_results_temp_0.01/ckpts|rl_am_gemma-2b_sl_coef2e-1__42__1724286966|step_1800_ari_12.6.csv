Here, we report the genomes of two distantly related myxozoans, Kudoa iwatai and Myxobolus cerebralis, and compare them to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results show that the myxozoan genome is one of the smallest reported in animals and that the parasite has lost many genes involved in development and cell–cell communication. These findings suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by a reduction in genome size and gene content. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the myxozoan transition to parasitism was accompanied by a major evolutionary event in the history of animal evolution. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that the accessory protein Orf6 of SARS-CoV-2 is able to block nuclear import of IFN-stimulated factors (ISFs) and thereby impair the antiviral transcriptional response. We found that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain. This interaction is required for the viral antagonism of IFN. Our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. Our findings provide a mechanistic understanding of the viral antagonism of IFN and may lead to the development of new strategies to combat COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of proton channels, but the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

We use global datasets of maize production and climate variability to quantify how maize yields will change in the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. We find that the probability that they have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because of the difficulty of species-level identification of plant remains in traditional studies. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammal species in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our findings have implications for understanding the role of LMH in the maintenance of biodiversity in African savannas. (Show more)"

However, its global distribution and fate in the ocean are still unknown. We show that the global load of floating plastic debris is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This is due to the size-selective sinks of floating plastic debris in the ocean interior. These sinks are likely to be related to the fast nano-fragmentation of the plastic debris into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. The global distribution of floating plastic debris is mostly related to the convergence zones of the five subtropical gyres. This distribution is a consequence of the global distribution of the plastic sources."

This process promotes vascular remodeling and may contribute to the development of heart failure in patients with hypertension. Our findings may help to explain the association of LCCBs with heart failure and may lead to the development of new strategies to reduce the risk of heart failure in patients with hypertension."

We show that the Osmium isotope ratios of magnetic grains and microspherules from the YDB sites are similar to average upper continental crust, indicating a terrestrial origin of Os in these samples. In contrast, the Osmium isotope ratios of bulk sediments from YDB sites in Belgium and Pennsylvania suggest mixing with extraterrestrial Os, but the Os in these samples is likely terrestrially derived. The rare earth element patterns and Sr and Nd isotopes of spherules from the YDB site in Pennsylvania indicate that their source lies in 1.5-Ga Quebecia terrain in the Grenville Province of northeastern North America.

Here, we show that the early death of CTLA-4 knockout mice is not due to the absence of autoimmunity, but rather to the development of a spontaneous lymphoproliferation, hypergammaglobulinemia, and histologically evident pneumonitis, gastritis, insulitis, and sialadenitis. This was not fatal, but led to a severe disease phenotype. CTLA-4 deletion induced preferential expansion of CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells, but T cells from CTLA-4–deficient inducible KO mice were able to adoptively transfer the diseases into T cell-deficient mice. This indicates that CTLA-4 deficiency affects both central and peripheral tolerance and Treg cell-mediated suppression. Thus, CTLA-4 is a central regulator of immune responses and its function is not restricted to the periphery. This study provides a better understanding of the role of CTLA-4 in the development of autoimmunity. It also provides a model for the study of the role of CTLA-4 in the development of autoimmunity."

This study provides a more accurate picture of the evolution of brain neuronal density and its relationship with brain size. It also has important implications for studies using relative brain size as a proxy when looking for evolutionary drivers of animal cognition."

However, the function of TRAP1 in normal cells is not well understood. We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. Thus, TRAP1 may be a promising target for cancer therapy. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc."

They are also the main components of many cellular processes, such as cell migration and cell division. In these processes, the filaments are often connected to each other, and they are under mechanical stress. We show that the proteins of the actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin family are the central regulators of actin filament disassembly. We show that they do so by severing the filaments. We show that the severing is enhanced by a mechanical torque that is induced by the proteins upon binding to the filaments. This mechanism is critical to boost ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. We believe that it is a general mechanism that is used by many proteins to enhance their ability to sever their substrates."

The HSRL can simultaneously measure aerosol and cloud properties, especially cloud microphysical properties. We demonstrate the scientific potential of the HSRL to contribute to the understanding of ACI.

They open and close their pore gates to allow or block ion flow. K+ channels commonly possess two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. These findings provide insights into the mechanism of K+ channel gating and C-type inactivation. They also provide a basis for the development of new K+ channel blockers and activators. (Show more)"

In the temperate regions, seasonal outbreaks of influenza virus correlate with decreases in ambient humidity. The impact of humidity on host defense against influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that mice housed in low humidity condition are more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

The auditory organs of animals are diverse in anatomy and morphology, but all are part of the animal’s body. Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. The web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to capture the sound-induced air particle movements that approach the maximum physical efficiency better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself. The spider also enables the flexibility to functionally adjust and regularly regenerate its external ""eardrum"" according to its needs. The outsourcing and supersizing of auditory function in spiders provide unique features for studying extended and regenerative sensing and designing novel acoustic flow detectors for precise fluid dynamic measurement and manipulation.

However, the processes that led to the current genetic structure are not fully understood. Here we present a case study of a group of women who were deformed by cranial cranial deformation. We show that they had a very high genetic heterogeneity, including signals of ancestry from western Europe to East Asia. In addition, we show that they also differed in visible characteristics. This example of female-biased migration indicates that complex demographic processes during the Early Medieval period may have contributed in an unexpected way to shape the modern European genetic landscape."

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how HKU4 and HKU5 transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions. Our findings provide insights into the evolution of MERS-CoV and the potential risk of HKU4 and HKU5 for human infections. They also"

In resource-scarce settings, where outbreaks are likely to emerge, laboratory diagnostics and bioinformatics capacity are limited. We used metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) to investigate the regional pathogen landscape and surveillance of emerging pathogens in a periurban population in Cambodia. We identified a variety of vector-borne, zoonotic, and emerging pathogens responsible for undifferentiated fevers. Early detection of chikungunya virus presaged a larger national outbreak of more than 6,000 cases. Pathogen-agnostic mNGS investigation of febrile persons in resource-scarce Southeast Asia is feasible and revealing of a diverse pathogen landscape. Coordinated and ongoing mNGS pathogen surveillance can better identify the breadth of endemic, zoonotic, or emerging pathogens and deployment of rapid public health response.

The lagging strand of the DNA double helix is replicated by the polymerase δ (pol δ) holoenzyme, which is responsible for the faithful replication of every nucleobase. The stability of this complex is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. In this study, we show that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with the PCNA sliding clamp while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion.

In this paper, we introduce a computer vision method to measure changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods from time-series street-level imagery. We connect changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods with economic and demographic data and find that three factors predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities. Our method can be used to study other urban processes, such as gentrification and urban decay.

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

We find that precipitation deficits in California were more than twice as likely to yield drought years if they occurred when conditions were warm. We also find that although there has not been a substantial change in the probability of either negative or moderately negative precipitation anomalies in recent decades, the occurrence of drought years has been greater in the past two decades than in the preceding century. In addition, the probability that precipitation deficits co-occur with warm conditions and the probability that precipitation deficits produce drought have both increased.

The etiology of autism is so complicated because it involves the effects of variants of several hundred risk genes along with the contribution of environmental factors. Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility in autism and may facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies.

In this study, we use a fluorescently tagged polyglutamine-expanded form of human huntingtin to monitor the spreading of aggregates in the Drosophila brain. We show that aggregates accumulate at synaptic terminals and progressively spread throughout the brain. These aggregates are internalized and accumulate within other neurons. We demonstrate that the release of aggregates requires N-ethylmalemide–sensitive fusion protein 1, indicating that active release and uptake of aggregates are important elements of spreading and disease progression. These findings provide a model for the study of spreading neurodegenerative diseases and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies. (Show more)"

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas the more rigid uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into"

However, the minimum number of transcription factors that are required to induce EC development remains undefined. Here, we demonstrate that ets variant 2 (ETV2) alone can induce the formation of functional vascular ECs (ETVECs) from human adult skin fibroblasts. In addition, ETVECs can form mature functional vasculature in Matrigel plugs transplanted in NOD SCID mice. Furthermore, ETVECs significantly improve blood flow recovery in a hind limb ischemic model using BALB/c-nu mice. Our study indicates that the creation of ETVECs provides further understanding of human EC development induced by ETV2. This approach may be useful for the treatment of vascular disorders.

Herein, we found that STING is required for normal β-cell function and is decreased in islets of db/db mice and patients with T2D. STING deficiency decreased expression of β-cell function–related genes, including Glut2, Kcnj11, and Abcc8, contributing to impaired GSIS. Mechanistically, the transcription factor Pax6 was down-regulated and its nuclear localization was lost in STING-βKO β-cells. These data revealed a function of STING in the regulation of insulin secretion and established pathophysiological significance of fine-tuned STING within β-cells and insulin target tissues for maintaining glucose homeostasis.

Their genome is segmented into eight RNA fragments, which offers evolutionary advantages but complicates genomic packaging. The existence of a selective packaging mechanism, in which one copy of each viral RNA is specifically packaged into each virion, is suspected, but its molecular details remain unknown. Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus using in vitro experiments. Using silent trans-complementary mutants, we then demonstrated that this interaction takes place in infected cells and is required for optimal viral replication. Disruption of this interaction did not affect the HA titer of the mutant viruses, suggesting that the same amount of viral particles was produced. However, it nonspecifically decreased the amount of viral RNA in the viral particles, resulting in an eightfold increase in empty viral particles. Our experiments indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions. The lack of conservation of these interactions might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses. (Show more)"

However, the economic and ecological costs of wildfire have risen dramatically in recent decades. Climate change has likely contributed to the increase in wildfire activity, but the direct role of people in increasing wildfire activity has been largely overlooked. We show that humans have vastly expanded the spatial and seasonal “fire niche” in the United States, accounting for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. Human-caused wildfires disproportionally occurred where fuel moisture was higher than lightning-caused fires, thereby helping expand the geographic and seasonal niche of wildfire. Actions to raise awareness and increase management in regions prone to human-started wildfires should be a focus of United States policy to reduce fire risk and associated hazards."

In this paper, we introduce a computer vision method to measure changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods from time-series street-level imagery. We connect changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods with economic and demographic data and find that three factors predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

However, these factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning becomes increasingly steep, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. Our findings have important implications for the design of conservation and management strategies. They also highlight the need for a more holistic approach to the study of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Here, we used a portable two-photon microscope to record the activity of neurons in MEC during free-running behavior. We found that grid cells are strongly coupled among themselves, but have weaker links to other cell types.

We demonstrate that striatonigral fibers originating in striosomes form highly unusual bouquet-like arborizations that target bundles of ventrally extending dopamine-containing dendrites and clusters of their parent nigral cell bodies. These clustered cell bodies in turn project to the striatum as part of the classic nigrostriatal pathway. Thus, these striosome–dendron bouquets likely represent subsystems with the nigro–striato–nigral loop that are affected in human disorders including Parkinson’s disease. Given evidence that striosomes receive input from cortical regions related to the control of mood and motivation and that they link functionally to reinforcement and decision-making, the striosome–dendron bouquets could be critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease.

We show that the increase in vehicle weight has led to the propagation of compaction into deeper soil layers, with a significant risk of ecological damage. We also show that the total weight of modern farm machinery is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods. This suggests that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles. We hypothesize that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. This would have the potential to improve the sustainability of modern agriculture. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
