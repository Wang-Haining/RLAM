The foundations of quantum theory are the subject of a lively debate. The most common approach is to use the language of analysis, and to assume that the objects of quantum theory, such as states and observables, are continuous functions from a suitable space of states or observables to a suitable space of complex numbers. We provide a different approach, based on category theory, which does not assume that the objects of quantum theory are continuous. We show that the category of quantum states is equivalent to the category of continuous linear functionals on a suitable space of operators. This approach has the advantage that it is purely categorical, and does not presuppose any analytical structure."

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. Sperm cells are quiescent in the male reproductive system due to Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1 channels, but become active once introduced into the low-Zn2+-concentration environment of the female reproductive tract. How Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide"

We find that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields will increase to values much larger than present-day values, and the probability of simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year will increase substantially. These results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes."

However, the magnitude of the problem is still unknown. We show that the global load of plastic on the open ocean surface is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This is due to size-selective sinks, which remove millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean. View Full-Text"

They are involved in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes. The selectivity filter and the activation gate are functionally and structurally coupled, and an allosteric coupling underlies C-type inactivation coupled to activation gating in this ion-channel family. We have identified the second Threonine residue within the TTVGYGD signature sequence of K+ channels as a crucial residue for this allosteric communication. We show that this residue is essential for the structural collapse of the channel’s selectivity filter on activation. Finally, we provide a crystallographic demonstration that closed-state inactivation can be achieved by the structural collapse of the channel’s selectivity filter. These results provide a structural basis for the functional coupling between the activation gate and the selectivity filter.

In this study, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. Our results provide a proof of concept for the use of computational approaches in the design of new antibiotics. View Full-Text"

The strongest genetic risk factor influencing susceptibility to AD is apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. APOE has three common isoforms in humans, E2, E3, and E4. The presence of two copies of the E4 allele increases risk by ∼12-fold whereas E2 allele is associated with an ∼twofold decreased risk for AD. These data put APOE central to AD pathophysiology, but it is not yet clear how APOE alleles modify AD risk. Here, we report a novel role for APOE in controlling the phagocytic capacity of astrocytes that is highly dependent on APOE isoform. They also suggest the hypothesis that AD susceptibility of APOE4 may originate in part from defective phagocytic capacity of astrocytes which accelerates the rate of accumulation of C1q-coated senescent synapses, enhancing synaptic vulnerability to classical-complement-cascade mediated neurodegeneration. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the role of APOE in AD pathogenesis and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for AD. This article is protected by copyright"

Our results provide a classification theory of conditions under which stable NNs can be computed by an algorithm.

The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel is a type-3 channel that is normally open and inactivated by slow C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. This study provides a new perspective on the regulation of ion channels. It also provides a new target for the development of drugs and gene therapy. (Read more)"

The parasite, Plasmodium, uses a number of mechanisms to invade the red blood cell (RBC) and cause disease. Here, we show that the parasite erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 (EBA175) alters the biophysical properties of the RBC, reducing the energy barrier to invasion. This finding suggests that the malaria parasite primes the RBC surface through its binding antigens, altering the biophysical nature of the target cell and thus reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion. This is a major change in our understanding of malaria parasite invasion, suggesting it is, in fact, a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces working together to facilitate entry. This work provides a new perspective on the invasion process and opens up new avenues for the development of new therapeutic strategies. (Read more)"

In temperate regions, seasonal outbreaks of influenza correlate with decreases in ambient humidity. However, the impact of humidity on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide insights into the impact of low humidity on host defense against influenza virus infection and disease outcome, and may contribute to the development of strategies to mitigate the impact of influenza in low humidity conditions.

We show here that differential regulation of the two genes on the transcriptional and proteostatic level confers differential responsiveness that can be used in tissue-specific regulation. Such subtle features may distinguish other redundant gene pairs that are commonly found in vertebrates through gene knockout experiments.

Here, we show that monoclonal antibodies targeting interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. (PsycINFO Database Record"

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete. These findings provide insight into the regulation of carbon"

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility in autism and suggest that the activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting is a potential therapeutic target for autism. This study also provides a model system for understanding the role of forgetting in learning and memory. (PsycINFO Database Record"

We found that the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion. For the N3-EtdT lesion that disrupts base pairing, multiple transcriptional lesion bypass routes were found. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop).

To better understand the mechanisms of MERS-CoV infection, we engineered viruses with mutations that blocked the sequential proteolysis required for virus entry. These mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence. These findings may also be relevant to the pathogenesis of other viruses that require sequential proteolysis for infection. (Read more)"

The current outbreak has led to a global concern for the safety of pregnant women. Here we present a mathematical model of ZIKV infection in a nonhuman primate model, allowing for characterization of the growth and clearance of ZIKV within individual animals. We estimate that the time between infection and the onset of symptoms is ∼10 d, the time between cell infection and viral production is most likely short (∼4 h), the within-host basic reproductive number R0 is 10.7, the rate of viral production is rapid (&gt;25,000 virions d−1), and the lifetime of an infected cell while producing virus is ∼5 h. We also estimate that the minimum number of virions produced by an infected cell over its lifetime is ∼5,500. We assess the potential effect of an antiviral treatment that blocks viral replication, showing that the median time to undetectable plasma viral load can be reduced from ∼5 d to ∼3 d with a drug concentration ∼15 times the drug’s EC5"

The underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Here, we show that the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis is driven by altered nutrient cycling during heat stress. This shift from nutrient uptake to release by the coral host promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host. This study provides a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

It regulates the absorption of nutrients, mounts immune responses, and prevents systemic infections. In this study, we show that the loss of BMP signaling in the epithelium leads to the development of intestinal tumors, which in turn trigger a regenerative response in the microbiome and stimulate tumor growth. Our results identify a JNK-dependent feedback amplification loop between intestinal tumors and the microbiome. They also highlight the importance of controlling the activity level of JNK signaling to maintain epithelial barrier function and host–microbe homeostasis. Our findings have implications for understanding the role of the microbiome in tumorigenesis and for the development of therapeutic strategies to control tumor growth. They also provide a model system for studying the role of the microbiome in intestinal homeostasis and regeneration. This model could be used to study the role of the microbiome in the development of other diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease. Finally, our findings could lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment."

We also show that treatment of mice bearing breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) with the humanized anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab repressed expression of genes associated with breast cancer stemness, reduced activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or BMI1, and impaired the capacity of breast cancer PDXs to metastasize or reengraft Rag2−/−γc−/− mice. Finally, treatment of PDX-bearing mice with cirmtuzumab and paclitaxel was more effective than treatment with either alone in eradicating breast cancer PDXs."

This discovery provides a powerful platform for the discovery of genes that control the intrinsic regenerative capacity of the adult nervous system. Moreover, our study suggests that the mammalian CNS may be more plastic than previously thought, and that the ability to regenerate may be more widespread than previously appreciated."

However, the delivery of biomolecules to plants is a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate that DNA nanostructures can be used to deliver biomolecules to plants, which is a major advance in the field of plant biology. We also show that the internalization efficiency of DNA nanostructures correlates with their respective gene silencing efficiencies but that the endogenous gene silencing pathway depends on the siRNA attachment locus. Our work establishes the feasibility of biomolecule delivery to plants with DNA nanostructures and both details the design parameters of importance for plant cell internalization and also assesses the impact of DNA nanostructure geometry for gene silencing mechanisms. This work will be of interest to the plant biology community and will help in the development of plant biotechnology."

We show that small tributaries can be a significant source of nutrients to large water bodies, especially in the form of dissolved inorganic nutrients. This is important because dissolved inorganic nutrients are more bioavailable to algae, which can lead to more frequent and intense algal blooms. Our findings suggest that small tributaries may be a significant source of coastal eutrophication, and that efforts to reduce nutrient loading in large water bodies should include small tributaries."

We find that the long-time dynamics of such systems are biased toward states that exhibit a fine-tuned extremization of environmental forcing. This behavior is reminiscent of the behavior of a mechanical system that is driven by a rare combination of forces. We discuss the implications of our results for the study of the origin of fine-tuning in nature.

Here, we present a study of an abrupt climate change event that occurred during a glacial period. We show that this event was accompanied by a global warming, anoxia of the deep ocean, and a doubling of atmospheric CO2. These changes were linked to the injection of organic matter into the ocean, which led to a global increase in the amount of C in the system. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms that led to the evolution of the Earth system and the origin of life. They also provide a framework for understanding the history of abrupt climate change in the past and the potential for such changes in the future."

We show that certification has a positive impact on the rate of deforestation, but that this impact is largely due to the certification of plantations that are already small and contain little residual forest. We also show that certification has no impact on the rate of active fire detection in oil palm plantations. Our results suggest that certification has not yet achieved its full potential to reduce deforestation, and that the scheme will need to be strengthened to achieve this goal."

In many species, sex is determined by a single locus, resulting in two sexes. In species with multiple sex determination loci, however, sex determination is polygenic. Here we show that polygenic sex determination can produce a modular response in secondary sexual characteristics, which can be used to understand the evolutionary causes and consequences of sex determination alleles in populations."

One of the most important metabolic changes in cancer is the up-regulation of the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). SHMT converts serine into glycine and a tetrahydrofolate-bound one-carbon unit. This one-carbon unit is used to synthesize purine and thymidine, which are essential for cell growth. We have developed a series of small-molecule inhibitors of SHMT, and show that these compounds block colon cancer tumor growth in mice. We also show that one-carbon metabolism is a targetable metabolic deficiency of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a cancer type that is particularly sensitive to SHMT inhibition. Thus, one-carbon metabolism is a metabolic vulnerability of cancer that can be exploited therapeutically. This work provides a foundation for the development of small-molecule cancer therapeutics that target one-carbon metabolism. (Read more)"

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show here that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants.
