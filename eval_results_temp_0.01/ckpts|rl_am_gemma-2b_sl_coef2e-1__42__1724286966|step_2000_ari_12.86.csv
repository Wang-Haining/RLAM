However, the structure of hydrate formed by noble gases is still unknown. Here, we report the structure of neon hydrate at high pressure and temperature. The structure is found to be ice II-structured, in which neon atoms are enclathrated in water molecules. This finding provides a new understanding of the structure of hydrate formed by noble gases. It also provides a new perspective for the study of the structure of hydrate formed by other elements. This work is expected to be of great significance for the study of the structure of hydrate in the future."

However, the origin of this transition has remained elusive. Here, we present the first comparative analysis of the genomes of two myxozoans and a cnidarian, and we show that the myxozoan body plan is remarkably reduced in terms of both gene content and genome size. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by a reduction in genome size and gene content. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the myxozoan transition was accompanied by a reduction in complexity, and that the resulting parasite is a simplified version of the ancestral cnidarian. This study provides a unique perspective on the origin of parasitic lifestyles. (Show more)"

The virus has evolved a strategy to evade the antiviral action of interferon (IFN), which is a key factor in the innate immune response. In this study, we show that the accessory protein ORF6 of SARS-CoV-2 is able to block nuclear import of IFN-stimulated factors (ISFs), which is a key step in the induction of IFN-stimulated genes. We found that ORF6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1, a protein complex involved in nuclear import. We also show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs the interaction between ORF6 and the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its ability to antagonize the antiviral action of IFN. Our findings provide a mechanism of viral antagonism that could be used by SARS-CoV-2 to escape the antiviral action of IFN. This mechanism could be used by other viruses as well. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of proton channels, but the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels is not completely understood. Here, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

We quantify the effect of global warming on maize yields in the major maize-producing and -exporting countries. We find that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields will increase to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields. As a result, the probability that the major maize-exporting countries have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming. Our results underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance. They also portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. They underscore the need for global cooperation to mitigate climate change."

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is largely unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa in the field. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammal species in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.

We show that the NWFP halted the decline of bird populations in early-seral ecosystems, but that the decline of older forests accelerated. This is partly due to the loss of older forests to fire on federal land and continued clearcutting elsewhere. The NWFP is a unique opportunity to evaluate the influence of policy. Our findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure.

Therefore, the development of new antibiotics is urgently needed. Here, we present a computational approach to identify new antibiotics. The approach is based on the prediction of the membrane permeability, binding affinity to the ribosome, and solubility of acylide antibiotics. We tested the best candidates in vitro and in vivo. The best candidate is synthetically more accessible, exhibits higher membrane permeability, and is up to 56 times more active against resistant pathogens than telithromycin. Notably, the best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. Thus, the approach presented here can be used to identify new antibiotics. This will help to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens and to prevent the development of antibiotic resistance. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

We observe dramatic shifts in effective moisture, resulting in large-scale changes in one of the world’s largest lakes and most diverse freshwater ecosystems. Results show evidence for 24 lake level drops of more than 200 m during the Late Quaternary, including 15 lowstands when water levels were more than 400 m lower than modern. A dramatic shift is observed at the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT), consistent with far-field climate forcing, which separates vastly different hydroclimate regimes before and after ∼800,000 years ago.

We show that the Osmium isotope ratios of magnetic grains and microspherules from the YD boundary sites are similar to average upper continental crust, indicating a terrestrial origin of Os in these samples. In contrast, the Os isotope ratios of bulk sediments from YD sites in Belgium and Pennsylvania suggest mixing with extraterrestrial Os, but the Os in these samples is likely terrestrially derived.

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal and transformed cells is more complex than previously appreciated. We have shown that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. Thus, TRAP1 may be a promising target for cancer therapy."

Actin filaments are also the sites of many cellular processes, including cell division. In order to control the dynamics of actin filaments, cells have evolved a family of proteins that can sever actin filaments. However, how these proteins sever actin filaments in a physiological context, where filaments are interconnected and under mechanical stress, remains unclear. Here, we show that the proteins of the ADF/cofilin family can sever actin filaments in a mechanical context. We also show that the severing rate is enhanced by a mechanical torque. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. Our work provides a mechanistic understanding of how ADF/cofilin can control the dynamics of actin filaments in cells.

The distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population.

We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden.

We find that the wispy, wheel-shaped orb web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to capture the sound-induced air particle movements that approach the maximum physical efficiency better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By sensing the motion of web threads, the spider remotely detects and localizes the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave, such as those emitted by approaching prey or predators. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,00"

We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions. Our findings are important for understanding the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV in humans and for developing strategies to prevent MERS-CoV transmission to humans. These"

In resource-scarce settings, where outbreaks are likely to emerge, laboratory diagnostics and bioinformatics capacity are limited. We used metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) to investigate the pathogen landscape of undifferentiated febrile illness in a periurban population in Cambodia. We identified a variety of vector-borne, zoonotic, and emerging pathogens responsible for undifferentiated fevers. We found that mNGS can be used to investigate undifferentiated febrile illness in resource-scarce settings. Coordinated and ongoing mNGS pathogen surveillance can better identify the breadth of endemic, zoonotic, or emerging pathogens and deployment of rapid public health response.

Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods.

The NVDRS summarizes violent death incidents with structured variables and unstructured narratives. We identify 225 latent topics in the narratives (e.g., preparation for death and physical aggression); many of these topics are not captured by existing structured variables.

Here, we show that the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP; IL1R3) is expressed on candidate leukemic stem cells in the majority of AML patients, but not on normal hematopoietic stem cells. We demonstrate that monoclonal antibodies targeting IL1RAP have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We also show that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects. These results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. Furthermore, we show that the IL1RAP-targeting antibody can be used to treat primary human AML cells. Thus, the IL1RAP-targeting antibody is a promising candidate for clinical application. This study provides a proof of principle for the use of antibodies as a treatment modality for AML. The results also provide a platform for the development of antibodies targeting other targets on candidate AML stem cells. This approach may lead to the development of more efficient and more effective therapies for AML. (Read more)"

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

Here, we identified and characterized a protein (MTX) that is highly concentrated in the submandibular salivary gland of the bat, Myotis pilosus. MTX inhibits the antiviral immune response of the host and facilitates viral infection by selectively inhibiting the epoxide hydrolase function of leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) to inhibit LTA4 hydrolysis and the generation of potent lipid chemoattractant for host defense against infection, LTB4. MTX has no effect on the aminopeptidase function of LTA4H and therefore does not impair the antiinflammatory function of LTA4H. This study provides deeper insight into immunologically privileged sites for microbial community residence in bats and supports the therapeutic potential of targeting MTX-LTA4H. The findings also provide a deeper understanding of the immunosuppressant protein MTX and its role in the immune system of bats. This study may also provide a new perspective for the study of the immune system of bats and the development of antiviral drugs. This article is"

One of the key metabolic pathways that supports cell growth is the one-carbon unit pathway, which is supported by the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). SHMT is up-regulated in cancer, and is a promising target for cancer therapy. Here we report the discovery of a series of small-molecule inhibitors of SHMT. We also report the discovery of a new mechanism of action for SHMT inhibitors, which is rooted in defective glycine import. This mechanism of action may be applicable to other diseases, and may be a useful strategy for the design of new drugs. Thus, this work provides a framework for the design of new drugs for cancer and other diseases."

These proteins form characteristic intracellular inclusion bodies that are present in all forms of the disease. Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions in ALS are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. Rather, the inclusion bodies in ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. This study provides a new perspective on the pathogenesis of ALS and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies. (PsycINFO Database Record"

The band structures of the 2D photonic crystals are predicted to produce unconventional atom–light interaction behaviors, including anisotropic emission, suppressed spontaneous decay, and photon-mediated atom–atom interactions controlled by the position of the atomic array relative to the photonic crystal. An optical conveyor technique is presented for continuously loading atoms into the desired trapping positions with optimal coupling to the photonic crystal. The device configuration also enables application of optical tweezers for controlled placement of atoms. Devices can be fabricated reliably from a 200-nm silicon nitride device layer using a lithography-based process, producing predicted optical properties in transmission and reflection measurements. These 2D photonic crystal devices can be readily deployed to experiments for many-body physics with neutral atoms and engineering of exotic quantum matter. We believe that this work will lead to a new generation of experiments in many-body physics with neutral atoms.

In this study, we found that STING is required for normal β-cell function. STING deficiency decreased expression of β-cell function–related genes, contributing to impaired GSIS. Mechanistically, the transcription factor Pax6 was down-regulated and its nuclear localization was lost in STING-βKO β-cells. Together, these data revealed a function of STING in the regulation of insulin secretion and established pathophysiological significance of fine-tuned STING within β-cells and insulin target tissues for maintaining glucose homeostasis. These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanism of STING in the pathogenesis of T2D. Moreover, they may lead to the development of STING-targeted therapies for T2D. This study also provides a new perspective for the development of STING-targeted therapies for other diseases. (Show more)"

The genome of the virus is segmented into eight RNA fragments, which is a unique feature of the virus. This genome organization offers evolutionary advantages, but it also complicates the packaging of the genome into virions. Here, we identified a direct interaction between two viral RNA segments of an influenza A virus. This interaction is required for optimal viral replication and favors the copackaging of the interacting RNA segments. Our results indicate that the interaction between viral RNA segments is sequence specific and sequence dependent. This interaction might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses. Our findings have implications for the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of viral packaging and might also lead to the development of new antiviral strategies.

The development of atherosclerotic lesions is a complex process that involves a series of events, including the induction of proatherosclerotic phenotypes in vascular endothelial cells (ECs). The objective of this study is to investigate the functional role of Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) in the disturbed flow-induced induction of proatherosclerotic phenotypes in ECs. Our results demonstrate that the activation of YAP/TAZ by disturbed flow is critical for the induction of proatherosclerotic phenotypes in ECs. In addition, inhibition of YAP/TAZ translation is sufficient to reduce the size of atherosclerotic lesions in vivo. Therefore, inhibition of YAP/TAZ activation is a promising athero-protective therapeutic strategy. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the functional role of YAP/TAZ in the disturbed flow-induced induction of proatherosclerotic phenotypes in ECs and atherosclerotic lesion development.

We connect changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods with economic and demographic data and find that three factors predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities. Our method can be used to monitor the physical changes in other cities and to study the physical dynamics of cities in general.

However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis is driven by altered nutrient cycling during heat stress. We demonstrate that the metabolic energy demand of the coral host increases during heat stress, which is compensated by the catabolism of amino acids. This shift from uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont subsequently promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host. This study provides a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

We find that treatment of breast cancer cells with chemotherapy enhances the expression of the type I tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor ROR1. ROR1 expression is also induced by activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or B lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region 1 homolog (BMI1). ROR1 expression is enriched in breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and correlates with the capacity of these tumors to metastasize. Finally, treatment of mice bearing breast cancer PDXs with the humanized anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab and paclitaxel was more effective than treatment with either alone in eradicating breast cancer PDXs. These results indicate that targeting ROR1 may improve the response to chemotherapy of patients with breast cancer. Thus, ROR1 may be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of breast cancer. (Read more)"

Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. Our findings have implications for our ability to predict the impacts of climate change on ecosystem functioning. They also highlight the importance of considering the combined effects of biodiversity loss and environmental warming in the design of conservation and restoration strategies. This is critical given that biodiversity loss and environmental warming are two of the most profound threats to the functioning of ecosystems."

Here, we used a portable two-photon microscope to record the activity of a large number of neurons in freely behaving mice. We found that grid cells, which encode the animal’s location, are anatomically segregated from border, head-direction, and object-vector cells, which encode the direction of travel and the location of objects in the environment. These data provide a detailed map of the topographic organization of MEC neurons that will be useful for understanding the encoding of spatial information in the brain."

We show that striatonigral fibers originating in the striatum form highly unusual bouquet-like arborizations that target bundles of ventrally extending dopamine-containing dendrites and clusters of their parent nigral cell bodies. These clustered cell bodies in turn project to the striatum as part of the classic nigrostriatal pathway. Thus, these striosome–dendron bouquets likely represent subsystems with the nigro–striato–nigral loop that are affected in human disorders including Parkinson’s disease. Given evidence that striosomes receive input from cortical regions related to the control of mood and motivation and that they link functionally to reinforcement and decision-making, the striosome–dendron bouquets could be critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease. This study provides a unique view of the dopamine-containing nigral system and its connections. It also provides a model for the study of other systems in the brain."
