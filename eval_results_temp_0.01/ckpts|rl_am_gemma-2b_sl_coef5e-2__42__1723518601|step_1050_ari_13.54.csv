The most promising approach to their solution is to develop a mathematical theory that is able to capture the essence of quantum mechanics. In this paper, we develop such a theory. It is based on the idea that quantum mechanics is a special case of a more general theory of “quantum spaces.” A quantum space is a category that is equipped with a set of “observables” and a set of “measurements.” We show that the category of Hilbert spaces is a quantum space. We also show that there are many other quantum spaces. In particular, there is a quantum space that is isomorphic to the category of quantum states. This shows that quantum mechanics is a special case of a more general theory."

The Myxozoa are thought to have evolved from a free-living cnidarian, but the evolutionary origin of this group has been elusive. We report the results of a comparative analysis of the genomes of two myxozoans and a cnidarian parasite, and show that the myxozoan and cnidarian genomes are strikingly similar, and that the myxozoan genome is one of the smallest reported in animals. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides a unique resource for understanding the origin and evolution of the Myxozoa. (Read more)"

In this study, we show that the SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein Orf6 is able to block the nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are essential for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes. We demonstrate that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and interacts with the Nup98-Rae1 complex, which is essential for the nuclear import of STAT1 and STAT2. We also show that a simple mutation in Orf6 abolishes its ability to block nuclear import and to antagonize IFN signaling. Our findings provide a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This mechanism may be relevant to other viruses that use the Nup98-Rae1 complex to evade the antiviral action of IFN. (Read more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1, but the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is largely unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa in the field. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammal species in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in body size and digestive physiology—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This work provides a blueprint for the use of DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet composition and overlap in other systems. (Less)"

This study provides a better understanding of the fate of the missing plastic debris in the ocean and will help to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean.

Here we show that trait anxiety directly influences social dominance in male outbred rats and identify an important mediating role for mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens. High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low-anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as decreased ATP and increased ROS production in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals. We conclude that mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens is crucial for social hierarchy establishment and is critically involved in the low social competitiveness associated with high anxiety.

This study may help to improve the safety of LCCBs in the treatment of hypertension. (PsycINFO Database Record"

The development of new antibacterial agents is a major challenge for the scientific community. In this work, we present a rational design approach to identify new acylide antibiotics. The design strategy is based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. We show that the best candidate is more active than telithromycin, a clinically used acylide antibiotic, and that it is up to 56 times more active against resistant pathogens than telithromycin. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. This work is a step forward in the development of new acylide antibiotics. The design strategy can be applied to other classes of antibiotics and to other targets.

Here, we introduce a network architecture that is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters, and that can be trained with a small number of images. The network architecture is based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales, and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters, and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice."

The temperature of the surface of the Earth is important for understanding the origin and evolution of life, and for the design of sustainable societies. The temperature of the Earth’s surface has been inferred from a variety of methods, including isotopic and paleontological evidence. However, the reliability of these methods has been questioned due to uncertainties regarding the accuracy of the isotopic and paleontological data, and the possibility of resetting of the isotopic record. Here, we present a method for determining the temperature of the Earth’s surface based on the thermostability of reconstructed ancestral enzymes. The results presented here provide a new method for determining the temperature of the Earth’s surface in the past and in the future."

Ion channels are classified into three major groups, K+, Na+, and Ca2+, and each group has its own unique channel family. The K+ channel family is the largest and most diverse, and it is further divided into three major groups, voltage-gated, ligand-gated, and calcium-activated. The calcium-activated K+ (BK) channel is the smallest and most specialized, and it is the only one that lacks a classic activation gate. We found that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. These findings provide a new perspective on the regulation of ion channels and may lead to the development of new drugs for treating diseases caused by ion channel dysfunctions. (Read"

In temperate regions, seasonal outbreaks correlate with decreases in ambient humidity. While low humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes them more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection and disease outcome in low humidity conditions. They also suggest that low humidity may be a modifiable risk factor for influenza virus infection. This may have implications for the development of strategies to reduce the impact of influenza virus disease in temperate regions. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

This merge operation is consistent with the idea that the brain first builds phrases and then merges them into larger structures. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases.

This work represents a key step toward the development of a synthetic plant-controlled symbiosis in which the bacteria fix N2 only when in contact with the desired host plant and are prevented from interaction with nontarget plant species.

Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. We find that the spider’s web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to capture the sound-induced air particle movements that approach the maximum physical efficiency better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By sensing the motion of web threads, the spider remotely detects and localizes the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave, such as those emitted by approaching prey or predators. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000"

Globally, fossil-fuel-related emissions account for about 65% of the excess mortality, and 70% of the climate cooling by anthropogenic aerosols. The chemical influence of air pollution on aeolian dust contributes to the aerosol cooling. Since aerosols mask the anthropogenic rise in global temperature, removing fossil-fuel-generated particles liberates 0.51(±0.03) °C and all pollution particles 0.73(±0.03) °C warming, reaching around 2 °C over North America and Northeast Asia. The steep temperature increase from removing aerosols can be moderated to about 0.36(±0.06) °C globally by the simultaneous reduction of tropospheric ozone and methane.

They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions. Our findings provide insights into the origin of MERS-CoV and the development of countermeasures against future coronavirus pandemics. This article is protected by copyright. All"

One of the most important proteins involved in the replication of the lagging strand is the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) sliding clamp. The PCNA-pol δ holoenzyme is responsible for replicating the lagging strand template and is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. We have developed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the holoenzyme. Our results indicate that the human holoenzyme is more stable than its S. cerevisiae counterpart and that the holoenzyme maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This work provides a unique perspective on the structure and function of the human lagging strand replication complex. It also provides a foundation for the development of new strategies for the treatment of cancer and other diseases caused by defects in lagging strand replication.

Here, we report the development of a ribozyme that can replicate RNA. This RNA polymerase ribozyme can amplify RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of PCR. The polymerase can also synthesize a variety of functional RNA molecules, including aptamers, ribozymes, and tRNA.

We demonstrate that iafgp alters the integrity of the peritrophic matrix and gut barrier, which are critical obstacles for Anaplasma colonization.

The presence of a fused scapulocoracoid in adult individuals independently evolved in Jinguofortisidae and Confuciusornithiformes may relate to an accelerated osteogenesis during chondrogenesis and likely formed through the heterochronic process of peramorphosis by which these basal taxa retain the scapulocoracoid of the nonavian theropod ancestors with the addition of flight-related modifications. The discovery of Jinguofortis increases the known ecomorphological diversity of basal pygostylians and highlights the importance of developmental plasticity for understanding mosaic evolution in early birds.

This glycan is catabolized by the bacteria, which in turn modulates the conditions in which the symbionts live, thereby enhancing their capacity to produce light. This glycan–bacteria–light relationship may be a common feature of the symbiosis between animals and their microbial partners. (Read more)"

In this study, we show that the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) is expressed on candidate leukemic stem cells in the majority of AML patients, but not on normal hematopoietic stem cells. We demonstrate that monoclonal antibodies targeting IL1RAP have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML and that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects. We also show that an antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling can suppress the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. (Read more)"

Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete."

We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting.

However, the mechanisms that facilitate virus spillover from bats to other animals and humans are not fully understood. Here, we identified and characterized a highly concentrated immunosuppressant protein (MTX) in the submandibular salivary gland of the bat, Myotis pilosus. MTX selectively inhibits the epoxide hydrolase function of leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) to inhibit LTA4 hydrolysis and the generation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a potent lipid chemoattractant for host defense against infection. MTX potently inhibits proinflammatory proteases to induce immune tolerance and maintain high stability. In mouse models, influenza A virus (IAV) infection and pathogenicity were exacerbated by MTX, but were reversed by interfering with the effects of MTX on LTA4H or exogenous LTB4 administration. This study provides deeper insight into immunologically privileged sites for microbial community residence in bats and supports the therapeutic potential of targeting MTX-LTA4H. This study also provides a potential mechanism for the emergence of influenza virus in humans. (PsycINFO Database"

We also identify small-molecule dual inhibitors of human SHMT1/2, and show that they are effective cellular target engagers. Finally, we show that formate can rescue cells from SHMT inhibition, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

These proteins form intracellular inclusion bodies that are characteristic of different neuropathological subtypes of the disease. Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions in the brain and spinal cord are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. Rather, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. This study provides a new perspective on the pathogenesis of ALS and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies. (PsycINFO Database Record"

To understand how sequential proteolysis contributes to MERS-CoV infection, we introduced mutations that blocked the first cleavages. These mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses trafficked past cell-surface proteases and into endosomes, whereas precleaved viruses used endosomal proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry. Uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence."

Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

However, the biosynthetic pathways of many of the volatile compounds in tomato fruit are not known. We have identified a gene essential for the production of all the detectable nitrogenous volatiles in tomato fruit. This gene encodes a flavin-dependent monooxygenase that catalyzes sequential hydroxylation reactions to produce the diverse set of nitrogenous volatiles. This work provides a major step forward in understanding the biosynthesis of tomato flavor. It also provides a model for the study of the biosynthesis of other classes of volatile compounds in plants. (Read more)"

This is because the diversity-functioning relationship becomes steeper, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This result is driven by two processes: (i) the greater chance of including species with thermal traits that enable them to maintain productivity as temperatures shift from ambient conditions, and (ii) an increase in the contribution of complementarity to the net biodiversity effect at high and low temperatures. Our results highlight the importance of considering the combined effects of global warming and biodiversity loss on ecosystem functioning.

We found that the speed at which people responded to each other was a robust predictor of how connected they felt. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.” This may be a fundamental mechanism of social connection."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We hypothesize that the paradox of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction is a result of the same factors that guided the design of sauropods, which were the largest animals that walked Earth."
