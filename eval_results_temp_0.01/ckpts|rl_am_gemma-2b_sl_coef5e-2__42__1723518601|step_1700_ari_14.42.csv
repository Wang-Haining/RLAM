Here, we report the results of a comparative analysis of the genomes and transcriptomes of two distantly related myxozoan species and a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Less)"

The virus responsible for this pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is able to evade the antiviral action of the immune system by blocking IFN signaling. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to block the nuclear import of IFN-stimulated genes by directly interacting with the Nup98-Rae1 complex, which is involved in the docking of the karyopherin/importin complex. Our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the antiviral action of the immune system and could be used to develop new antiviral strategies.

We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

Niche partitioning is one mechanism that can facilitate coexistence, but it is difficult to measure because it requires species to be identified at a taxonomic resolution that is not possible with traditional methods. We used DNA metabarcoding to identify species-level diet composition for seven large mammalian herbivores in a semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between species, even when they were similar in body size and digestive physiology. This suggests that trophic categorizations based on broad-scale trophic guilds may be misleading, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.

The strongest genetic risk factor influencing susceptibility to AD is the APOE genotype. APOE is a lipid-binding protein that is highly expressed in the brain and is involved in the clearance of senescent synapses. Here, we report a novel role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes, which is highly dependent on APOE isoform. We also found that APOE alleles affect the rate of accumulation of senescent synapses in the brain, which may contribute to the increased vulnerability of synapses to complement-mediated neurodegeneration in APOE4. These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes, and they suggest the hypothesis that AD susceptibility of APOE4 may originate in part from defective phagocytic capacity of astrocytes which accelerates the rate of accumulation of senescent synapses, enhancing synaptic vulnerability to complement-mediated neurodegeneration. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that APOE4 is associated with increased risk of stroke, which is also mediated by complement-dependent mechanisms."

The disease is caused by degeneration of motor neurons, which are the key cells for muscle contraction. The disease is caused by mutations in genes that encode motor neuron proteins, and also by expansion of a single nucleotide in a gene that encodes a protein found in the nucleus of motor neurons. We now report a method to convert adult human fibroblasts from living ALS patients to induced neuronal progenitor cells and subsequent differentiation into astrocytes. This method now enables rapid disease modeling and high-throughput drug screening to alleviate astrocyte-derived toxicity in ALS.

The pathogen induces the tick to express antifreeze glycoprotein, which alters the gut microbiota and the integrity of the peritrophic matrix, which is a critical obstacle for Anaplasma colonization. The pathogen also modifies the gut microbiota to facilitate the formation of biofilms, which are important for the survival of the pathogen in the gut of the vector.

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete. These findings provide insight into the regulation of carbon utilization in E. coli and the competition between translation and base pairing.

We demonstrate how this index can be used to monitor crop status and provide earlier and more precise predictions of crop yields than official USDA forecasts released midseason. Our results show that the Crop Condition Index can be used to monitor crop conditions and provide early warnings of crop failures, and can be used to improve the accuracy of yield forecasts. This work opens up the possibility of using the vast network of crop experts around the world to provide early warnings of crop failures and to improve the accuracy of yield forecasts."

Neuroinflammation is also regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) signaling, which is known to be involved in neuroinflammation. In this study, we found that neuroinflammation was reduced in both the early and later stages of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in microglia/macrophage-specific ASK1 knockout mice, whereas only the later-stage neuroinflammation was ameliorated in astrocyte-specific ASK1 knockout mice. These findings suggest that ASK1 is a promising therapeutic target for reducing neuroinflammation.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility in autism and suggests a potential target for the treatment of autism.

However, the role of FSIP1 in the progression and drug sensitivity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. This article is protected by copyright.

However, these two factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function.

In this study, we show that the intracellular levels of iron can influence the retina. We also show that the levels of iron can be manipulated to protect the retina from damage. These findings have implications for the treatment of retinal diseases. (Read more)"

However, the evolution of predators has been considered a dead end, due to the constraints associated with the evolution of morphological and functional optimizations throughout the organism. Here we show that the evolution of siphonophore predators has been driven by the evolution of specialized structures dedicated to prey capture. Our results contribute to understanding the evolution of predators, and the structure of food webs."

The evolution of the human hand is a key topic in the study of human evolution. This study provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key derived feature of the human hand, the third metacarpal styloid process, and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo. This finding has implications for the evolution of the human hand and for the origin of modern humans."

We report the discovery of a small-molecule dual inhibitor of human serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 and 2, and show that this compound blocks the growth of colon cancer xenografts in mice. We also show that the one-carbon donor formate is a potent rescue of SHMT inhibition in colon cancer cells, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We further show that glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. These results have implications for the treatment of cancer, and for the development of new therapeutics for lymphoma. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

This is a significant finding given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals.

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction."
