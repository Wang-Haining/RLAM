In addition, we show that myxozoan genomes are among the smallest reported in animals and that they are highly reduced in gene content. These results provide insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic cnidarian."

We found that the SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein Orf6 is responsible for this activity and that it does so by directly binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex at the nuclear pore complex. This interaction prevents the docking of the karyopherin/importin complex, which is responsible for the nuclear import of the transcription factors.

We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven LMH species (six wild, one domestic) in semiarid African savanna. Our results show that LMH are highly specialized in their consumption of grasses and nongrasses, and that species that are similar in body size and proportional grass consumption have the greatest overlap in their diets. These findings suggest that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.

This problem can be addressed by the development of new antibacterial agents to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. In this study, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. The design strategy presented here is a promising tool for the development of new antibiotics. (Show more)"

We observe dramatic shifts in effective moisture, resulting in large-scale changes in one of the world’s largest lakes and most diverse freshwater ecosystems. Results show evidence for 24 lake level drops of more than 200 m during the Late Quaternary, including 15 lowstands when water levels were more than 400 m lower than modern. A dramatic shift is observed at the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT), consistent with far-field climate forcing, which separates vastly different hydroclimate regimes before and after ∼800,000 years ago. Before 800 ka, lake levels were lower, indicating a climate drier than today, and water levels changed frequently. Following the MPT high-amplitude lake level variations dominate the record. From"

We show that the 187Os/188Os ratios of magnetic grains and bulk sediment from the YDB sites in Arizona, Michigan, New Mexico, New Jersey, and Ohio are similar to average upper continental crust, indicating a terrestrial origin of osmium in these samples. In contrast, the YDB site in Pennsylvania is remarkable in yielding 2- to 5-mm diameter spherules containing minerals such as suessite that form at temperatures in excess of 2000 °C. The 187Os/188Os ratios of the spherules and their leachates are often low, but Os in these objects is likely terrestrially derived. The rare earth element patterns and Sr and Nd isotopes of the spherules indicate that their source lies in 1.5-Ga Quebecia terrain in the Grenville Province of northeastern North America.

We used a comprehensive dataset of 89 genes to estimate the timing and rates of beetle diversification, and a dataset of 154 genomes or transcriptomes to trace the evolution of genes enabling symbiont-independent digestion of plant cell walls. Phylogenomic analyses of these uniquely comprehensive datasets resolved previously controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, plant cell wall-degrading enzymes obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, both major independent origins of specialized herbivory in beetles coincide with the first appearances of these genes in their genomes."

We used a grid-based approach to sample the genomic diversity across the island, and we found that the Malagasy population is a mixture of Bantu and Austronesian populations, with a limited contribution from Europe and the Middle East. The distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, we found that a few centuries are sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. This study provides a comprehensive view of the genetic history of Madagascar. It also provides a reference for the genetic diversity of the island and the Indian Ocean region. It will be useful for the study of human evolution and migration. It will also be useful for the conservation of the genetic diversity of the island. (Show more)"

K+ channels commonly possess two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. These findings provide insights into the mechanism of K+ channel gating and the regulation of K+ channel activity. They also provide a possible explanation for the BK channel’s unique properties, such as its normal closing and the absence of C-type inactivation. These findings may also provide a new approach for the development of drugs for"

One of the key steps in the parasite’s life cycle is invasion of the red blood cell (RBC), which is the site of parasite replication. Here, we show that the malaria parasite binds to the surface of the RBC, which leads to changes in the physical properties of the cell. These changes are critical for invasion, suggesting that the parasite is priming the cell surface to facilitate invasion. This is a major change in our understanding of the invasion process, suggesting that it is a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces working together to facilitate entry. This could lead to the development of new strategies to prevent invasion. (Show more)"

In temperate regions, seasonal influenza outbreaks correlate with decreases in ambient humidity. While low humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes them more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms of dry air-induced disease pathology and suggest that low humidity may be a potential target for influenza vaccine and antiviral development.

This pattern of activity is consistent with a merge operation that applies equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity. More superficial models of language, based solely on sequential transition probability over lexical and syntactic categories, only captured activity in the posterior middle temporal gyrus. Activity in superior temporal and inferior frontal cortices was consistent with a neural implementation of a bottom-up or left-corner parser.

This suggests that the Black Death was not introduced into Europe by a single event, but rather by multiple introductions."

There is an urgent need for novel and more efficient therapies for AML, ideally targeting the disease-initiating cells that are essential for maintaining the disease. We show here that monoclonal antibodies targeting the IL1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This study provides a proof of principle for the use of antibodies as a treatment for AML. This approach could be"

The distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population.

As an alternative approach, extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying the convergence of the targets and functions of the autism-risk genes to facilitate mapping out causal paths. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. Mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning.

To understand how MERS-CoV infects human cells, we engineered viruses with mutations that blocked sequential proteolytic events. These mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence. Our findings may help to develop more effective vaccines and therapeutics for MERS-CoV. (Show more)"

The cause of bleaching is the overheating of the coral host, which leads to the death of the zooxanthellae. However, the mechanisms that lead to the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis are still poorly understood. Here, we show that the breakdown of the symbiosis is driven by altered nutrient cycling, which is a direct consequence of the increased metabolic demand of the coral host. Our findings provide a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help us to predict the fate of coral reefs in a changing world."

This suggests that nutrient management efforts should focus on small watersheds to reduce the ecological impacts of nutrient loading on valuable nearshore ecosystems.

We show that certification is associated with a 33% reduction in deforestation from a counterfactual of 9.8 to 6.6% y−1. However, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results suggest that certification is not yet delivering on its promise."

We provide the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key derived feature of the human hand, the third metacarpal styloid process, in a fossil from East Africa. This fossil thus provides the earliest evidence for the evolution of a key shared derived characteristic of modern human and Neandertal hand morphology and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato.

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the discovery of a 150-million-year-old"
