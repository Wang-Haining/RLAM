These results suggest that the transition from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic myxozoan was accompanied by extreme degeneration of the genome and gene content. This study provides insight into the molecular basis of the evolution of the Myxozoa. (Show more)"

The disease is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is able to evade the antiviral action of the immune system by blocking the nuclear import of key transcription factors. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 uses a viral accessory protein, Orf6, to block nuclear import of transcription factors. We found that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 to disrupt nuclear import. Our data uncover a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. Our findings have important implications for the development of antiviral strategies against COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

We show that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields will increase to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. They also underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance. (Show more)"

Niche partitioning is one mechanism that can promote coexistence, but it is difficult to test empirically because of the high costs of species-level identification. We used DNA metabarcoding to identify plant species consumed by seven species of large mammals in semiarid African savanna. We found that the degree of diet overlap was strongly correlated with the proportion of grass consumption, suggesting that the proportion of grass consumption can be used to infer diet breadth. We also found that species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption had the greatest dietary overlap. These results suggest that the coexistence of species in LMH assemblages may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.

This resistance requires sustained activation of mTORC1 and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)C1-dependent induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. Furthermore, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a transcriptional target of SREBP1, mediates the ferroptosis-suppressing activity of SREBP1 by producing monounsaturated fatty acids. Genetic or pharmacologic ablation of SREBP1 or SCD1 sensitized ferroptosis in cancer cells with PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway mutation.

The best designed compounds are up to 56 times more active than telithromycin, the current standard of care. The design strategy can be used to develop new acylide antibiotics with improved properties. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

We observe dramatic shifts in effective moisture, resulting in large-scale changes in one of the world’s largest lakes and most diverse freshwater ecosystems. Results show evidence for 24 lake level drops of more than 200 m during the Late Quaternary, including 15 lowstands when water levels were more than 400 m lower than modern. A dramatic shift is observed at the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT), consistent with far-field climate forcing, which separates vastly different hydroclimate regimes before and after ∼800,000 years ago. Before 800 ka, lake levels were lower, indicating a climate drier than today, and water levels changed frequently. Following the MPT high-amplitude lake level variations dominate the record. From "

We show that our approach can identify CDR changes that alleviate the impact of two Omicron mutations on the epitope.

These social-learning conditions were compared with an asocial individual-learning condition in which individual participants made repeated attempts at constructing a paper plane, without having access to any planes produced by other participants. Larger populations generated greater variation in plane performance and gave participants access to better-adapted planes, but this did not enhance CCE. In fact, there was an inverse relationship between population size and CCE: plane flight distance did not improve over the experimental generations in the 2-Model and 4-Model conditions, but did improve over generations in the 1-Model social-learning condition.

We used a grid-based approach to sample the island at high resolution, revealing a Bantu and Austronesian ancestry for all Malagasy individuals. We also found a limited contribution from Europe and the Middle East, suggesting a recent arrival of the Malagasy people. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, we found that a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. These results provide insights into the history of Madagascar and the Indian Ocean region. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

This mechanism is used to promote long-term attachment to surfaces, which is critical for the pathogen to establish infections. The type IV pili are extended and retracted, and this activity is sensed by a chemosensory system that regulates the activity of the pili. This system is similar to the chemotaxis system used by many bacteria to sense gradients of chemical signals. Our results demonstrate that the type IV pili are mechanosensitive and can be used as a sensor to regulate surface-induced gene expression and pathogenicity.

However, the predominant Np4 decapping enzyme in bacteria, ApaH, is inactivated by the very conditions of disulfide stress that enable Np4 accumulation. Here, we show that, in the presence of disulfide stress, the pyrophosphohydrolase RppH assumes a leading role in decapping Np4-capped RNAs. This enzyme recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5′ termini, resulting in a one-nucleotide shift in substrate specificity. The unconventional manner in which RppH recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress.

The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel is the major potassium channel in the heart. It is normally open and in a closed state during the heart’s repolarization phase. We found that the BK channel’s closed state is state-dependent and that its closing is closed state-dependent. We also found that the BK channel’s closing is slow and that its closing rate is inversely correlated with channel-open probability. These findings provide insights into the BK channel’s normal function and may be useful for the development of BK channel modulators. (Read more)"

The parasite uses a variety of mechanisms to invade the red blood cell (RBC), the host cell in which it replicates. Here, we show that the malaria parasite uses a single protein, EBA175, to bind to the surface of the RBC and alter its biophysical properties. We show that this interaction leads to an increase in the cytoskeletal tension of the RBC and a reduction in its bending modulus. These changes in the RBC are correlated with the ability of the parasite to invade the RBC. This study suggests that the malaria parasite uses a single protein to alter the biophysical properties of the RBC, reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion. This would constitute a major change in our understanding of the invasion process. (Show more)"

We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden.

Here, we show that the ears of the orb-weaving spider are not constrained by the organism’s body but are extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. We find that the spider’s web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to sense the motion of web threads, which is used to remotely detect and localize the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave. The spider enables the outsourcing and supersizing of auditory function, which provides unique features for studying extended and regenerative sensing and designing novel acoustic flow detectors for precise fluid dynamic measurement and manipulation.

We use this method to study the factors that predict neighborhood improvement in five US cities. We find that neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements. Neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities. Our method can be used to study the physical dynamics of other urban systems, such as the dynamics of urban poverty. We hope that our method will be useful to researchers and practitioners in the fields of urban studies, urban informatics, and computer vision."

The source of the parchment, often called “uterine vellum,” has been a long-standing controversy in codicology. The Latin term abortivum in many sources has led some scholars to suggest that fetal calves or sheep skins were used. Others have argued that it would not be possible to sustain herds if so many pocket Bibles were made from fetal skins. Here, we report a simple and objective method to identify the animal origin of parchment. The noninvasive method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals. These results suggest that ultrafine vellum does not necessarily derive from the use of abortive or newborn animals with ultrathin hides, but could equally well reflect a production process that allowed the skins of maturing animals of several species to be rendered into vellum of equal quality and fineness. © 2018, The Author(s).

The age of the extinction is 251.941 ± 0.037 and 251.880 ± 0.031 Mya, an interval of 60 ± 48 ka.

We also provide a detailed quantitative picture of reporting about lethal violence and its gendered nature. Our method offers a flexible and broadly applicable approach to model topics in text data.

These results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. The IL1RAP-targeting antibody described here has the potential to be used in combination with other therapies, such as chemotherapy, to improve the survival rate of AML patients.

Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

Our analysis reveals no significant differences in the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration between control and warmed plots in all biomes, with the exception of deserts and boreal forests.

Moreover, across all nondesert biomes, respiration rates with and without experimental warming follow a Gaussian response, increasing with soil temperature up to a threshold of ∼25 °C, above which respiration rates decrease with further increases in temperature. This consistent decrease in temperature sensitivity at higher temperatures demonstrates that rising global temperatures may result in regionally variable responses in soil respiration, with colder climates being considerably more responsive to increased ambient temperatures compared with warmer regions.

Our findings suggest that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner. This process is likely to have shaped the evolution of the plastid genome and its genes, and may be relevant to other transitions in the evolution of life. This article is protected by copyright.

Therefore, it is difficult to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. Our study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility in autism and suggests that forgetting is a common mechanism for autism-risk genes. This study also provides a powerful tool for studying the function of autism-risk genes in the fruit fly.

MTX is a potent immunosuppressant that selectively inhibits the epoxide hydrolase function of leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) to inhibit LTA4 hydrolysis and the generation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a potent lipid chemoattractant for host defense against infection. MTX potently inhibited proinflammatory proteases to induce immune tolerance and maintain high stability.

We also show that one of the compounds is uniquely effective in a panel of B-cell cancers, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Thus, we have identified a targetable metabolic deficiency in B-cell cancers. This work provides a foundation for the development of small-molecule inhibitors of SHMT that could be used to treat cancer. This work also provides a foundation for the development of small-molecule inhibitors of SHMT that could be used to treat cancer."

The disease is caused by mutations in multiple genes, and the pathology of the disease is characterized by the formation of intracellular inclusions. These inclusions contain a variety of proteins that are not normally found in the same cellular compartment. We show that the proteins that are found in these inclusions are supersaturated in motor neurons, but not in other human tissues. Thus, the proteins that are found in inclusions are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. These results suggest that the formation of inclusions in ALS is a consequence of the metastable nature of the proteins that are found in these inclusions. This metastable nature of the inclusions may be a common feature of other neurodegenerative diseases. (Read more)"

The band structures of the 2D photonic crystals are predicted to produce unconventional atom–light interaction behaviors, including anisotropic emission, suppressed spontaneous decay, and photon-mediated atom–atom interactions controlled by the position of the atomic array relative to the photonic crystal. The device configuration also enables application of optical tweezers for controlled placement of atoms. Devices can be fabricated reliably from a 200-nm silicon nitride device layer using a lithography-based process, producing predicted optical properties in transmission and reflection measurements. These 2D photonic crystal devices can be readily deployed to experiments for many-body physics with neutral atoms and engineering of exotic quantum matter.

Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages.

However, the economic and ecological costs of wildfire have risen substantially in recent decades. Climate change has likely contributed to the increase in wildfire activity, but the direct role of people in increasing wildfire activity has been largely overlooked. We show that humans have vastly expanded the spatial and seasonal “fire niche” in the United States, accounting for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. Human-caused wildfires disproportionally occurred where fuel moisture was higher than lightning-caused fires, thereby helping expand the geographic and seasonal niche of wildfire. Actions to raise awareness and increase management in regions prone to human-started wildfires should be a focus of United States policy to reduce fire risk and associated hazards."

This shift from uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host.

It is composed of specialized cardiomyocytes, the sinoatrial (SAN) cells (SANCs). SAN cells are responsible for the generation of the heartbeat. SAN cells are able to adjust heart rate to meet hemodynamic demand by integrating the membrane and store-operated Ca2+ clocks. Here, we report that stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is a multifunctional regulator of Ca2+ dynamics in SANCs that links SR Ca2+ store content with electrical events occurring in the plasma membrane, thereby contributing to automaticity of the SAN. Our study reveals a previously unknown role of STIM1 in the regulation of Ca2+ dynamics in SANCs. This study also provides insights into the mechanism of SAN dysfunction in heart failure.

These results provide insights into the mechanism by which Si can enhance plant resistance against insect herbivores. (Show more)"

However, the impact of certification on deforestation has not been evaluated in a systematic way. We show that certification is associated with reduced deforestation in Indonesia. Nevertheless, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results suggest that certification is not yet achieving its potential to reduce deforestation."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We hypothesize that the increase in subsoil compaction risk has been a major driver of the evolution of sauropods, the largest terrestrial animals that ever walked the Earth. Our findings have important implications for the design of farm machinery and the evolution of sauropods.
