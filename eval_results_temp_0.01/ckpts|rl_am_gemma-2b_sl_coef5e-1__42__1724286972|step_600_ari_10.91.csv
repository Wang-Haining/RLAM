Here, we present a comparative analysis of the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species and a cnidarian species. Our results suggest that the Myxozoa are a sister group to the cnidarian parasite Polypodium hydriforme and that the myxozoan body plan was derived from a cnidarian.

We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer.

One hypothesis is that species partition food resources. However, the extent to which species do so is unknown because it is difficult to identify species-level differences in diet. We used DNA metabarcoding to identify plant species consumed by seven species of large herbivores in a semiarid African savanna. We found that species differed in the proportion of their diet made up of grasses, and that this proportion was correlated with isotopic estimates of the proportion of grass in their diet. We also found that species differed in the proportion of their diet made up of grasses, and that this proportion was correlated with isotopic estimates of the proportion of grass in their diet. Nonetheless, species did not overlap in their diets. These results suggest that species may partition food resources, but only to a limited extent.

However, the global load of plastic on the open ocean surface was estimated to be on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This discrepancy is explained by the selective removal of plastic debris by the ocean interior. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered.

The structures exhibit organic shapes and motions with irregular distributions of material phases. Within the structures, different materials play distinct roles yet seamlessly collaborate through sophisticated deformation mechanisms to produce the target behaviors.

The development of cancer is associated with the accumulation of mutations in the genome and in signaling pathways. In this study, we found that cancer cells with mutations in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway are resistant to ferroptosis, a form of regulated necrosis driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. This resistance is associated with activation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway and induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. We also found that SREBP1 mediates ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells through induction of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a transcriptional target of SREBP1 that produces monounsaturated fatty acids. These findings suggest that mTORC1 inhibition may sensitize cancer cells to ferroptosis induction, and that combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction may be a promising strategy for cancer therapy. This strategy may be applicable to a wide range of cancers with PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway mutations. (Read more)"

Our results show evidence for 24 lake level drops of more than 200 m during the Late Quaternary, including 15 lowstands when water levels were more than 400 m lower than modern. A dramatic shift is observed at the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT), consistent with far-field climate forcing, which separates vastly different hydroclimate regimes before and after the MPT. Our results suggest that the evolution of the African Great Lakes is a response to orbital forcing and that the MPT is a critical time in the evolution of the continent. The extreme hydroclimate variability exerted a profound influence on the Lake Malawi endemic cichlid fish species flock; the geographically extensive habitat reconfiguration provided novel ecological opportunities, enabling new populations to differentiate rapidly to distinct species"

Here, we report a novel role for APOE in controlling the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes. We also found that APOE alleles affect the accumulation of senescent synapses in the brain.

This mechanism reduces the required undercooling of iron nucleation, which provides a key factor in solving the paradox.

Here, we show that the malaria parasite alters the biophysical properties of the red blood cell to facilitate entry. This is a major change in our understanding of malaria parasite invasion. Our findings suggest that the malaria parasite primes the erythrocyte surface through its binding antigens, altering the biophysical nature of the target cell and thus reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion. This would constitute a major change in our concept of malaria parasite invasion, suggesting it is, in fact, a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces working together to facilitate entry.

Here, we show that housing mice in low humidity makes them more susceptible to severe disease following influenza virus infection. We also show that low humidity impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice.

However, the auditory organs of animals are extremely diverse in anatomy after hundreds of millions of years of evolution. Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. The spider’s web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to sense the motion of web threads and remotely detect and localize the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave. The spider’s web is also flexible and regularly regenerated, allowing it to be adjusted and regularly renewed. The outsourcing and supersizing of auditory function in spiders provides unique features for studying extended and regenerative sensing and designing novel acoustic flow detectors for precise fluid dynamic measurement and manipulation.

Xanthocillin is a siderophore that binds copper and has antimicrobial properties. The xanthocillin biosynthetic gene cluster is widespread in filamentous fungi, suggesting a role for this pathway in copper homeostasis and interactions with competing microbes. This study provides insight into the role of fungal natural products in copper homeostasis and the evolution of copper-binding siderophores in eukaryotes. This article is protected by copyright.

The detection of tridymite in a sedimentary rock at Gale crater is significant. Tridymite is a high-temperature (&gt;870 °C) SiO2 polymorph that is commonly associated with silicic volcanism. The presence of tridymite in a sedimentary rock at Gale crater is possibly due to the cogenetic detrital source from silicic volcanism in the vicinity of the crater. The diagenesis of the tridymite and associated silica-rich amorphous material is also consistent with the presence of aqueous fluids at the sediment source. The presence of tridymite in a sedimentary rock at Gale crater is significant in terms of the potential for the formation of silica polymorphs in sedimentary rocks on other planets.

These results indicate that Th17 cells can have two distinct functions in the pathogenesis of colitis. One is to directly induce a Th17 phenotype, and the other is to provide “help” for the development of classic Th1 cells. This dual function of Th17 cells may be important for the development of inflammatory bowel disease. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc."

Here, we present a high-resolution genomic analysis of the Malagasy population. We find that Madagascar is a unique place in the world, with a recent and sex-biased colonization from Africa and Asia. In addition, we show that a few centuries are sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. Our results provide a new perspective on the settlement history of Madagascar.

These RNAs are generally considered to be “noncoding,” but a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The RNA encodes a 28-amino acid protein that increases the activity of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. We also show that the RNA base pairs with the cadA and galE genes and that the base pairing interferes with the RNA’s ability to repress cadA and galE. These results demonstrate that the translation and base-pairing functions compete. This is an example of a dual-function RNA that has evolved to regulate metabolism. (Read more)"

We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a human antibody that is effective against SARS-CoV-2 Alpha, Beta, and Gamma but not Delta. Our optimized antibody can potentially be developed into antibody drug candidates for current and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our approach can be applied to other protein molecules.

It is also a highly plastic system that is modified by experience. Here we propose a model of language processing that is based on the idea that memory is supported by adaptive changes in neuronal excitability. This mechanism is sensitive to context and serial order and can be used to integrate information over time. Our results suggest that memory is maintained in a dynamic state that is accessed directly without cued retrieval. This mechanism is not reliant on synaptic plasticity or persistent activity. It is therefore a candidate substrate for the neural processing of language.

To infect human cells, MERS-CoV must first bind to cell receptors. To determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to MERS-CoV infection, we introduced mutations that blocked the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence.

Despite advances in treatment, the majority of patients relapse. In this study, we found that the expression of the orphan receptor tyrosine kinaselike orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) is increased in breast cancer cells following treatment with chemotherapy. We also found that ROR1 expression is associated with breast cancer stemness. Finally, we demonstrated that targeting ROR1 with the humanized monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab can improve the response to chemotherapy in a mouse model of breast cancer. These results suggest that targeting ROR1 may improve the response to chemotherapy in breast cancer. This approach may be particularly useful in patients who have developed resistance to chemotherapy. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc."

This suggests that the initiation of recombination in eukaryotes may be conserved and ancient. Our results also reveal a surprising polarity in recombination in the monkeyflower Mimulus guttatus. In this species, recombination is more likely to occur near the start of genes than in their middle or end. This polarity may be a consequence of the evolutionary history of the genus Mimulus.

The role of fibrous sheath interacting protein 1 (FSIP1) in TNBC has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 is highly expressed in TNBC and is associated with poor prognosis. FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. This article is protected by copyright.

Our results suggest that memory is not stored as a persistent depolarization but rather as a dynamic state that can be accessed directly. This mechanism is not reliant on synaptic plasticity or feedback. It is therefore a candidate substrate for the neural processing of language.

In the United States, the majority of nutrient pollution originates from small tributaries draining surrounding watersheds. However, the importance of small tributaries has been largely overlooked. We show that small tributaries can be a significant source of nutrients to coastal areas. Our findings have important implications for the design of nutrient management strategies to protect aquatic ecosystems."

Here, we study the dynamics of a simple chemical network in a thermodynamic environment that is biased toward rare combinations of chemical concentrations. We find that the long-time dynamics of such systems are biased toward states that exhibit a fine-tuned extremization of environmental forcing. Our results suggest that the extremization of external forcing may be a general principle underlying the dynamics of complex chemical systems. This article is protected by copyright.

Here we show that NMDAR-Ab encephalitis is associated with changes in the spectral composition of spontaneous EEG activity. We then show that these changes can be explained by a dynamic model of the cortical microcircuit. Finally, we show that these changes are sufficient to induce paroxysmal EEG abnormalities in a mouse model of the disease. These findings offer mechanistic insights into circuit-level dysfunction induced by NMDAR-Ab. They also suggest that the same circuit changes may be responsible for the paroxysmal EEG abnormalities in other autoimmune encephalitis. This article is protected by copyright.

This is mainly due to the lack of proxy records that can capture such events. Here, we present a multiproxy approach to reconstruct a global warming event that occurred ∼304 Ma. We show that the event was associated with a decrease in biodiversity and a doubling of atmospheric CO2. The event was likely triggered by a large organic matter burial event. Earth system modeling indicates that the event was associated with enhanced nutrient fluxes and thermocline stratification. This study highlights the importance of organic matter burial in triggering abrupt climate change. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Certification is the most common tool used to meet corporate and government commitments to reduce this deforestation. However, the impact of certification on deforestation has not been well studied. Here, we show that certification is associated with reduced deforestation in Indonesia. Nevertheless, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Our results suggest that certification is not yet having the intended conservation benefits. We recommend that certification be expanded to forested regions, that strict requirements be imposed to avoid all peat, and that certification be linked to routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss. These changes are necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Inc."

Its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases. However, the study of its regulation is limited by the lethality or the severity of phenotypes in human cells. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 (exocyst component of 70 kDa) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. This article is protected by copyright.

In many vertebrates, sex is determined by a single locus. In others, multiple loci interact to produce more than two genotypic sexes. Here we investigate the effects of multiple interacting sex determination alleles on secondary sexual characteristics in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii. We find that multiple alleles can produce a modular interplay of sex linkage and sex limitation, resulting in a variety of secondary sexual characteristics. These results suggest that multiple alleles can produce a higher-order polymorphism in secondary sexual characteristics. Our findings have implications for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations.

The retina is also a site of iron accumulation, which can lead to the formation of reactive oxygen species-generating adducts of vitamin A. We show that iron levels in the retina can influence the formation of these adducts and their photochemical degradation. These findings have implications for the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in the elderly. They also suggest that iron chelation may be beneficial in the treatment of age-related macular degeneration. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

However, the evolution of specialization is often considered a dead end. We show that siphonophores, a group of pelagic cnidarians, are an exception to this rule. They are characterized by a high degree of specialization, and have evolved to capture different prey types. Our results suggest that specialization is linked to the evolution of morphological changes in the tentacles, and that shifts between prey types are linked to shifts in the morphology, mode of evolution, and evolutionary correlations of the tentacles and their nematocysts. Our findings contribute to understanding how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs."

However, the evolution of the modern human hand is poorly understood because of a gap in the fossil record between 800,000 and 1.8 My. This study provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key derived characteristic of the human hand. The fossil also suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo. These findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution of the human hand and its role in tool use. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Cancer cells have a high demand for one-carbon units, which are essential for cell growth. The enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) converts serine into glycine and a tetrahydrofolate-bound one-carbon unit. Here we report the discovery of small-molecule dual inhibitors of human SHMT1/2. We show that these compounds are effective in cancer cell lines, and that one-carbon donor formate is a rescue agent. However, formate is a poor inhibitor of cancer cells with defective glycine import. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of cancer.

The use of farm machinery has greatly increased the productivity of agriculture, but it has also increased the weight of vehicles, which has led to subsoil compaction. We show that subsoil compaction is widespread and has increased over time. We also show that the weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth. This suggests that prehistoric animals may have caused subsoil compaction, which may have had a negative impact on the productivity of the ecosystem. Our results suggest that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This article is protected by copyright.
