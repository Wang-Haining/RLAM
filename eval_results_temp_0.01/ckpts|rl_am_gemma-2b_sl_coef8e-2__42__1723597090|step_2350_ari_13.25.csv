In this paper, we provide a purely categorical characterization of the category of Hilbert space operators, which is the mathematical foundation of quantum mechanics. Our characterization is based on a set of axioms that are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. This addresses a question about the foundations of quantum theory raised in reconstruction programs such as those of von Neumann, Mackey, Jauch, Piron, Abramsky, and Coecke.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus is able to evade the antiviral action of the immune system by blocking the nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are essential for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results show that the viral accessory protein Orf6 is responsible for this anti-IFN activity. We found that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain. This interaction disrupts the docking of the cargo-receptor complex and disrupts nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its anti-IFN function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This mechanism may be exploited by other viruses as well. This work provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. Sperm cells are quiescent in the male reproductive system due to Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1 channels, but become active once introduced into the low-Zn2+-concentration environment of the female reproductive tract. How Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. Here, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

However, the magnitude of the problem is still unclear. We show that the plastic debris is mostly concentrated in the convergence zones of the five subtropical gyres, but the total load is far less than expected. This is due to the selective removal of the plastic debris by the food webs and the ocean interior. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

The development of new antibiotics is a major challenge. We present a rational design approach to identify new antibiotics. The approach is based on the prediction of the solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity of acylide antibiotics. We show that the predicted best candidate is more active than telithromycin, the only approved acylide antibiotic, and that it is more accessible, exhibits higher solubility, and is up to 56 times more active against resistant pathogens than telithromycin. Notably, the best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. The approach presented here can be used to identify new antibiotics for the treatment of antibiotic-resistant infections. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The presence of two copies of the E4 allele increases risk by ∼12-fold whereas E2 allele is associated with an ∼twofold decreased risk for AD. These data put APOE central to AD pathophysiology, but it is not yet clear how APOE alleles modify AD risk. Here, we report a novel role for APOE in controlling the phagocytic capacity of astrocytes that is highly dependent on APOE isoform. These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes. They also suggest the hypothesis that AD susceptibility of APOE4 may originate in part from defective phagocytic capacity of astrocytes which accelerates the rate of accumulation of senescent synapses with enhanced vulnerability to complement-mediated neurodegeneration.

TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes.

We demonstrate that neurons are the source of a variety of potent inflammatory factors, which correlate with the extent of microgliosis. Moreover, we identify a unique neuron-specific inflammatory profile, which is absent in neighboring glial cells. Thus, we propose that the Aβ-burdened neuron is a primary proinflammatory agent, implicating the intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ as a significant immunological component in the AD pathogenesis.

The instrument was deployed in Beijing, China, to conduct observations. The observations show that the aerosol loading has no discernible effect on the liquid water path but increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius. This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation.

They open and close their pore gates to allow or block ion flow. K+ channels commonly possess two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that BK channel C-type inactivation is state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. Our findings may help us understand the mechanism of BK channel function and may provide a new target for drug development. (Show more)"

The parasite, Plasmodium, uses a variety of mechanisms to invade the human red blood cell (RBC), the target of the disease. Here, we show that the malaria parasite uses a specific antigen on the parasite surface to bind to the surface of the RBC, which alters the biophysical properties of the RBC. This change in the RBC properties allows the parasite to invade the cell more easily. This is a major change in our understanding of the invasion process and suggests that the parasite and host cell are working together to facilitate invasion. This could have implications for the development of new antimalarial strategies. (Show more)"

In the temperate regions, seasonal outbreaks of influenza correlate closely with decreases in ambient humidity. While low humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of interferon-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the impact of low humidity on influenza virus infection and disease outcome. They also suggest that low humidity may be a modifiable risk factor for influenza infection. These insights may lead to the development of strategies"

Our method can be used to monitor the physical appearance of neighborhoods over time and to identify neighborhoods that are likely to experience improvements. This information can be used to inform urban planning and to improve the quality of life in cities."

We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells.

The colonization happened recently, within the last few centuries, and the genetic structure is already detectable."

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The RNA encodes a protein that interacts with glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and increases dehydrogenase activity. We also show that the RNA base pairs with two genes and interferes with their regulation. These observations demonstrate that the protein and RNA compete for the same binding sites and that the protein can interfere with the action of the RNA. This is an example of a protein that has evolved to have a dual function. The protein may have evolved to have a regulatory function, but the regulatory function may have been lost and the protein now has a different function. This is an example of convergent evolution."

However, their assessments are subjective and categorical, and thus difficult to use in quantitative analyses. We show that the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Crop Progress and Condition (CPC) survey, which collects expert assessments of crop status on a weekly basis, can be transformed into a continuous, probabilistic variable that is better suited to quantitative analysis. We show that the CPC reflects the subjective perception of many surveyors at different locations, but that the underlying models that describe the reported crop status are statistically robust and maintain similar characteristics across different crops, exhibit long-term stability, and have nation-wide validity. We discuss the origin and interpretation of existing spatial and temporal biases in the survey data. Finally, we propose a quantitative Crop Condition Index based on the CPC survey and demonstrate how this index can be used to monitor crop status and provide earlier and more precise predictions of crop yields than official USDA forecasts released midseason.

ASK1 signaling in microglia played a major role in generating and maintaining disease. Activated astrocytes produce key inflammatory mediators, including CCL2, that further activated and recruited microglia/macrophages, in an astrocytic ASK1-dependent manner. Our findings demonstrate cell-type–specific roles of ASK1 and suggest phase-specific ASK1-dependent glial cell interactions in EAE pathophysiology.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of the core autistic symptoms and may facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies for autism. This article is protected by copyright.

We found that the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion. For the N3-EtdT lesion that disrupts base pairing, multiple transcriptional lesion bypass routes were found. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop).

Chemotherapy is the most common treatment for breast cancer, but the response to chemotherapy is heterogeneous. We found that the expression of the ROR1 receptor is increased in breast cancer cells following treatment with chemotherapy. This increase in ROR1 expression is associated with the activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or BMI1, which are important in the regulation of stemness. We also found that the humanized anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab repressed expression of genes associated with breast cancer stemness, reduced activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or BMI1, and impaired the capacity of breast cancer cells to metastasize or reengraft mice. Finally, treatment of mice bearing breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) with cirmtuzumab and paclitaxel was more effective than treatment with either alone in eradicating breast cancer PDXs. These results indicate that targeting ROR1 may improve the response to chemotherapy of patients with breast cancer. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation.

Certification is the most common tool used to meet corporate commitments to reduce this impact. However, the impact of certification on deforestation has not been evaluated in a way that allows for a clear assessment of its effectiveness. We show that certification is associated with reduced deforestation in oil palm plantations, but that the benefits are limited to areas that were already deforested before certification. Certification is also associated with reduced fire, but this effect is not mediated by deforestation. These findings suggest that certification is not yet having the impact needed to meet corporate commitments to reduce deforestation."

Here we investigate the effects of sex determination on secondary sexual characteristics in a model system, the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii. We find that the genetic basis of sex determination in this species produces a modular interplay of sex linkage and sex limitation, resulting in a variety of sex-linked traits. In addition, the acquisition of a new sex determiner in a newly colonized population produces a variety of traits that are not linked to sex. These results suggest that the genetic basis of sex determination in M. mbenjii is capable of producing a variety of sexual phenotypes, and that the maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles can have a major impact on the morphology and behavior of populations. This modularity of secondary sexual characteristics may be a general feature of sex determination."

We sought to understand the role of iron in the retina and found that iron levels in the retina are elevated in a vitamin A-depleted albino mouse model. This finding was supported by the observation that iron chelation reduced the oxidative degradation of the photoreceptor cell lipofuscin intermediates. These findings have implications for the retina, as well as for other tissues challenged by reactive oxygen species and photodegrading intermediates. This article is protected by copyright.

However, the evolution of specialization is often considered a dead end, as it is difficult to evolve morphological and functional optimizations in separate structures. Here we show that siphonophores, a group of pelagic cnidarians, have evolved modularity in their feeding structures, and that these structures have strong evolutionary associations with prey type. Our findings contribute to understanding the evolution of specialization, and the role of morphological innovation in the diversification of food webs."

These features are thought to have evolved over hundreds of thousands of years, but the timing and evolutionary context of their origin is unclear. Here we show that the third metacarpal styloid process, a key feature of the human hand, was present in a Middle Pleistocene hominin fossil from Kenya. This provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of this key derived hand feature and suggests that it arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo. This finding has implications for our understanding of the evolution of the human hand and the origins of modern human form. (Less)"

One-carbon units are essential for cell growth, and are generated by the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). Here we show that dual knockout of SHMT1 and SHMT2 blocks tumor growth in a colon cancer xenograft model. We also identify a small-molecule inhibitor of SHMT1/2, and show that it is effective in cellular models. Finally, we show that formate, a one-carbon donor, is a potent inhibitor of SHMT1/2, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of DLBCL. These studies provide a foundation for the development of SHMT inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy for cancer.

However, little is known about the impact of deforestation on people’s diets. We show that deforestation can have a negative impact on people’s diets, and that this impact is exacerbated by fragmentation of forests. Our findings have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals."

We show that the weight of modern farm machinery has increased by a factor of 10, and that the weight of the largest farm vehicles is now approaching that of the sauropods, the largest animals that walked the Earth. We hypothesize that the roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the largest sauropods, the brachiosaurs, had a fixed foraging trail that they followed for their entire life. This study highlights the need for a more stringent design of farm machinery to reduce the risk of subsoil compaction. The implications of this study are that the use of farm machinery may have had a significant impact on the evolution of the largest animals that walked the Earth. This hypothesis needs to be tested in the future."
