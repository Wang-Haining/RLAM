In this work, we report the discovery of a hydrate structure of ice II, in which neon atoms are enclathrated in water molecules to form ice II-structured hydrates. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The resolved structure where Ne dissolved in ice II is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. The density distributions indicate that the vibration of Ne atoms is mainly in planes perpendicular to D2O channels, whereas their distributions along the channels are further constrained by interactions between adjacent Ne atoms. Our work provides a new perspective on the structure of ice II and its hydrate. It also provides a new route to study the structure of ice II by using a guest molecule as a probe. This work may also have implications for the structure of ice in the outer solar system. (Show more)"

Although the evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we present the first comparative genomic analysis of two distantly related myxozoan species, Kudoa iwatai and Myxobolus cerebralis, and compare these to the transcriptome and genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insight into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Show more)"

We found that SARS-CoV-2 uses a viral accessory protein, Orf6, to block nuclear import of the cargo-receptor complex. We also show that a single amino acid substitution in Orf6 abolishes its ability to block nuclear import and impair IFN antagonism. Our findings provide a mechanistic understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 evades the antiviral action of IFN and may provide a target for the development of antiviral strategies.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1, but the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. Here, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1.

We use global datasets of maize production and climate variability combined with future temperature projections to quantify how yield variability will change in the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. We find that as the global mean temperature increases, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields increases almost everywhere to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields. For the top four maize-exporting countries, which account for 87% of global maize exports, the probability that they have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because species-level identification of plant material is prohibitively difficult with traditional methods. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammal species in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammal assemblages, and that diversity of large mammals may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This may have important implications for the management of African savanna. (Show more)"

However, the mechanisms underlying social anxiety remain largely unknown. Here we show that anxiety influences social dominance in male outbred rats and identify an important mediating role for mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens. High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low-anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as decreased ATP and increased ROS production in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals. We conclude that mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens is crucial for social behavior and point to mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens as a potential marker and avenue of treatment for anxiety"

In this study, we found that the activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis protects cancer cells from ferroptosis, a form of regulated necrosis driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. This resistance is mediated by sustained activation of mTORC1 and the transcriptional induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central regulator of lipid metabolism. Furthermore, we show that SREBP1-mediated lipogenesis is required for ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells with PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway mutation. Finally, we demonstrate that the combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction is effective in preclinical models of cancer with PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway mutation. These findings suggest that ferroptosis may be a promising target for cancer therapy. (Show more)"

The most common drugs for treating hypertension are L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs), which are associated with an increased risk of heart failure. We show that LCCBs act on the N terminus of the Ca2+ sensor STIM to cause STIM relocalization to junctions and ORAI activation in a Cav1.2-independent and store depletion-independent manner. LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. This study unravels a mechanism of LCCBs action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrates that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. Our findings may help to explain the increased risk of heart failure associated with LCCBs and may lead to the development of new strategies for treating hypertension. This study also provides a rationale for the use of LCCBs in patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling."

Our findings underscore the need to continue to protect older forests and to ensure that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure. The NWFP is a unique opportunity to evaluate the influence of policy. Our findings have implications for the conservation of biodiversity in the face of climate change."

To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

The vector of the disease is still debated, with the most common hypothesis being that rats were responsible for the spread of the disease. However, there is little evidence to support this hypothesis. Here, we present a model for plague transmission by human ectoparasites, which is supported by the best fit to mortality curves from nine outbreaks in Europe. Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1347–1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats. This study also highlights the importance of using a Bayesian approach to model fitting, which allows for uncertainty in the model parameters. This approach is particularly important when studying historical epidemics, where there is often little evidence to support the model assumptions. Our results show that the model can be used to test hypotheses about the vector of plague, and that the model can be used to study the spread of plague in Europe during the Second Pandemic.

However, the evolution of brain information-processing capacity, which is the ultimate goal of neuroscience, has been neglected. This study provides a comprehensive reconstruction of the evolution of brain information-processing capacity across amniotes, which is the most inclusive group of tetrapods. We show that reptiles have not only small brains relative to body size but also low neuronal densities, resulting in average neuron numbers over 20 times lower than those in birds and mammals of similar body size. This has important implications for studies using relative brain size as a proxy when looking for evolutionary drivers of animal cognition. Our results suggest that the evolution of brain size and neuronal density are not independent of each other and that the evolution of brain size is not a good proxy for the evolution of brain information-processing capacity.

We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This study provides a mechanistic explanation for the role of TRAP1 in cancer and suggests that TRAP1 may be a promising target for cancer therapy. (Show more)"

However, the molecular mechanism by which ADF regulates actin dynamics is still not fully understood. Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to study the action of ADF in different mechanical situations. We find that ADF enhances severing of filaments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist. This ADF-induced torque dramatically enhances severing, which is critical to boost ADF’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for how ADF enhances actin filament disassembly and may help to understand how ADF is regulated in cells. They also provide a general framework for understanding how mechanical forces can enhance the activity of other proteins that bind to filaments. This framework may be applicable to other proteins that are involved in the disassembly of filament networks."

This study uses a quantitative approach to test the hypothesis that the evolution of an aquatic lifestyle is driving mammals toward a body size attractor in the water. We find that the evolution of an aquatic lifestyle is driving three of the four extant aquatic mammal clades toward a size attractor in the water. The existence of this size attractor and the relatively rapid selection toward, and limited deviation from, this attractor rule out most hypothesized drivers of size increase. These three independent body size increases and a shared aquatic optimum size are consistent with control by differences in the scaling of energetic intake and cost functions with body size between the terrestrial and aquatic realms. The optimum size occurs at an intermediate value where thermoregulatory costs are low but feeding efficiency remains high. Rather than being released from size pressures, water-dwelling mammals are driven and confined to larger body sizes by the strict energetic demands of the aquatic medium. This study provides a quantitative test of the energetic constraints on the evolution of body size in mammals. It also provides a framework for understanding the evolution of body size in other aquatic organisms."

This temperature-dependent induction of antiviral defense response correlates with higher levels of type I and type III IFNs and ISGs at 37 °C. These findings demonstrate that in mouse airway cells, rhinovirus replicates preferentially at nasal cavity temperature due, in part, to a less efficient antiviral defense response of infected cells at cool temperature.

Here we use a combination of advanced mass-spectrometry methods to study the folding of the maltose binding protein, a large protein that folds in a well-characterized two-state manner. We find that the folding process is highly heterogeneous, with a fast collapse into a polyglobular state and a slower formation of a distinct folding intermediate. The intermediate is a native-like structure that is formed by segments that are distant in the sequence but adjacent in the native protein. The intermediate is a step on the folding pathway and is a structure that must be formed before the native state can be reached.

However, the predominant Np4 decapping enzyme in bacteria, ApaH, is inactivated by the very conditions of disulfide stress that enable Np4-capped RNAs to accumulate to high levels. Here, we show that, in Escherichia coli cells experiencing such stress, the RNA pyrophosphohydrolase RppH assumes a leading role in decapping those transcripts, preferring them as substrates over their triphosphorylated and diphosphorylated counterparts. This enzyme recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5′ termini, resulting in a one-nucleotide shift in substrate specificity. The unconventional manner in which RppH recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress.

Finally, we highlight that the mass of humans is an order of magnitude higher than that of all wild mammals combined and report the historical impact of humanity on the global biomass of prominent taxa, including mammals, fish, and plants. Our results provide a global view of the biomass of the biosphere and its distribution among the kingdoms of life. They are"

SOC systems are characterized by a nontrivial scaling behavior of their fluctuations, which is reflected in the scaling of their critical exponents. In this paper, we report on our discovery of a continuous model of SOC, which is a certain scaling limit of the well-known sandpile model. We discuss the dichotomy between continuous and discrete models and their relation to pattern formation and proportional growth phenomena. Our aim is to present an idealized tropical toy model, requiring further investigation."

However, it is difficult to be well represented in current climate models. This is due to the complexity of ACI processes, such as the influence of aerosols on water cloud droplet formation. To overcome this conundrum, we introduce the dual-field-of-view (FOV) high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) for simultaneously profiling aerosol and water cloud properties, especially water cloud microphysical properties. This instrument, verified by the Monte Carlo simulation and coincident observations of other techniques, was used to conduct a case study over Beijing. The observations show that increased aerosol loading led to increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius, but had no discernible increase on liquid water path. This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations obtained from the dual-FOV HSRL constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI process.

We also found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation.

We find that low humidity impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in mice deficient in caspase-1/11, an enzyme involved in host defense against influenza virus infection. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

We find that fossil-fuel-related emissions account for about 65% of the excess mortality, and 70% of the climate cooling by anthropogenic aerosols. The chemical influence of air pollution on aeolian dust contributes to the aerosol cooling. Since aerosols mask the anthropogenic rise in global temperature, removing fossil-fuel-generated particles liberates 0.51(±0.03) °C and all pollution particles 0.73(±0.03) °C warming, reaching around 2 °C over North America and Northeast Asia.

We present the largest collection of ancient Yersinia pestis genomes to date, which allowed us to explore the diversity of this pathogen during the formative years of its evolution. Our results reveal a single lineage of plague that persisted over millennia without significant diversification, accompanied by rapid dispersal across continents. We also discover the presence of a flea-adapted form of plague in Bronze Age Iberia, previously only identified in the Caucasus and the Volga regions, suggesting a much wider geographic spread of this form of plague. Together, these data reveal the dynamic nature of plague’s formative years in terms of its early evolution and ecology.

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, in the days (Studies 1 and 2) and months (Studies 3 through 6) following the 2016 American presidential election, women’s and men’s endorsement of HM predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. In addition, as conceptualized, HM was associated with less trust in the government (Study 3), more sexism (Study 4), more racism (Study 5), and more xenophobia (Study 6) but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors.

This has resulted in massive losses of soil organic carbon (SOC) to the atmosphere. In this study, we show that soil health management practices can increase SOC storage and the distribution of SOC between particulate and mineral-associated fractions. These practices can be used to mitigate the effects of intensive agriculture on SOC and can be applied to existing cropland and grassland. Our results highlight the potential of well-managed grasslands to sequester carbon and provide a pathway to climate-smart agriculture.

This heterogeneity is associated with a high frequency of artificial skull deformations, which were used to modify the appearance of women. Our results suggest that the genetic history of Europe is more complex than previously thought and that complex demographic processes during the Early Medieval period may have contributed in an unexpected way to shape the modern European genetic landscape."

We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. First, whereas MERS-CoV prefers human DPP4 over bat DPP4 as its receptor, HKU4 shows the opposite trend. Second, in the absence of exogenous proteases, both MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes mediate pseudovirus entry into bat cells, whereas only MERS-CoV spike, but not HKU4 spike, mediates pseudovirus entry into human cells. Thus, MERS-CoV, but not HKU4, has adapted to use human cells for cross-species transmission. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4.

We found that the pol δ holoenzyme is stable and maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA.

One such color change is the presence of high concentrations of biliverdin, a pigment that is normally found in the blood of vertebrates. This study shows that the presence of high concentrations of biliverdin in anurans (frogs and toads) has evolved multiple times during their evolutionary history, and that this phenomenon is linked to the presence of a specific group of proteins that bind biliverdin. These proteins, hereafter named biliverdin-binding serpins, are most similar to human antitrypsin, but with a remarkable functional diversification. Our results present molecular and functional evidence of recurrent evolution of chlorosis, describe a biliverdin-binding protein in vertebrates, and introduce a function for a member of the serpin superfamily, the largest and most ubiquitous group of protease inhibitors. This study provides a molecular and functional explanation for the evolution of chlorosis and its diverse functions. (Show more)"

This pandemic is generally understood as the consequence of a singular introduction of Yersinia pestis, after which the disease established itself in European rodents over four centuries. To locate these putative plague reservoirs, we studied the climate fluctuations that preceded regional plague epidemics, based on a dataset of 7,711 georeferenced historical plague outbreaks and 15 annually resolved tree-ring records from Europe and Asia. We provide evidence for repeated climate-driven reintroductions of the bacterium into European harbors from reservoirs in Asia, with a delay of 15 ± 1 y.

It is also one of the most challenging to model, as it involves the loss of a major metabolic pathway and the acquisition of a new lifestyle. Here, we show that the transition to a parasitic lifestyle, characterized by the parasite’s dependence on a host to fulfill its life cycle, rather than the loss of photosynthesis, is linked to the relaxation of functional constraints on plastid genes. Our findings suggest that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner. This evolutionary trajectory may be relevant to other transitions from autotrophy to heterotrophy. This work also provides a framework for the study of the molecular evolution of plastid genomes.

However, model adequacy and insufficient horizontal resolution make it difficult to precisely quantify the changing likelihood of extreme droughts, given the small regional scale. Here, we use a high-resolution large ensemble to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the probability of occurrence of multiyear SSA rainfall deficits in past and future decades. We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% by the year 2100 under an intermediate-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5) and to 80% under a high-emission scenario (SSP5-8.5).

This reaction is catalyzed by two unrelated cyclase enzymes using different chemistries. The majority of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria use BchE, an O2-sensitive [4Fe-4S] cluster protein, whereas plants, cyanobacteria, and some phototrophic bacteria possess an O2-dependent enzyme, the major catalytic component of which is a diiron protein, AcsF. Plant and cyanobacterial mutants in ycf54 display impaired function of the O2-dependent enzyme, accumulating the reaction substrate. Swapping cyclases between cyanobacteria and purple phototrophic bacteria reveals three classes of the enzyme.

The etiology of ASD is so complicated that it is difficult to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility in ASD and may facilitate the development of new treatments for ASD. (Show more)"

Rather, the coaggregating proteins are supersaturated even more than the native interaction partners, suggesting that they are metastable in motor neurons. Thus, the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in ALS results from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

These associations are often highly specific, with only one or a few microbes colonizing a host for extended periods. The mechanisms that regulate the activities of these microbes are poorly understood. Here, we show that the symbiotic association between the squid Euprymna scolopes and its bioluminescent symbiont Vibrio fischeri is regulated by the host’s provision of a single glycan, chitin. This glycan is provided just before dusk, when the squid’s symbiotic organ is at its most stable, and is catabolized by the symbiont only at night, when the organ is producing light. This glycan-dependent regulation of the symbiont population and organ function may be a general mechanism for regulating the activities of specific microbes in the host’s epithelium. (Show more)"

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis remain unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We found that the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion. For the N3-EtdT lesion that disrupts base pairing, multiple transcriptional lesion bypass routes were found. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop).

To better understand how sequential proteolysis contributes to MERS-CoV infection, we introduced mutations that blocked the first cleavages during virus-producing cell secretion. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection, but had little effect on infection into other cell types. These findings suggest that the first cleavages are significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence. The first cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence. The results also suggest that the first cleavages are important for virus trafficking into endosomes, where the more rigid uncleaved MERS viruses are less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lack sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence.

We found that treatment of breast cancer cells with chemotherapy increased the expression of the type I tyrosine kinaselike orphan receptor ROR1, which in turn enhanced the capacity of breast cancer cells to invade Matrigel, form spheroids, engraft in Rag2−/−γc−/− mice, or survive treatment with paclitaxel. We also found that treatment of mice bearing breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) with the humanized anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab repressed expression of genes associated with breast cancer stemness, reduced activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or BMI1, and impaired the capacity of breast cancer PDXs to metastasize or reengraft Rag2−/−γc−/− mice. Finally, treatment of PDX-bearing mice with cirmtuzumab and paclitaxel was more effective than treatment with either alone in eradicating breast cancer PDXs.

The volcanic eruptions are associated with stratospheric ozone depletion, which likely contributed to the changes in climate and the rate of deglaciation. This study provides a unique example of how volcanic eruptions can be used to link climate change to specific events in the Earth system.

This DLK-independent regeneration is linked to a well-studied form of endogenous activity-dependent ectopic axon outgrowth in the same neuron type. These connections suggest that ectopic regeneration represents a powerful platform for gene discovery in neuronal regeneration. Moreover, we note numerous similarities between DLK-independent regeneration and lesion conditioning, a phenomenon producing robust regeneration in the mammalian CNS.

Here, we used a nonfluctuating signal, related to total brain activity, to identify and validate reproducible resting state networks in healthy and disease populations.

However, these factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we use high-throughput experiments to investigate how changes in temperature affect the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We found that changes in temperature systematically altered the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures departed from ambient conditions the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increased, meaning that more species were required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. Our findings have important implications for the design of conservation and management strategies, as well as for the assessment of the impacts of climate change on ecosystem functioning.

Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner.

Herein, we demonstrate the feasibility of delivering biomolecules to plants with DNA nanostructures. We show that the size, shape, compactness, stiffness, and attachment location of the DNA nanostructure are the key design parameters for the internalization and gene silencing efficiency. Our work establishes the feasibility of delivering biomolecules to plants with DNA nanostructures and also details the design parameters of importance for plant cell internalization and also assesses the impact of DNA nanostructure geometry for gene silencing mechanisms. This work opens up a new avenue for the delivery of biomolecules to plants and the development of plant-based therapeutics.

We show that nutrient inputs from small tributaries are disproportionately high in coastal areas, where they can fuel algal blooms. We also show that small tributaries are more likely to deliver nutrients in a dissolved form, which is more bioavailable to algae. Our findings suggest that nutrient management efforts should focus on small tributaries, which are often overlooked in current efforts. This could help reduce the ecological impacts of nutrient pollution on valuable nearshore ecosystems."

Here we show that NMDAR-Ab–related changes in cortical microcircuitry can predispose brain dynamics to paroxysmal abnormalities. We validate a dynamic causal model of NMDAR-Ab effects on cortical microcircuitry and use this model to identify the key synaptic parameters that best explain EEG paroxysms in pediatric patients with NMDAR-Ab encephalitis. Finally, we show that NMDAR-Ab–related changes render microcircuitry critically susceptible to overt EEG paroxysms when these key parameters are changed, even though the same parameter fluctuations are tolerated in the in silico model of the control condition. These findings offer mechanistic insights into circuit-level dysfunction induced by NMDAR-Ab.

We show that RSPO certification reduces tropical forest loss in Indonesia, the world’s largest producer and consumer of palm oil. However, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Our results suggest that certification has failed to reduce deforestation in Indonesia, and that certification may be contributing to the conversion of forests to oil palm. We argue that broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations are necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our findings highlight the need for more rigorous evaluation of the effectiveness of certification schemes. (Show more)"

In many species, sex determination is binary, with two sexes and two sexes only. However, in many other species, sex determination is polygenic, with multiple alleles segregating within a single species, allowing for more than two genotypic sexes. Here we investigate the effects of polygenic sex determination in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii, where two alleles, one of which determines female sex, interact to produce four possible sexes. We find that polygenic sex determination can produce modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics, and that the introgression of a newly acquired sex determiner can create additional axes of variation for varied traits. These results provide context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations. (Show more)"

We sought to understand how Fe levels impact the retina, given that retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are also challenged by accumulations of bisretinoids that photogenerate reactive oxygen species and photodecompose into damaging aldehyde- and dicarbonyl-bearing species. We found that Fe levels impact the retina in two ways: (i) increased Fe levels promote the oxidation and degradation of bisretinoids, and (ii) decreased Fe levels promote the oxidation of A2E. These findings have implications for the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in the elderly. They also suggest that Fe chelation may be a useful strategy for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration. This interpretation is supported by experiments showing that Fe chelation decreases the oxidation of A2E in the presence of light and reduces cell death in cell-based experiments. Moreover, light-independent oxidation and degradation of A2E by Fenton chemistry products was evidenced by the consumption of A2E, release of dicarbonyls, and generation of"

Here we show that the third metacarpal styloid process, a key derived feature of the human hand, was present in a Middle Pleistocene hominin from Kenya ∼1.42 My old. This fossil thus provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key shared derived characteristic of modern human and Neandertal hand morphology and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato.

One such vulnerability is the deficiency of one-carbon units, which are essential for cell growth. The enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) converts serine into glycine and a tetrahydrofolate-bound one-carbon unit. Here we show that dual SHMT1/2 knockout blocks HCT-116 colon cancer tumor xenograft formation. We then identify small-molecule dual inhibitors of human SHMT1/2, and show that they are effective in vitro and in vivo. We also show that one-carbon donor formate is a potent inhibitor of SHMT, and that SHMT inhibition increases the cytotoxicity of formate in DLBCL cell lines. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of DLBCL. This work provides a foundation for the development of SHMT inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy for cancer.

This has led to a chronic risk of subsoil compaction, which has been shown to have adverse effects on soil functioning and crop productivity. We show that this risk has been increasing over time, with the risk of subsoil compaction now affecting 20% of arable land. This alarming trend calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery, considering intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest land animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the recent discovery of a 150-m-long, 10-m-wide, and 3-m-deep trackway of a sauropod in the Morrison Formation of Colorado. This trackway is the longest and deepest trackway of any animal in the world. It provides compelling"
