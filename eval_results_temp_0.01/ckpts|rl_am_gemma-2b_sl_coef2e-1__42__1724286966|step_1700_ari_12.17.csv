Here we present a genomic and transcriptomic analysis of two distantly related species of myxozoans and a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results show that myxozoans are a sister group to the less reduced cnidarian parasite and that the transition from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic myxozoan was accompanied by a dramatic reduction in genome size and gene content. Our results provide insight into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Show more)

The virus has been shown to antagonize the antiviral action of interferon (IFN) by blocking nuclear import of transcription factors. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 encodes a protein, Orf6, that localizes at the nuclear pore complex and interacts with the Nup98-Rae1 complex to block nuclear import of importin/karyopherin. This mechanism of viral antagonism is likely to be common among other viruses that use the Nup98-Rae1 complex to block nuclear import of transcription factors. Our study provides a molecular understanding of the viral mechanism of action and may lead to the development of antiviral strategies. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of proton channels, but the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels is not completely understood. Here, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

In this study, we quantify the impact of climate change on maize yields and variability in the major maize-producing and -exporting countries. We find that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields will increase to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. They also underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance. This study is important for the food security of the world and the stability of the global economy. It is also important for the agricultural sector of the countries that produce and export the most maize."

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because of the difficulty of species-level identification of plant remains in traditional analyses. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammal species in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This study highlights the importance of diet composition in understanding the role of large herbivores in ecosystems. (Show more)"

However, whether personality traits may predispose individuals to a particular rank remains unclear. Here we show that anxiety directly influences social dominance in male outbred rats and identify an important mediating role for mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens. High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low-anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as decreased ATP and increased ROS production in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious individuals.

We used a grid-based approach to sample the genomic diversity across the island. We find that Madagascar is a mosaic of African and Asian ancestry, with a recent settlement. However, the distribution of ancestry across the island reveals that the settlement was not homogeneous across the island, suggesting that the settlement happened in several independent waves. In addition, we show that a few centuries are sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. This study provides a unique view of the history of Madagascar. It also provides a framework to study the history of other islands in the Indian Ocean."

In bacteria, Np4 decapping is critical for the rapid degradation of Np4-capped RNAs, which are often produced in response to stress. Here, we show that the RNA pyrophosphohydrolase RppH, which is inactivated by Np4, is the predominant decapping enzyme in cells experiencing stress. We demonstrate that RppH decapsulates Np4-capped RNAs by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to decapsulate other RNAs. This enzyme prefers Np4-capped RNAs as substrates, generating triphosphorylated RNA as the primary product of decapping. The unconventional manner in which RppH recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress.

They are also involved in many diseases, such as heart failure, epilepsy, and hypertension. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel is a major contributor to the resting membrane potential of the heart. It is also involved in the regulation of blood pressure and heart rate. The BK channel normally shows no C-type inactivation, but we found that it can exhibit slow C-type inactivation. We propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. This study may provide a new perspective for the study of ion channels and their diseases. (Show more)"

Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

This pattern of activity is consistent with a merge operation that applies equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity. More superficial models of language, based on sequential transition probabilities, only captured activity in the posterior middle temporal gyrus. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases.

The auditory organs of animals are diverse in structure and function, but all are part of the body of the animal. Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. The web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to capture the sound-induced air particle movements that approach the maximum physical efficiency better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself. The spider also enables the flexibility to functionally adjust and regularly regenerate its external ""eardrum"" according to its needs. The outsourcing and supersizing of auditory function in spiders provide unique features for studying extended and regenerative sensing and designing novel acoustic flow detectors for precise fluid dynamic measurement and manipulation.

This could be up to 5.55 million per year by additionally controlling nonfossil anthropogenic sources. Globally, fossil-fuel-related emissions account for about 65% of the excess mortality, and 70% of the climate cooling by anthropogenic aerosols. The chemical influence of air pollution on aeolian dust contributes to the aerosol cooling. Since aerosols mask the anthropogenic rise in global temperature, removing fossil-fuel-generated particles liberates 0.51 °C and all pollution particles 0.73 °C warming, reaching around 2 °C over North America and Northeast Asia. The steep temperature increase from removing aerosols can be moderated to about 0.36 °C globally by the simultaneous reduction of tropospheric ozone and methane. We conclude that a rapid phaseout of fossil-fuel-related emissions and major reductions of other anthropogenic sources are needed to save millions of lives,"

IBD is a heterogeneous disease, and the exact pathogenesis is still unclear. In this study, we found that retinoic acid-related orphan receptor α (RORα) is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis by attenuating nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcriptional activity. RORα deletion leads to excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis reveals corecruitment of RORα and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) on NF-κB target promoters and subsequent dismissal of CREB binding protein (CBP) and bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) for transcriptional repression. Together, we demonstrate that RORα/HDAC3-mediated attenuation of NF-κB signaling controls the balance of inflammatory responses, and therapeutic strategies targeting this epigenetic regulation could be beneficial to the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, including IBD.

We demonstrate that IL1RAP is expressed on candidate leukemic stem cells in the majority of AML patients and that monoclonal antibodies targeting IL1RAP have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We also show that an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling can suppress the proliferation of primary human AML cells. These results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This study also provides a proof of principle for the use of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based therapy of other diseases. (Show more)"

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

Here we present 10 ancient parvovirus genomes from humans who lived ∼0.5 to ∼6.9 thousand years ago. We find that the most recent common ancestor of all parvoviruses lived ∼12.6 thousand years ago. We also find that the recombination event that formed the human parvovirus B19 occurred ∼5.0–6.8 thousand years ago.

However, the molecular mechanisms of alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis remain unknown. In this work, we systematically investigated the impact of alkylation on transcription. We found that the transcription stalls at alkylated DNA template and that the stalling is exacerbated by the proofreading activity of RNA polymerase II. We also found that the transcription stalls at alkylated DNA template can be bypassed by the normal error-prone or error-free routes. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II that is involved in modulating the translocation of alkylated DNA template.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. We found that the sequential proteolysis of MERS-CoV S proteins is required for efficient infection of human lung-derived cells. This requirement for sequential proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence. © 2016, The Author(s).

Our experiments identify a JNK-dependent feedback amplification loop between intestinal tumors and the microbiome.

Finally, we found that targeting ROR1 with the humanized anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab was associated with reduced expression of genes associated with breast cancer stemness, reduced activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or BMI1, and reduced capacity of breast cancer PDXs to metastasize or reengraft Rag2−/−γc−/− mice.

However, these factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we show that the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is sensitive to changes in temperature. We found that the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning becomes steeper as temperatures deviate from ambient conditions, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This result is driven by two processes linked to the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. First, more diverse communities have a greater chance of including species with thermal traits that enable them to maintain productivity as temperatures shift from ambient conditions. Second, we found a pronounced increase in the contribution of complementarity to the net biodiversity effect at high and low temperatures, indicating that changes in species interactions played a critical role in mediating the impacts of temperature change on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. This study highlights the importance of considering the combined effects of biodiversity loss and environmental warming on ecosystem functioning. (Show more)"

Thus, they are dependent on the delivery of biomolecules to the cell for survival. In this work, we demonstrate that DNA nanostructures can be used to deliver biomolecules across the cell wall of plants. We show that the size, shape, compactness, stiffness, and attachment location of the DNA nanostructures are important design parameters for the delivery and gene silencing efficiency. This work establishes the feasibility of DNA nanostructures for biomolecule delivery to plants and also details the design parameters of importance for gene silencing mechanisms. This work is expected to be useful for the development of DNA nanostructures for the delivery of biomolecules to plants for the development of new crops and the improvement of existing crops. This work also provides a platform for the development of DNA nanostructures for the delivery of biomolecules to other organisms."

However, our understanding of the relative importance of small tributaries is limited by the lack of data. Here, we present a snapshot of nutrient inputs from nearly all tributaries of Lake Michigan, the world’s fifth largest freshwater lake by volume. We find that small tributaries deliver a disproportionately large amount of nutrients to the lake, especially in the form of dissolved inorganic nutrients. This suggests that small tributaries may be a significant source of coastal nutrient pollution. Our findings highlight the need to expand efforts to manage nutrient pollution from small tributaries to protect valuable nearshore ecosystems."

The mechanisms underlying these paroxysms are poorly understood. Here we show that the presence of an antibody against a specific type of glutamate receptor can change the dynamics of the brain, making it more susceptible to paroxysmal symptoms. This mechanism may be relevant to a large number of autoimmune encephalitis cases, and may be a useful target for treatment. This work offers insights into the mechanisms of autoimmune encephalitis and may be relevant to other disorders in which the immune system attacks the brain. This article is protected by copyright.

To understand the potential for future abrupt climate change, it is important to understand the history of abrupt climate change in the past. Here, we present a case study of an abrupt climate change that occurred ∼304 Ma. We show that this event was associated with a doubling of atmospheric CO2 and a biodiversity nadir. We also show that this event was linked to an increase in nutrient flux and thermocline stratification. These results provide insights into the potential for future abrupt climate change.

We show that RSPO certification is associated with reduced deforestation in Indonesia, the world’s leading producer of palm oil. However, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results highlight the importance of certification in reducing tropical deforestation, but also the need for more stringent requirements to avoid forest loss in noncertified areas.

In humans, its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. In plants, the exocyst complex is essential for the proper functioning of the plant cell. However, the study of the dynamic regulation of the exocyst-related processes using mutants in genetically tractable organisms such as Arabidopsis thaliana is limited by the severity of phenotypes. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 (exocyst component of 70 kDa) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

In many vertebrates, sex is determined by a single gene, but in others, multiple genes interact to produce multiple genotypic sexes. Here we investigate the effects of multiple interacting sex determination alleles in a fish species. We find that the modularity of secondary sexual characteristics produced by multiple interacting sex determination alleles can provide context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations. Our results suggest that the maintenance of multiple genotypic sexes may be a common evolutionary outcome of the evolution of multiple sex determination alleles.

We sought to understand how the levels of the intracellular iron (Fe) that supports redox active energy and electron transfer impact the retina. We found that Fe levels in the retina are tightly regulated and that Fe accumulation promotes the oxidation and degradation of a class of adducts that are implicated in the loss of photoreceptor cells. These findings have implications for the treatment of retinal diseases and for the development of strategies to protect the retina from oxidative stress. (Read more)

Despite the discovery of relatively complete hands from two early hominin species (Ardipithecus ramidus and Australopithecus sediba) and partial hands from another (Australopithecus afarensis), fundamental questions remain about the evolution of the human hand. These questions are driven by the paucity of hand fossils in the hominin fossil record between 800,000 and 1.8 My old, a time interval well documented for the emergence and subsequent proliferation of Acheulian technology. We show that the third metacarpal styloid process was present ∼1.42 Mya in an East African hominin from Kaitio, West Turkana, Kenya. This fossil thus provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key shared derived characteristic of modern human and Neandertal hand morphology and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato."

We show that the increase in mechanization has led to higher vehicle weights that have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis calls for a reexamination of the ecological history of sauropods."
