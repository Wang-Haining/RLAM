However, the structure of hydrate formed by a noble gas, such as neon, is still unknown. In this work, we report the structure of neon hydrate at high pressure and temperature. The structure of neon hydrate is similar to that of ice II, which is a unique structure of water. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The structure of neon hydrate is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. This work provides a new understanding of the structure of hydrate formed by a noble gas. It also provides a new way to store noble gases. This work is expected to be of great interest to many fields. This work is expected to be of great interest to many fields."

A central issue is the nature of the mathematical structure underlying quantum theory. In this paper, we provide a purely categorical approach to this problem. Our approach is based on the observation that quantum mechanics is a special case of a more general theory of linear operators on Hilbert spaces. We show that the category of continuous linear operators on Hilbert spaces is equivalent to the category of quantum states on a von Neumann algebra. This result provides a mathematical foundation for quantum mechanics that is purely categorical and does not presuppose any analytical structure. Our approach is based on the work of von Neumann, Mackey, Jauch, Piron, Abramsky, and Coecke. It is a significant advance over previous work because it is purely categorical and does not rely on the axiom of choice. It also provides a more general framework than previous work. For example, it allows one to consider quantum theories that are not based on von Neumann algebras. Our approach has applications to the foundations of quantum information theory. It provides a mathematical foundation for quantum information theory that is purely categorical and does not rely on the axiom of choice. It also provides a more general framework than previous work."

In this study, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the genomes of two distantly related myxozoans, which allowed us to compare the genomes of these parasites to those of other parasites and to a free-living cnidarian. Our results suggest that the extreme reduction in genome size and gene content of the Myxozoa is not the result of a single event but rather the result of a series of reductions that occurred over the course of evolution.

The virus has been shown to antagonize the antiviral action of interferon (IFN) by blocking nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2. In this study, we show that the viral accessory protein ORF6 is responsible for this anti-IFN activity. We found that ORF6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain. We also show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs ORF6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its anti-IFN activity. Our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. Sperm cells are quiescent in the male reproductive system due to Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1 channels, but become active once introduced into the low-Zn2+-concentration environment of the female reproductive tract. How Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide"

Here, we quantify the impact of climate change on maize production and yield variability in the major maize-producing and -exporting countries. We find that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields will increase to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the 800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. They also underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance."

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa in the field. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large herbivores in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results highlight the importance of diet composition in understanding the structure and functioning of LMH communities. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

However, whether personality traits may predispose individuals to a particular rank remains unclear. Here we show that anxiety directly influences social dominance in rats and identify an important mediating role for mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens. High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low-anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as decreased ATP and increased ROS production in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious individuals. We conclude that mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens is crucial for social hierarchy establishment and is critically involved in the low social competitiveness associated with high anxiety.

The major drugs for treating hypertension are L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs). However, the use of LCCBs is associated with an increased risk of heart failure. Here, we show that LCCBs activate Ca2+ signaling pathways that promote vascular remodeling. Our data indicate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. Our findings may help to understand the mechanism of LCCBs action and may lead to the development of new strategies for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure.

We also show that the early-seral ecosystem area has stabilized, but declined in two ecoregions—the Coast Range and Cascades—along with early-seral bird populations. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure.

Here, we show that APOE isoform regulates the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes in a manner that is highly dependent on APOE isoform. We also show that APOE4 is associated with increased accumulation of complement component C1q in the brain, which may contribute to the increased susceptibility of APOE4 to AD. These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes. They also suggest the hypothesis that APOE4 susceptibility to AD may originate in part from defective phagocytic capacity of astrocytes that accelerates the rate of accumulation of senescent synapses, enhancing synaptic vulnerability to classical-complement-cascade mediated neurodegeneration. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that APOE4 is associated with increased levels of the complement regulatory protein, APOE2, which may enhance the rate of synapse pruning"

However, the function of TRAP1 in normal cells is less clear. Here we show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. Thus, our results suggest that TRAP1 may be a promising target for cancer therapy. However, the precise nature of its function in normal cells must be clarified before this can be achieved.

In bacteria, Np4 decapping is mediated by the enzyme ApaH, which is inactivated by stress conditions that enable Np4 accumulation. Here, we show that, in the presence of stress, the pyrophosphohydrolase RppH is the predominant decapping enzyme in Escherichia coli, and that it prefers to decape Np4-capped RNAs over their tri- and diphosphorylated counterparts. This preference is due to a unique mechanism of substrate recognition, in which the δ-phosphate of the Np4 cap is positioned for attack by the active site of the enzyme, generating a monophosphorylated RNA as the primary product of decapping. This work reveals a previously unknown role for RppH in RNA metabolism and provides a mechanistic explanation for the differential impact of Np4 on the rates at which capped and noncapped RNAs are degraded.

The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We induced C-type inactivation in BK channels and studied the relationship between activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery. We observed prominent slow C-type inactivation/recovery in BK channels by an extreme low concentration of extracellular K+ together with a Y294E/K/Q/S or Y279F mutation whose equivalent in Shaker channels (T449E/K/D/Q/S or W434F) caused a greatly accelerated rate of C-type inactivation or constitutive C-inactivation.

Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

Here, we show that soil health management practices that increase soil organic matter and microbial biomass, such as incorporating legumes and manure, can increase SOC storage in annual cropping systems. However, these practices did not significantly increase mineral-associated organic matter, which is the most recalcitrant fraction of SOC. In contrast, rotational grazing of pastures managed with rotational grazing increased mineral-associated organic matter and total SOC storage.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how HKU4 and HKU5 transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions. Our findings provide insights into the evolution of MERS-CoV and the origins of zoonotic coronaviruses. They also suggest that the"

We used metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) to investigate the pathogen landscape of undifferentiated fevers in a periurban population in Cambodia. We identified a variety of vector-borne, zoonotic, and emerging pathogens, including chikungunya virus, Plasmodium knowlesi, and HIV. Our findings highlight the importance of mNGS as a resource-efficient and scalable approach to pathogen surveillance in resource-scarce settings. Coordinated and ongoing mNGS pathogen surveillance can better identify the breadth of endemic, zoonotic, or emerging pathogens and deployment of rapid public health response. This approach can be applied to other resource-scarce settings to better understand the regional pathogen landscape and mitigate the spread of infectious diseases.

We found that the human pol δ–PCNA complex maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion.

This is a significant step toward the reconstruction of the RNA world because it allows the replication of RNA, which is a prerequisite for the evolution of genetic information. Furthermore, the polymerase can amplify RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold, which is a key step toward the development of a synthetic PCR.

This glycan is catabolized by the symbiont, which is thus able to maintain a healthy population level only during the night. This is the first example of a host regulating the provision of a single nutrient to a specific symbiont, and it suggests that the provision of nutrients to specific symbionts may be a more common phenomenon than previously thought.

The etiology of autism is so complicated because it involves the effects of variants of several hundred risk genes along with the contribution of environmental factors. Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. As an alternative approach, extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying the convergence of the targets and functions of the autism-risk genes to facilitate mapping out causal paths. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. Our results indicate that the behavioral inflexibility of autism-risk gene mutants is caused by the inability to forget. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

These data expand our understanding of the phenotypic spectrum of dysregulated CRAC channel signaling, advance our knowledge of the molecular function of the CRAC channel, and suggest new therapies aiming at attenuating store-operated Ca2+ entry in the treatment of patients with Stormorken syndrome and related pathologic conditions.

The mechanisms underlying the propagation of protein aggregates in these diseases are poorly understood. Here we use a fluorescently tagged polyglutamine-expanded form of human huntingtin to monitor the spreading of aggregates in a model of Huntington’s disease. We show that aggregates accumulate at synaptic terminals and progressively spread throughout the brain. These aggregates are internalized and accumulate within other neurons. We demonstrate that the release of aggregates requires N-ethylmalemide–sensitive fusion protein 1, indicating that active release and uptake of aggregates are important elements of spreading and disease progression. Our results provide a model for the propagation of neurodegenerative disease and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies. This article is protected by copyright.

We show that augmentor ligands are essential for zebrafish pigment development and that these ligands are activated by Ltk and not by Alk. These experiments establish a physiological link between augmentor ligands and Ltk and demonstrate that particular augmentors activate Ltk in a tissue-specific context to induce iridophore differentiation from neural crest-derived cells and pigment progenitor cells.

Accumulating evidence indicates that STING plays an important role in the regulation of insulin sensitivity. However, its function in β-cells remains unknown. Herein, we revealed a distinct role of STING in the regulation of glucose homeostasis through peripheral tissues and β-cells. Specially, although STING beneficially alleviated insulin resistance and glucose intolerance induced by high-fat diet, it surprisingly impaired islet glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Importantly, STING-βKO caused glucose intolerance due to impaired GSIS, indicating that STING is required for normal β-cell function. Islet transcriptome analysis showed that STING deficiency decreased expression of β-cell function–related genes, including Glut2, Kcnj11, and Abcc8, contributing to impaired GSIS. Mechanistically, the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) and cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&amp;Tag) analyses suggested that Pax6 was the transcription factor that might be associated with defective GSIS in STING-βKO mice.

However, these threats are frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning becomes steeper, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. Our findings have important implications for the design of biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation strategies. They also highlight the need for a more holistic approach to the study of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning."

It encodes the spatial layout of the environment and the animal’s position within it. The organization of its neurons is critical for this function. Here, we used a portable two-photon microscope to record the activity of a large number of neurons in freely behaving mice. We found that grid cells, which encode the animal’s position in space, are anatomically distinct from border, head-direction, and object-vector cells. This suggests that grid cells might be organized in a network that is largely distinct from those of other cell types. Our results also suggest that grid cells are strongly coupled among themselves but have weaker links to other cell types. This organization might be important for the formation of the grid. Our method should be broadly applicable to the study of the topographic organization of neurons in the brain. It allows for the collection of precise anatomical and activity data across large populations of neurons during unrestrained behavior. This should help us understand how the brain encodes spatial information."

This study demonstrates that FTs can function as an important interplant flowering signal in host–parasite interactions. The unique means of flowering regulation of dodder illustrates how regressive evolution, commonly found in parasites, may facilitate the physiological synchronization of parasite and host, here allowing the C. australis parasite to time reproduction exactly with that of their hosts, likely optimizing parasite fitness. This study provides a new perspective on the evolution of flowering and flowering regulation. It also provides a new approach to study the evolution of flowering regulation.

Here, we describe a previously unidentified type of nigral cell–fiber integration that is likely to be important to the function of this system. We show that striatonigral fibers originating in striosomes form highly unusual bouquet-like arborizations that target bundles of ventrally extending dopamine-containing dendrites and clusters of their parent nigral cell bodies. These clustered cell bodies in turn project to the striatum as part of the classic nigrostriatal pathway. Thus, these striosome–dendron bouquets likely represent subsystems with the nigro–striato–nigral loop that are affected in human disorders including Parkinson’s disease. Given evidence that striosomes receive input from cortical regions related to the control of mood and motivation and that they link functionally to reinforcement and decision-making, the striosome–dendron bouquets could be critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease. This discovery has implications for our understanding of the function of the nigrostriatal pathway and its disorders.

But how do we know when we are connected? We asked people to talk with each other and rated the felt connection. We found that the speed at which people responded to each other predicted the felt connection. People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.” This is a signal that we can use to assess the quality of our connections."

We show that STIM1 is selectively expressed in SANCs and is required for the maintenance of SAN automaticity. Our results reveal that STIM1 regulates the electrical activity of SANCs by controlling the content of Ca2+ stores and the surface expression of channels that are responsible for the generation of the heart rate.

Our results suggest that Si may promote the accumulation of Si in leaves, which in turn may increase the availability of Si for the formation of Si-induced resistance. This process is mediated by JA, which may be important for Si-enhanced resistance against insect herbivores.

The mechanization of agriculture has increased the capacity of farm machinery, but it has also increased the weight of vehicles, which has led to the compaction of soil. We show that the weight of farm machinery has increased so much that it now exceeds the safe mechanical limits of soil. This has led to the widespread risk of subsoil compaction, which has the potential to reduce soil productivity. We hypothesize that the roaming of sauropods, the largest animals that walked Earth, may have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles."
