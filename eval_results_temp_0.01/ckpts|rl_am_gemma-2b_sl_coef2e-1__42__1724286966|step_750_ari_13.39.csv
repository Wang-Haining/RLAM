In this paper, we provide a categorical foundation for quantum mechanics. The axioms are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. This addresses a question about the mathematical foundations of quantum theory raised in reconstruction programs such as those of von Neumann, Mackey, Jauch, Piron, Abramsky, and Coecke."

Here, we present a comparative analysis of the genomes and transcriptomes of two distantly related myxozoan species and a less reduced cnidarian species. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content.

In this study, we describe a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. Our data reveal a previously unknown mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus uses the Nup98-Rae1 complex to block nuclear import of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are essential for induction of IFN-stimulated genes. Our findings have important implications for the development of antiviral strategies against SARS-CoV-2. Our data suggest that targeting the Nup98-Rae1 complex may represent a promising strategy to block the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to antagonize the antiviral response of the host. This strategy may be particularly effective in the context of a co-infected patient, in which the host is already under stress due to the presence of a second virus. Our findings may also have implications for the development of antiviral strategies against other viruses that use the Nup98-Rae1 complex to antagonize the antiviral response of the host.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. Sperm cells are quiescent in the male reproductive system due to Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1 channels, but become active once introduced into the low-Zn2+-concentration environment of the female reproductive tract. How Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide"

This study quantifies the impact of climate change on the variability of maize yields in major maize-producing and -exporting countries. We find that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields will increase to values much larger than present-day values in most of the world. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields. The probability that the top four maize-exporting countries have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. They also underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance."

However, the extent to which herbivore diversity is linked to species coexistence is unclear. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammalian herbivore species in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results highlight the need to consider the taxonomic resolution of diet data when assessing the role of herbivores in ecosystems. This is especially important for understanding the role of herbivore diversity in species coexistence.

Here we show that trait anxiety directly influences social dominance in male outbred rats and identify an important mediating role for mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens. High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low-anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as decreased ATP and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals. We conclude that mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens is crucial for social hierarchy establishment and is critically involved in the low social competitiveness associated with high anxiety.

IGF2BP1 is expressed in adult bone marrow and is silenced in fetal liver. IGF2BP1 overexpression in erythroid cells causes a nearly complete reversal of the adult hemoglobin expression pattern toward a more fetal-like phenotype. This is achieved by increased gamma-globin expression and decreased beta-globin expression. The fetal hemoglobin level achieved in these experiments is 68.6%.

Despite advances in treatment, many patients do not respond to therapy, and the majority of patients die of their disease. Cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and the mechanisms of resistance to therapy are complex. In this study, we identified a mechanism of resistance to ferroptosis, a form of regulated necrosis driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, in cancer cells. We found that mutation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis protects cancer cells from ferroptosis through induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. We also found that SREBP1 and its transcriptional target stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) mediate the ferroptosis-suppressing activity of SREBP1 by producing monounsaturated fatty acids. These findings suggest that targeting the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and inducing ferroptosis may be a promising strategy for cancer therapy. This strategy may be particularly effective in patients with cancer that harbors mutation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, such as in breast and prostate cancer."

Our findings unravel a mechanism of LCCBs action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI.

We used &gt;25 years of bird surveys to test the influence of this policy on biodiversity. Our results show that the NWFP halted the decline of early-seral–associated bird populations, but failed to reverse the decline of older-forest–associated species. This is partly because of the continued decline of older forests on federal land, partly because of the continued clearcutting of early-seral forests on private lands, and partly because of the lack of recovery of older-forest–associated bird populations. The NWFP is a unique opportunity to evaluate the influence of policy. Our findings highlight the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure."

The development of new antibiotics is a challenging task, since the evolution of pathogens is highly adaptive. Computational approaches are essential tools to this end since their application enables fast and early strategical decisions in the drug development process. We present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters, and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data.

We found that CTLA-4 deletion induced lymphoproliferation, hypergammaglobulinemia, and autoantibody production, accompanied by organ-specific autoantibodies. However, in contrast to congenital deficiency, this was not fatal. CTLA-4 deletion induced preferential expansion of CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells, but T cells from CTLA-4–deficient inducible KO mice were able to adoptively transfer the diseases into T cell-deficient mice.

Here, we describe a live attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate that is temperature sensitive in vitro and can be grown at the permissive temperature. The vaccine candidate is highly attenuated in vivo, resulting in milder disease and reduced weight loss in hamsters challenged with the virus. The vaccine candidate is also protective in hamsters challenged with the virus. These results support the potential of the vaccine candidate for use in mass vaccination programs.

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal and transformed cells is more complex than previously appreciated. We have shown that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor.

It does so by binding to the barbed end of actin filaments and severing them. However, how it does so in a physiological context, where filaments are interconnected and under mechanical stress, remains unclear. Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to study the action of ADF in different mechanical situations. We find that filament curvature favors severing, while tension has no effect on cofilin binding and weakly enhances severing. We also find that filament segments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist, experience a mechanical torque upon cofilin binding. We propose that this ADF-induced torque dramatically enhances severing. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. Our findings have implications for understanding the role of ADF in a variety of cellular processes, including cell motility and cytokinesis. They also provide a general framework for understanding the action of other proteins that sever filaments in a mechanical context."

We find that when positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks.

The disease is characterized by chronic inflammation, which is most often attributed to sustained microglial activation in response to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque deposits and cell death. However, this reaction is observed in transgenic animal models devoid of such pathologies. We propose that this plaque-independent inflammatory reaction originates from neurons burdened with increasing levels of soluble and oligomeric Aβ, which are known to be the most toxic amyloid species within the brain. Laser microdissection of neurons extracted from preplaque amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic rats revealed that neurons are the primary source of inflammatory factors, even in the absence of extracellular plaques and cell death. We also demonstrate within disease-vulnerable regions of the human brain that a neuron-specific inflammatory response may precede insoluble Aβ plaque and tau tangle formation. Thus, we identify the Aβ-burdened neuron as a significant immunological component in the AD pathogenesis.

Here, we show that, in such conditions, the RNA pyrophosphohydrolase RppH assumes a leading role in decapping alarmones. We demonstrate that RppH prefers to decape capped RNAs over their uncapped counterparts, and that the capping group is recognized by a mechanism distinct from the one used to recognize other 5′ termini. The unconventional manner in which RppH recognizes capped 5′ ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress.

Finally, we highlight that the mass of humans is an order of magnitude higher than that of all wild mammals combined and report the historical impact of humanity on the global biomass of prominent taxa, including mammals, fish, and plants. Our results provide a global view of the biomass of the biosphere and its distribution among the kingdoms of life. They"

Our model is continuous, in contrast to all known models of SOC, and is a certain scaling limit of the sandpile model, the first and archetypical model of SOC. We describe how our model is related to pattern formation and proportional growth phenomena and discuss the dichotomy between continuous and discrete models in several contexts. Our aim in this context is to present an idealized tropical toy model, requiring further investigation."

The structure is largely disordered and contains a single four-residue α-helix and one three-residue antiparallel β-sheet stabilized by two disulfide bonds. NCR044 peptide exhibited potent fungicidal activity against multiple plant fungal pathogens. It bound to multiple bioactive phosphoinositides in vitro. Time-lapse microscopy revealed that the peptide penetrated the fungal cell wall and membrane at discrete foci, followed by gradual loss of turgor, subsequent accumulation in the cytoplasm, and elevated levels in nucleoli of germlings. NCR044 spray-applied to tomato and tobacco plants significantly reduced gray mold disease symptoms caused by the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Our work illustrates the antifungal activity of a structurally unique NCR peptide against plant fungal pathogens and paves the way for future development of this class of peptides as a spray-on fungistat/fungicide.

We show that the sperm proteome undergoes substantial compositional changes after being transferred to the female reproductive tract. Multiple seminal fluid proteins initially associate with sperm, but most become undetectable after sperm are stored. Female-derived proteins also begin to associate with sperm immediately after mating, and they comprise nearly 20% of the postmating sperm proteome following 4 d of storage in the female reproductive tract. Female-derived proteins that associate with sperm are enriched for processes associated with energy metabolism, suggesting that female contributions support sperm viability during the prolonged period between copulation and fertilization.

They are also important for ion homeostasis and blood pressure regulation. Ion channels are regulated by their pore gates, which open and close the channel pore. Ion channels commonly possess two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that BK channel C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. Our findings provide insights into the regulation of ion channels and their physiological functions. They also provide a possible mechanism for the BK channel’s normal closing and its constitutive C-inactivation. Our findings may also have implications for the BK channel’s pathophysiological roles in hypertension. (Read less)"

In the temperate regions, seasonal influenza outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in ambient humidity. While low humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

We present 17 ancient Yersinia pestis genomes from Eurasia dating to the Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age (LNBA) period, which is considered a critical time for the emergence of plague. Our results show that plague was not a single lineage but rather a lineage that persisted for millennia without significant diversification. We also discover the presence of a flea-adapted form of plague in Bronze Age Iberia, suggesting a much wider geographic spread of this form of plague. Together, these data reveal the dynamic nature of plague’s formative years in terms of its early evolution and ecology. This study provides a unique perspective on the origins of plague and its impact on human history. Understanding the history of plague is important for the development of effective countermeasures against the disease today. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, in the days (Studies 1 and 2) and months (Studies 3 through 6) following the 2016 election, women’s and men’s endorsement of HM predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. In addition, as conceptualized, HM was associated with less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors. The findings highlight the importance of psychological examinations of masculinity as a cultural ideology to understand how men’s and women’s endorsement of HM legitimizes patriarchal dominance and reinforces gender, race, and class-based hierarchies via candidate support.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how HKU4 and HKU5 transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. First, whereas MERS-CoV prefers human DPP4 as its receptor, HKU4 shows the opposite trend. Second, in the absence of exogenous proteases, both MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes mediate pseudovirus entry into bat cells, whereas only MERS-CoV spike, but not HKU4 spike, mediates pseudovirus entry into human cells.

The polymerase responsible for this process is pol δ. In S. cerevisiae, the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is essential for every Okazaki fragment to be replicated before the polymerase dissociates from the sliding clamp. However, the stability of the human pol δ holoenzyme is unknown. We designed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. We found that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with the sliding clamp while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from the sliding clamp on stalling at a DNA lesion.

This phenomenon is called chlorosis. Chlorosis is thought to be a rare phenomenon, but we show that it has evolved multiple times in anurans (frogs and toads). We also show that the evolution of chlorosis is linked to the presence of a group of serpins that bind biliverdin, a pigment that is normally present in the blood. These serpins are most similar to human antitrypsin, but with a remarkable functional diversification. Our results provide evidence of recurrent evolution of chlorosis, describe a biliverdin-binding protein in vertebrates, and introduce a function for a member of the serpin superfamily, the largest and most ubiquitous group of protease inhibitors. This study provides a molecular and functional explanation for the evolution of green coloration. It also provides a molecular basis for the evolution of chlorosis, which is a phenomenon that is widespread in nature."

Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are responsible for initiating and maintaining tumor growth. We report that hypoxia induces expression of AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), which demethylates N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications on mRNA. ALKBH5 expression is increased in BCSCs and is required for BCSC maintenance. ALKBH5 expression is induced by hypoxia through the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), which also induce NANOG mRNA expression. NANOG mRNA methylation is dependent on ALKBH5, and NANOG mRNA demethylation increases NANOG protein levels. Thus, ALKBH5 expression is induced by hypoxia in BCSCs, which increases NANOG expression and the BCSC phenotype. This study provides insight into the molecular mechanisms that regulate BCSC phenotype in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. These findings may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for breast cancer. (PsycINFO Database Record"

The first pocket Bibles were made in the 13th century. The source of this parchment, often called “uterine vellum,” has been a long-standing controversy in codicology. Here, we report a simple and objective method to identify the animal origin of parchment. The noninvasive method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals; however, we did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides. These results suggest that ultrafine vellum does not necessarily derive from the use of abortive or newborn animals with ultrathin hides, but could equally well reflect a production process that allowed the skins of maturing animals of several species to be rendered into vellum of equal quality and fin"

The age model for this extinction is critical for understanding its cause and the controls on extinction/recovery dynamics. We present a new age model for the extinction based on U-Pb dating of volcanic ash beds. The age model is based on five ash beds, each of which is dated with a precision of ∼100 ka. The extinction occurred between 251.941 ± 0.037 and 251.880 ± 0.031 Mya, an interval of 60 ± 48 ka. The carbon cycle was highly volatile immediately preceding the extinction, and the carbon cycle continued to be volatile for ∼500 ka. This new age model will allow a refined evaluation of the relative roles of rate-dependent processes contributing to the extinction, allowing insight into postextinction ecosystem expansion. This work will also allow a more precise evaluation of the trigger and kill hypotheses for the extinction. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

RORαΔIEC mice exhibit excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs.

We also show that the D614G mutation increases the ability of the spike protein to bind to the receptor, ACE2. These results suggest that the D614G mutation may increase the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. This is an important finding because the current vaccines are based on the D614G spike.

Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action.

In this study, we synthesize the largest global dataset to date of soil respiration, moisture, and temperature measurements, totaling &gt;3,800 observations representing 27 temperature manipulation studies, spanning nine biomes and over 2 decades of warming. Our analysis reveals no significant differences in the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration between control and warmed plots in all biomes, with the exception of deserts and boreal forests. Thus, our data provide limited evidence of acclimation of soil respiration to experimental warming in several major biome types, contrary to the results from multiple single-site studies. Our analysis adds a unique cross-biome perspective on the temperature response of soil respiration, information critical to improving our mechanistic understanding of how soil carbon dynamics change with climatic warming.

It is also a major challenge for evolutionary theory, as it is difficult to reconcile the loss of photosynthesis with the maintenance of the plastid genome. We present a model of the trajectory of plastid genome evolution during the transition from autotrophy to a parasitic lifestyle. We show that the loss of photosynthesis is linked to the parasite’s dependence on a host to fulfill its life cycle, rather than the loss of photosynthesis itself. Our findings suggest that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner. During the functional reduction process, the elevation of evolutionary rates reaches several new rate equilibria, possibly relating to the modified protein turnover rates in heterotrophic plastids. This model may help to reconcile the paradox of the plastid genome in the history of life. It may also provide a framework for understanding the evolution of other organelle genomes in parasitic lineages. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

We use a high-resolution climate model to quantify the role of anthropogenic climate change in the occurrence of the 2015–2017 drought. We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% by the year 2100 under an intermediate-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5) and to 80% under a high-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5-8.5). These results highlight the strong sensitivity of the drought risk in SSA to future anthropogenic emissions.

Neuroinflammation is a complex process involving multiple cell types, including microglia, astrocytes, and neurons. Neuroinflammation is associated with the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, and thus, it is important to understand the mechanisms of neuroinflammation. In this study, we found that neuroinflammation was reduced in both the early and later stages of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in microglia/macrophage-specific ASK1 knockout mice, whereas only the later-stage neuroinflammation was ameliorated in astrocyte-specific ASK1 knockout mice. ASK1 signaling in microglia played a major role in generating and maintaining disease. Activated astrocytes produce key inflammatory mediators, including CCL2, that further activated and recruited microglia/macrophages, in an astrocytic ASK1-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that glial ASK1 is a promising therapeutic target for reducing neuroinflammation. This study provides insights into the pathophysiology of EAE and suggests a potential therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases.

The etiology of autism is so complicated because it involves the effects of variants of several hundred risk genes along with the contribution of environmental factors. Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. As an alternative approach, extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying the convergence of the targets and functions of the autism-risk genes to facilitate mapping out causal paths. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides"

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis remain unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We found that the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion. For the N3-EtdT lesion that disrupts base pairing, multiple transcriptional lesion bypass routes were found. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop).

In coordination with endogenous FOXC2 in fibroblasts, transduced ETV2 elicits expression of multiple key endothelial development factors, including FLI1, ERG, and TAL1, and induces expression of endothelial functional molecules, including EGFL7 and von Willebrand factor. Consequently, ETVECs exhibits EC characteristics in vitro and forms mature functional vasculature in Matrigel plugs transplanted in NOD SCID mice.

Indeed, STING-βKO caused glucose intolerance due to impaired GSIS, indicating that STING is required for normal β-cell function. Islet transcriptome analysis showed that STING deficiency decreased expression of β-cell function–related genes, including Glut2, Kcnj11, and Abcc8, contributing to impaired GSIS.

We also show that controlling the activity level of JNK signaling is critical to maintain epithelial barrier function and host–microbe homeostasis. Our study highlights the importance of controlling the activity of JNK signaling to maintain epithelial barrier function and host–microbe homeostasis. This work provides insights into the crosstalk between the tumor microenvironment and the microbiome and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.

We show that the expression of the orphan receptor tyrosine kinaselike orphan receptor ROR1 is increased in breast cancer cells following treatment with chemotherapy. This increase in ROR1 expression is associated with the activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or BMI1, which are important in regulating breast cancer stemness. Furthermore, we show that ROR1 expression is required for the ability of breast cancer cells to metastasize or reengraft Rag2−/−γc−/− mice. Finally, we show that treatment of mice bearing breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) with the humanized anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab and paclitaxel is more effective than treatment with either alone in eradicating PDXs. These results indicate that targeting ROR1 may improve the response to chemotherapy of patients with breast cancer. (PsycINFO Database Record"

We show that a series of volcanic eruptions at the start of deglaciation is a plausible cause. The eruptions led to stratospheric ozone depletion, which in turn caused a poleward shift in the Southern Hemisphere westerlies and a rapid advance of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. This is a unique link between volcanism and climate change, and it provides a mechanism for the start of deglaciation. The Mount Takahe eruptions are the most distant volcanic eruptions known to have caused climate change. The findings are important for understanding the causes of deglaciation and the potential impacts of volcanic eruptions on climate. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

We present a global map of riverine fisheries, which reveals that 90% of global catch comes from river basins with above-average stress levels. We also find that freshwater fisheries provide the equivalent of all dietary animal protein for 158 million people, highlighting the critical role of rivers in providing locally sourced, low-cost protein. At the same time, intensive fishing in regions where rivers are already degraded by other stressors may undermine efforts to conserve biodiversity. This syndrome of poverty, nutritional deficiency, fishery dependence, and extrinsic threats to biodiverse river ecosystems underscores the high stakes for improving fishery management. Our enhanced spatial data on estimated catches can facilitate the inclusion of inland fisheries in environmental planning to protect both food security and species diversity."

It is a key component of evolution, and its rate is a major determinant of the size of the genome. In this paper, we describe the distribution of recombination across the genome of a flowering plant, Mimulus guttatus. We find that recombination rates vary widely across the genome, with some regions showing no detectable recombination. We also find that recombination rates peak near the start of genes and fall off sharply, exhibiting polarity. These results are similar to those observed in yeast and in mice, suggesting that recombination initiation described here in Mimulus may reflect ancient and conserved eukaryotic mechanisms. This work provides a detailed view of the recombination landscape in a flowering plant, which is an important model for studying evolution.

The analysis of these fluctuations has led to the identification of networks of anatomically connected brain regions, which are functionally related. Here, we used metabolic imaging to identify and validate reproducible resting state networks in healthy and disease populations. We found that the dominant resting state network in healthy subjects was topographically similar to the default mode network. In contrast, in Parkinson’s disease, this RSN was subordinated to an independent disease-related pattern. Network functionality was assessed by quantifying metabolic RSN expression in cerebral blood flow PET scans acquired at rest and during task performance. We found that the dominant resting state network was deactivated during rest in healthy subjects and early Parkinson’s disease patients, and that this abnormality was partially corrected by dopaminergic therapy. In contrast, in Alzheimer’s disease, significant reductions in network expression were already present at diagnosis, progressing over time. Metabolic imaging can directly provide useful information regarding the resting organization of the brain in health and disease. This approach may be useful for the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases."

The role of fibrous sheath interacting protein 1 (FSIP1) in TNBC has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

Moreover, subjects with increased gut permeability also had altered composition and activity of the gut microbiota. These results suggest the existence of a gut–brain axis in alcohol dependence, which implicates the gut microbiota as an actor in the gut barrier and in behavioral disorders. Thus, the gut microbiota seems to be a previously unidentified target in the management of alcohol dependence.

However, these factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function.

This barrier is absent in mammalian cells, which makes it possible to deliver biomolecules across the lipid bilayer of mammalian cells using DNA nanostructures. Herein, we report a systematic assessment of different DNA nanostructures for their ability to internalize into cells of mature plants, deliver siRNAs, and effectively silence a constitutively expressed gene in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. We show that nanostructure internalization into plant cells and corresponding gene silencing efficiency depends on the nanostructure size, shape, compactness, stiffness, and location of the siRNA attachment locus on the nanostructure. We further confirm that the internalization efficiency of DNA nanostructures correlates with their respective gene silencing efficiencies but that the endogenous gene silencing pathway depends on the siRNA attachment locus. Our work establishes the feasibility of biomolecule delivery to plants with DNA nanostructures and both details the design parameters of importance for plant cell internalization and also assesses the impact of DNA nanostructure geometry for gene silencing mechanisms. This work is expected to be useful for the plant biology community and for"

We show that small tributaries can be a major source of nutrients to large water bodies, and that their nutrient loads are disproportionately high in dissolved inorganic forms. This is because small tributaries are more likely to be located in urban and agricultural areas, where nutrients are more readily available for algal growth. Our findings suggest that nutrient management efforts to reduce coastal eutrophication should focus on small tributaries."

We find that the long-time dynamics of such systems are biased toward states that exhibit a fine-tuned extremization of environmental forcing. This behavior is reminiscent of the “fine-tuning problem” in cosmology, where the rare combinations of cosmological parameters that are required to explain the observed cosmic microwave background radiation are in some sense “fine-tuned” to their current values. Our results suggest that the same might be true for the rare combinations of chemical concentrations that are required to maintain a stable, far-from-equilibrium steady state in a chemical network. This is a new perspective on the fine-tuning problem that may be relevant to the study of the origin of life."

Although NMDAR-Abs are known to disrupt receptor function, the mechanisms by which they cause paroxysmal EEG abnormalities are poorly understood. Here we show that NMDAR-Abs change the intrinsic microcircuitry of the cortex, which in turn alters the spectral composition of spontaneous EEG activity. We also show that these changes are critical for the development of paroxysmal EEG abnormalities. These findings offer mechanistic insights into the circuit-level dysfunction induced by NMDAR-Abs. They also provide a framework for understanding the effects of other autoantibodies on brain function. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The event is linked to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 and a biodiversity nadir. The warming event was linked to an increase in nutrient fluxes and thermocline stratification. These results provide insights into the potential for rapid warming events in the future. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

We show that RSPO certification is associated with reduced deforestation in oil palm plantations. However, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results suggest that certification is not yet delivering on its promise to reduce deforestation."

Dysfunction of the exocyst complex is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. However, the study of the regulation of the exocyst complex is limited by the lethality or the severity of phenotypes in the genetically tractable organisms. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 (exocyst component of 70 kDa) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and offers a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. This article is protected by copyright.

In many vertebrates, sex is determined by a single locus, resulting in two sexes. In contrast, in species with polygenic sex determination, multiple alleles are segregating within a single species, allowing for more than two genotypic sexes. Here we investigate the effects of polygenic sex determination on secondary sexual characteristics in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii. We find that polygenic sex determination in M. mbenjii produces an interplay of sex linkage and sex limitation resulting in modular variation in morphological and behavioral traits. The modularity of secondary sexual characteristics produced by polygenic sex determination provides context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations.

However, the evolution of specialization is often considered a dead end, as it is difficult to evolve morphological and functional optimizations throughout the organism. Here we show that siphonophores, a group of pelagic cnidarians, have evolved a modular prey-capture system, with specialized structures for each prey type. Our results suggest that the evolution of specialization is not a dead end, and that specialization can be a stepping stone to morphological diversification. These findings contribute to understanding how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs."

This finding provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key shared derived characteristic of modern human and Neandertal hand morphology. This finding also suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato.

However, one-carbon donor formate is required for cellular SHMT2 activity, and thus the inhibitor is unexpectedly cytotoxic in a cancer cell-line screen. We show that formate is a potent glycine import inhibitor, and that formate import is defective in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), a cancer cell-line screen that is uniquely sensitive to SHMT inhibition. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of DLBCL. This study provides a foundation for the development of SHMT inhibitors as a cancer therapeutic.
