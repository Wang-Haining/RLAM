This finding is of great importance to the understanding of the structure of ice II under high pressure and low temperature conditions. It also provides a new route to study the structure of ice II under high pressure and low temperature conditions.

In this paper, we provide a purely categorical approach to the foundations of quantum theory. Our approach is based on the observation that the category of Hilbert spaces and bounded linear operators is equivalent to the category of continuous linear functions between the categories of probability spaces and Borel measures. This result is a generalization of the celebrated Gelfand–Naimark theorem, which is a special case of our result. Our approach provides a framework for the reconstruction of quantum theory from a categorical point of view."

Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we report the results of a genomic and transcriptomic analysis of two distantly related myxozoan species and a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results show that myxozoans are cnidarians and are a sister taxon to P. hydriforme. In addition, we show that myxozoans are one of the most reduced animal groups, with one of the smallest genomes and gene sets. These results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian"

The disease is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is able to evade the host immune response by blocking IFN-mediated antiviral signaling. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes. Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a potential"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels."

We use a global dataset of maize production and climate variability to quantify how yield variability will change in the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. We find that as the global mean temperature increases, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields increases almost everywhere to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields. For the top four maize-exporting countries, which account for 87% of global maize exports, the probability that they have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is largely unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa in the complex mixtures of plant material consumed. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammal species in semiarid African savanna. We found that, despite being similar in body size and digestive physiology, species differed in their proportional grass consumption, suggesting that species may partition food resources in ways that are not easily predicted from their trophic guild. Our results suggest that the extent of food-resource partitioning may be greater than previously thought, and that the diversity of large mammalian herbivores may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized."

However, the magnitude and the fate of this pollution are still open questions. We show that the global load of plastic on the open ocean surface is far less than expected, mostly due to size-selective sinks. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

We determined the ages of 40 large presolar silicon carbide grains extracted from the Murchison CM2 meteorite.

The most widely used drugs for treating hypertension are the L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs), which are effective in lowering blood pressure. However, the use of LCCBs is associated with the development of heart failure. Here, we show that LCCBs activate Ca2+ signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells, which is mediated by the N terminus of STIM proteins. Our findings may help to explain the association of LCCBs with heart failure and may lead to the development of new strategies for the treatment of hypertension. (PsycINFO Database Record"

To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters, and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data."

Phylogenomic analyses of these uniquely comprehensive datasets resolved previously controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, plant cell wall-degrading enzymes obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, both major independent origins of specialized herbivory in beetles coincide with the first appearances of these genes in the fossil record. These findings suggest that these novel genes enabled efficient digestion of plant tissues, including lignocellulose in cell walls, facilitating the evolution of uniquely specialized plant-feeding habits, such as leaf mining and stem and wood boring."

These data put APOE central to AD pathophysiology, but it is not yet clear how APOE alleles modify AD risk. Here, we report a novel role for APOE in controlling the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes.

It is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell migration, cell division, and cell differentiation. However, the mechanism by which ADF regulates actin dynamics is not fully understood. Here, we show that the mechanical torque exerted by the actin filament network on ADF is critical for ADF’s ability to sever actin filaments. We propose that this mechanism is critical for ADF’s function in cells. Our work provides a mechanism for how mechanical forces can regulate the activity of proteins involved in the regulation of actin dynamics. This work also provides a framework for understanding the role of mechanical forces in regulating the activity of other proteins."

However, it is difficult to be well represented in current climate models. This is due to the complexity of the interaction process and the lack of observational capability. Here, we introduce a new instrument, the dual-field-of-view high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL), which can provide simultaneous observations of aerosols and clouds. This instrument is capable of providing high-resolution and simultaneous observations of aerosols and clouds, especially water cloud microphysical properties. We use this instrument to investigate the interactions between aerosol loading and water cloud microphysical properties. The observations show that the increased aerosol loading led to increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius, which is consistent with expectations. However, the increased aerosol loading had no discernible increase on liquid water path. This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI."

This paper presents a method for determining the temperature of the Earth’s surface in the past. The method is based on the thermostability of reconstructed ancestral enzymes. The results of this study suggest that the temperature of the Earth’s surface decreased over geological time. This finding is consistent with previous temperature estimates based on isotopic evidence.

The K+ channel BK channel is a major regulator of the resting membrane potential of the heart and is also involved in the regulation of blood pressure. The BK channel is unique in that it lacks a classic activation gate and shows no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. This study may provide a new perspective for the study of K+ channel regulation. (Read more)"

In temperate regions, seasonal outbreaks of influenza virus correlate with decreases in ambient humidity. While low humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes them more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings have important implications for understanding the impact of climate change on the spread of influenza virus and the development of effective therapeutic strategies.

This pattern of activity is consistent with a merge operation that applies equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity. More superficial models of language, based on sequential transition probabilities, only captured activity in the posterior middle temporal gyrus. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases."

We find that the orb web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to capture the sound-induced air particle movements that approach the maximum physical efficiency better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself. The spider also enables the flexibility to functionally adjust and regularly regenerate its external ""eardrum"" according to its needs. The outsourcing and supersizing"

They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions.

The source of the parchment, often called “uterine vellum,” has been a long-standing controversy in codicology. This study reports the results of a simple and objective method for identifying the animal origin of parchment.

Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals, but did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides.

However, the mechanisms by which this is achieved are poorly understood. Here, we show that the squid Euprymna scolopes regulates the activities of its symbiotic luminescent bacteria through the strategic delivery of a single glycan, chitin. This glycan is provided by the host only at dusk, when the squid is preparing to produce light. We also show that the glycan is required for the persistence of the symbionts, and that it is catabolized by the symbionts themselves, which is necessary for the acidification of the host tissue, which in turn enhances the activity of the symbionts. Our results suggest that the provision of nutrients to symbionts may be a more general mechanism for the maintenance of the health of animal tissues. This article is protected by copyright.

Our results provide a detailed quantitative picture of reporting about lethal violence and its gendered nature. Our method offers a flexible and broadly applicable approach to model topics in text data. It can be applied to many domains and is likely to be useful in many applications.

There is an urgent need for novel and more efficient therapies, ideally targeting AML stem cells that are essential for maintaining the disease. In this study, we show that monoclonal antibodies targeting the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The RNA encodes a 28-amino acid protein that increases dehydrogenase activity and represses genes involved in glycerol metabolism. The protein interacts with the membrane-associated glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of galactose metabolism. The RNA also encodes a protein that interferes with the RNA’s own repression. These results demonstrate that the translation and base-pairing functions compete. This is the first example of a dual-function RNA in which the protein and RNA functions compete. This work provides insight into the evolution of dual-function RNAs and the mechanisms by which they compete. It also provides a mechanism for the regulation of glycerol metabolism in bacteria. This work may also be relevant to the regulation of other metabolic pathways. (Read more)"

These proteins form characteristic intracellular inclusion bodies that are present in all forms of ALS. Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions in the brain and spinal cord are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. Rather, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. Our results provide a new perspective on the pathogenesis of ALS and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies. (PsycINFO Database Record"

Devices can be fabricated reliably from a 200-nm silicon nitride device layer using a lithography-based process, producing predicted optical properties in transmission and reflection measurements.

Our results indicate that the interaction we identified is a molecular mechanism that might be used by influenza A viruses to package their genome. The lack of conservation of this interaction among influenza A viruses might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses. This interaction might also be used by other RNA viruses. (Read more)"

Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of the role of the disturbed flow in the development of atherosclerotic lesions and suggest that inhibition of YAP/TAZ activation is a promising therapeutic strategy for the prevention of atherosclerosis.

We argue that this has important implications for policy and management, and that actions to reduce fire risk should focus on regions where human-caused wildfires are most prevalent."

We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits.
