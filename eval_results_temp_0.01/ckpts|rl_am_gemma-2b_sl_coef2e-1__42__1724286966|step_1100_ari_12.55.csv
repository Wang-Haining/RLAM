The guest molecules are enclathrated in the host lattices, and the guest molecules are free to move in the host lattices. This work provides a new example of a “guest-host” complex, and it also provides a new perspective on the structure of hydrate.

This addresses a question about the foundations of quantum theory raised in reconstruction programs such as those of von Neumann, Mackey, Jauch, Piron, Abramsky, and Coecke. Our results provide a starting point for a theory of quantum computation and communication based on a categorical foundation.

Here, we present the first comparative analysis of the genomes of two distantly related species of Myxozoa and a cnidarian parasite. Our results show that the Myxozoa are a sister group to the Cnidaria and that the Myxozoan body plan is the result of a dramatic reduction in genome size and gene content.

The causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is able to evade the antiviral action of the immune system by blocking the nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are essential for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 uses a viral accessory protein, Orf6, to block nuclear import of the cargo-receptor complex. We demonstrate that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1, a protein involved in the docking of the cargo-receptor complex. We also show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its ability to antagonize the antiviral action of IFN. Our findings unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This mechanism may be exploited by other pathogenic viruses to evade the antiviral action of IFN. This article"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. Sperm cells are quiescent in the male reproductive system due to Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1 channels, but become active once introduced into the low-Zn2+-concentration environment of the female reproductive tract. How Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide"

We use global datasets of maize production and climate variability to quantify how maize yields will change in the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. We find that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields will increase almost everywhere to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields. The probability that the top four maize-exporting countries have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammal species (six wild, one domestic) in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammal assemblages.

However, the total amount of plastic debris on the open ocean surface is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This discrepancy is explained by the size distribution of the debris, which is dominated by small particles, mostly below 1 mm. These particles are rapidly degraded into smaller particles, which are then transported to the ocean interior. This sink may be responsible for the missing plastic debris. This study provides a better understanding of the fate of the plastic debris in the ocean. It also provides a reference for the future monitoring of the problem. This is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

The global fleet could increase by 1 million more motorized vessels by midcentury as developing countries continue to transition away from subsistence fisheries. This would challenge sustainable use of fisheries' resources. The expansion of the motorized fleet has been driven by the powered-artisanal fleet, which has grown substantially in recent decades.

They are involved in a wide variety of physiological processes and are the target of many drugs. The selectivity filter is the narrowest part of the channel and is responsible for the channel’s selectivity. It is also the most structurally conserved part of the channel. We have identified a second Threonine residue within the signature sequence of potassium channels as a crucial residue for the functional and structural coupling between the activation gate and the selectivity filter. We have shown that this residue is responsible for the allosteric communication between the two gates. We have also shown that the collapse of the selectivity filter can be used to achieve closed-state inactivation.

It is regulated by cellular metabolism, redox homeostasis, and various signaling pathways related to cancer. In this study, we found that activating mutation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) function, highly frequent events in human cancer, confers ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells, and that inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis induction. Mechanistically, this resistance requires sustained activation of mTORC1 and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)C1-dependent induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. Furthermore, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a transcriptional target of SREBP1, mediates the ferroptosis-suppressing activity of SREBP1 by producing monounsaturated fatty acids.

Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. This study provides a mechanistic explanation for the association of LCCBs with heart failure and may lead to the development of new strategies for the treatment of heart failure.

We show that the best candidate is more active than telithromycin, a clinically used acylide antibiotic, and is up to 56 times more active against resistant pathogens than telithromycin. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

The record shows a dramatic shift in the hydroclimate of the region at the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, which is consistent with the global climate record. The record also shows that the evolution of the lake was controlled by a combination of climate and tectonic forcing. The evolution of the lake was also influenced by the evolution of the cichlid fish species flock, which is one of the most successful evolutionary events in the history of life on Earth.

We found that plant cell wall-degrading enzymes obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, these novel genes triggered adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding plant-digesting enzymes. Our results suggest that beetle diversity resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding plant-digesting enzymes.

In addition, the vaccine is temperature sensitive, which is an important safety feature. In vivo studies in hamsters showed that the vaccine is protective at a single intranasal dose. The vaccine is also highly immunogenic, with high levels of neutralizing antibodies. Taken together, these data support the potential of the vaccine for use in mass vaccination programs.

It is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis and can be transmitted by multiple transmission pathways. Today, most human plague cases are bubonic, caused by spillover of infected fleas from rodent epizootics, or pneumonic, caused by inhalation of infectious droplets. However, little is known about the historical spread of plague in Europe during the Second Pandemic (14–19th centuries), including the Black Death, which led to high mortality and recurrent epidemics for hundreds of years. Here, we describe a compartmental model for plague transmission by a human ectoparasite vector. Using Bayesian inference, we found that this model fits mortality curves from nine outbreaks in Europe better than models for pneumonic or rodent transmission. Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346–1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats.

However, its function in mitochondria of normal and transformed cells is more complex than previously appreciated. We have shown that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. Thus, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria may be more complex than previously thought. This may have implications for the design of TRAP1-targeted therapies. Our findings also suggest that TRAP1 may be a promising target for the treatment of cancer metastasis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

They are also the major targets of the actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin family of proteins. ADF/cofilin is the major regulator of actin filament disassembly. However, how it does so remains unclear. Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to study the action of ADF/cofilin in different mechanical situations. We find that ADF/cofilin binds more efficiently to filaments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist. We propose that this ADF/cofilin-induced twist enhances severing by increasing the severing rate constant 100-fold. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the function of ADF/cofilin in cells. They also provide a general framework for understanding the action of other proteins that bind to filaments in a twist-dependent manner.

We demonstrate that RppH decaps Np4-capped RNAs by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to decapsulate other RNAs. This enzyme recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends by a mechanism that is unique to it, resulting in a one-nucleotide shift in substrate specificity. The unconventional manner in which RppH recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress.

Finally, we highlight that the mass of humans is an order of magnitude higher than that of all wild mammals combined and report the historical impact of humanity on the global biomass of prominent taxa, including mammals, fish, and plants. Our results provide a global view of the biomass of the biosphere and its distribution among the kingdoms of life. They are a key input"

The fast-on, slow-off state is important for VWF binding to platelets. This mechanism explains the pathophysiology of VWD. The force-induced conformational changes are consistent with the observed effects of VWD mutations on VWF binding to platelets. The force-induced changes in VWF conformation are also consistent with the effects of VWF mutations on the binding of other proteins to VWF.

This instrument, verified by the Monte Carlo simulation and coincident observations of other techniques, was used to investigate the interactions between aerosol loading and water cloud microphysical properties. A case study over Beijing highlights the scientific potential of the dual-FOV HSRL to become a significant contributor to the ACI investigations.

They regulate ion flow by opening and closing their pore gates. K+ channels commonly possess two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We induced C-type inactivation in BK channels and studied the relationship between activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery. We observed prominent slow C-type inactivation/recovery in BK channels by an extreme low concentration of extracellular K+ together with a Y294E/K/Q/S or Y279F mutation whose equivalent in Shaker channels (T449E/K/D/Q/S or W434F) caused a greatly accelerated rate of C-type inactivation or constitutive C-inactivation.

We found that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

This pattern of activity was consistent with a merge operation, which applies equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity. More superficial models of language, based on sequential transition probabilities, only captured activity in the posterior middle temporal gyrus.

It is the most frequent cause of cancer death in children. The majority of neuroblastomas have a poor prognosis. The molecular mechanisms underlying the development of neuroblastoma are not fully understood. Here, we show that the zebrafish ALK homologue DrLtk is activated by the zebrafish ALK homologues DrALKals. We further show that the loss of DrALKals causes a complete loss of iridophores, pigment cells of the zebrafish. Our results provide in vivo evidence of the involvement of ALK/ALKals in the development of neural crest-derived tissues. This study provides a better understanding of the role of ALK/ALKals in the development of neural crest-derived tissues and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for neuroblastoma.

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, HM predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. HM was associated with less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia, but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors. The findings highlight the importance of psychological examinations of masculinity as a cultural ideology to understand how men’s and women’s endorsement of HM legitimizes patriarchal dominance and reinforces gender, race, and class-based hierarchies via candidate support. The findings have implications for understanding the 2016 and 2020 American presidential elections and beyond. (PsycINFO Database Record"

We used expert opinion and scientific evidence to identify host, viral, and environmental risk factors contributing to zoonotic virus spillover and spread in humans.

We validated the risk assessment using data from virus discovery projects and public records of virus detections around the world. We hope that SpillOver will be used by policy makers and health scientists to inform research and public health interventions for prevention and rapid control of disease outbreaks.

Our results indicate that the genetic ancestry of the individuals is mostly of northern and central European origin, but that women exhibit a very high genetic heterogeneity. This heterogeneity includes signals of genetic ancestry ranging from western Europe to East Asia. In addition, we found that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago.

To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions. Our findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and the origins of bat coronaviruses. They also provide a basis for the development of vaccines and therapeutics against MERS-CoV.

In humans, pol δ is responsible for replicating the lagging strand template during DNA replication. The stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. Most of our understanding comes from Saccharomyces cerevisae where the extreme stability of the pol δ holoenzyme ensures that every nucleobase within an Okazaki fragment is faithfully duplicated before dissociation. However, the human pol δ holoenzyme is unstable and dissociates rapidly. This study reveals that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This study also reveals that the human pol δ holoenzyme is more similar to the replication proofreading form of pol δ than to the replicative form.

We show that many frogs and toads have blue-green tissues due to unusually high concentrations of biliverdin, a molecule that is normally found in the blood. We also show that biliverdin is a substrate of a group of serpins, which are protease inhibitors. These serpins bind biliverdin and are responsible for the color change in frogs and toads. Our results provide a mechanism for the evolution of color change in vertebrates and a new function for a member of the serpin superfamily. This study also shows that the evolution of color is not a rare event in evolution. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

However, the mechanisms by which hypoxia promotes cancer progression are not fully understood. Here we show that hypoxia induces expression of AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), which demethylates N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications on messenger RNA (mRNA). ALKBH5 expression is induced by hypoxia through the hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1α and HIF-2α. ALKBH5 expression is required for the induction of breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) characteristics by hypoxia. ALKBH5 overexpression increases the percentage of BCSCs, and knockdown of ALKBH5 expression decreases the percentage of BCSCs. Thus, ALKBH5 is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of breast cancer. Our findings provide insight into the role of ALKBH5 in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment.

The first pocket Bibles were made in the 13th century. The source of this parchment, often called “uterine vellum,” has been a long-standing controversy in codicology. Here, we report a simple and objective method to identify the animal origin of parchment. The noninvasive method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals; however, we did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides. These results suggest that ultrafine vellum does not necessarily derive from the use of abortive or newborn animals with ultrathin hides, but could equally well reflect a production process that allowed the skins of maturing animals of several species to be rendered into vellum of equal quality and fin"

The carbon cycle reorganization precedes the extinction and is punctuated by a sharp (3‰), short-lived negative spike in the isotopic composition of carbonate carbon. The carbon cycle volatility persists for ∼500 ka before a return to near preextinction values. This new age model will allow a refined evaluation of the relative roles of rate-dependent processes contributing to the extinction, allowing insight into postextinction ecosystem expansion.

RORαΔIEC mice exhibit excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis reveals corecruitment of RORα and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) on NF-κB target promoters and subsequent dismissal of CREB binding protein (CBP) and bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) for transcriptional repression. Together, we demonstrate that RORα/HDAC3-mediated attenuation of NF-κB signaling controls the balance of inflammatory responses, and therapeutic strategies targeting this epigenetic regulation could be beneficial"

Chitin is released by the host only at night, when the symbiont population is at its highest, and is required for the periodic acidification of the crypts, which increases the availability of oxygen to the symbionts. This glycan is thus used as a cue to synchronize the activities of the host and symbiont. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of how the host and symbiont are regulated in a mutualism, and may have implications for other symbioses. (Show more)"

Moreover, our data provide evidence that soil respiration may decrease with increasing temperature in most biomes, a response that is not captured by most single-site studies. This decrease in temperature sensitivity at higher temperatures may result in regionally variable responses in soil respiration, with colder climates being considerably more responsive to increased ambient temperatures compared with warmer regions. Our results highlight the importance of cross-biome analysis in improving our mechanistic understanding of how soil carbon dynamics change with climatic warming.

The transition from autotrophy to a nonphotosynthetic parasitic lifestyle is a major evolutionary event in the history of life. Here, we present a model of the trajectory of plastid genome evolution during the transition from autotrophy to a parasitic lifestyle. We show that the loss of photosynthesis is linked to the establishment of a parasitic lifestyle, characterized by the parasite’s dependence on a host to fulfill its life cycle. Our findings suggest that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner. During the functional reduction process, the elevation of evolutionary rates reaches several new rate equilibria, possibly relating to the modified protein turnover rates in heterotrophic plastids. This evolutionary trajectory is a powerful tool to study the evolution of the plastid genome and its functional components. This model can be used to study the evolution of the plastid genome in other lineages. This model can also be used to study the evolution of the plastid genome in other lineages.

The contribution of anthropogenic climate change to this prolonged rainfall deficit has been estimated through observations and climate models. However, model adequacy and insufficient horizontal resolution make it difficult to precisely quantify the changing likelihood of extreme droughts, given the small regional scale. Here, we use a high-resolution large ensemble to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the probability of occurrence of multiyear SSA rainfall deficits in past and future decades. We find that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% by the year 2100 under an intermediate-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5 [SSP2-4.5]) and to 80% under a high-emission scenario (SSP5-8.5). These results highlight the strong sensitivity of the drought risk in SSA to future anthropogenic emissions. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Plant and cyanobacterial mutants in ycf54 display impaired function of the diiron enzyme, accumulating the reaction substrate. Swapping cyclases between cyanobacteria and purple phototrophic bacteria reveals three classes of the diiron enzyme. A diiron enzyme from a betaproteobacterium is required for cyanobacterial function, whereas alphaproteobacterial cyclases require a protein encoded by a gene conserved in these organisms.

ASK1 deficiency in T cells and dendritic cells had no significant effects on EAE severity. Activated astrocytes produce key inflammatory mediators, including CCL2, which further activated and recruited microglia/macrophages.

The drought began in 2012 and has led to acute water shortages, groundwater overdraft, critically low streamflow, and enhanced wildfire risk. We find that the probability of drought has increased in the past two decades, and that this increase is attributable to human activities. We also find that the probability of drought has increased when precipitation deficits are combined with warm conditions. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of co-occurring warm–dry conditions like those that have created the acute human and ecosystem impacts associated with the “exceptional” 2012–2014 drought in California. Thus, the human-caused warming of the climate system is increasing the probability of drought.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. Our findings provide a mechanistic understanding of the autism-risk genes and their functions and may facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies. This study also provides a useful model system for the study of the underlying mechanisms of behavioral flexibility. (Show more)"

However, the mechanisms by which this is achieved are poorly understood. Here, we show that the squid Euprymna scolopes regulates the activities of its luminescent symbionts, Vibrio fischeri, by the strategic provision of a single glycan, chitin. Chitin is released by the host only at night, when the symbiont population is at its highest, and is required for the periodic acidification of the crypts, which increases the availability of oxygen to the symbionts. This glycan is thus used as a cue to synchronize the activities of the host and symbiont. This work provides a mechanistic understanding of how host-derived nutrients are used to regulate the activities of symbiotic microbes. It also suggests that other hosts may use similar strategies to regulate the activities of their associated microbes. (Show more)"

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis remain unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We found that the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion. For the N3-EtdT lesion that disrupts base pairing, multiple transcriptional lesion bypass routes were found. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop). The Pro-Gate loop faces toward the minor groove of RNA:DNA hybrid and is involved in modulating the translocation of minor-groove alkylated DNA"

Chemotherapy is the most common treatment for breast cancer, but resistance to chemotherapy is a major problem. In this study, we found that the expression of the type I tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor ROR1 increased in breast cancer cells following treatment with chemotherapy. We also found that ROR1 enhanced the capacity of breast cancer cells to metastasize and reengraft Rag2−/−γc−/− mice. Finally, we found that treatment of mice bearing breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) with the humanized anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab repressed expression of genes associated with breast cancer stemness, reduced activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or BMI1, and impaired the capacity of breast cancer PDXs to metastasize or reengraft Rag2−/−γc−/− mice. These results indicate that targeting ROR1 may improve the response to chemotherapy of patients with breast cancer. Thus, cirmtuzumab may be a promising agent for the treatment of breast cancer.

In the adult mammalian CNS, however, the ability to regenerate is lost, and the adult nervous system is unable to repair itself after injury. Here, we identify a form of regeneration in the adult nervous system that is independent of the canonical MAPK signaling pathway. This form of regeneration is triggered by physical lesion of the neuron’s sensory dendrite, and it is enhanced by disrupting calcium signaling. These findings suggest that this form of regeneration is a powerful platform for the discovery of new mechanisms controlling the adult nervous system’s intrinsic regenerative capacity. Moreover, they suggest that the adult nervous system may be more plastic than previously thought. This study unites disparate forms of regeneration to uncover fresh molecular insights into activity-dependent control of the adult nervous system’s intrinsic regenerative capacity.

The analysis of these fluctuations has led to the identification of a number of networks, which are topographically and functionally distinct. Here, we used metabolic PET to identify and validate the dominant resting state network in healthy and disease populations. We found that the dominant resting state network was topographically similar to the default mode network in healthy subjects. In contrast, in Parkinson’s disease, this dominant resting state network was subordinated to an independent disease-related pattern. Network functionality was assessed by quantifying metabolic RSN expression in cerebral blood flow PET scans acquired at rest and during task performance. We found that the dominant resting state network was deactivated during rest and activated during task performance. This abnormality was reduced in advanced Parkinson’s disease, and time-course comparisons of dominant resting state network loss in longitudinal resting metabolic scans from Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease subjects illustrated that significant reductions appeared later for Parkinson’s disease, in parallel with the development of cognitive dysfunction.

The role of the fibrous sheath interacting protein 1 (FSIP1) in TNBC has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 is highly expressed in TNBC and is associated with poor prognosis. FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. This article is protected by copyright.

However, these factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function.

Here, we describe a previously unrecognized, highly unusual form of arborization of striatonigral fibers, which are the major source of dopamine to the striatum. These striosome–dendron bouquets are formed by striatonigral fibers that originate in striosomes and target clusters of dopamine-containing dendrites and their parent cell bodies in the ventral tegmental area. These clustered cell bodies in turn project to the striatum as part of the classic nigrostriatal pathway. Thus, the striosome–dendron bouquets likely represent subsystems with the nigro–striato–nigral loop that are affected in human disorders including Parkinson’s disease. Given evidence that striosomes receive input from cortical regions related to the control of mood and motivation and that they link functionally to reinforcement and decision-making, the striosome–dendron bouquets could be critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease.

Instead, it is based on the reduction of firing rates and the storage of information in the dynamics of the adaptive conductances that control the levels of inhibition. This work provides a step toward a computational neurobiology of language. It also provides a mechanism for the temporal integration of linguistic information."

Thus, they have evolved a number of defense mechanisms to protect themselves from pathogens. One such mechanism is the production of siRNAs, which are then used to trigger the immune response. Herein, we report the delivery of siRNAs to plants using DNA nanostructures. We show that the size, shape, and location of the siRNA attachment locus on the DNA nanostructure are important for the delivery and gene silencing efficiency. Our work establishes the feasibility of delivering biomolecules to plants and also details the design parameters of importance for plant cell internalization and also assesses the impact of DNA nanostructure geometry for gene silencing mechanisms. This work will be useful for the development of new strategies for the delivery of biomolecules to plants. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

We show that small tributaries can be a significant source of nutrients to coastal areas, especially in large water bodies. We found that the 6 largest tributaries of Lake Michigan accounted for 70% of the daily nutrient loads delivered to the lake. However, small tributaries exhibited nutrient loads that were high for their size and biased toward dissolved inorganic forms. This suggests that their plumes become trapped and then overlap in the nearshore zone, increasing the likelihood of coastal eutrophication. Our findings highlight the importance of small tributaries in coastal nutrient cycling and provide a framework for future efforts to reduce the ecological impacts of nutrient loading on valuable nearshore ecosystems.

We show that the immune response can change the dynamics of the brain, making it more susceptible to paroxysmal EEG abnormalities. This is likely to be a common mechanism in autoimmune encephalitis, and may explain why the same antibodies can cause different syndromes. This mechanism may also explain the effects of other immune responses, such as those caused by viral encephalitis. This work offers mechanistic insights into the mechanisms of immune-mediated seizures. It may also lead to the development of new therapies. (Show more)"

To understand the causes and consequences of such events, it is important to understand the history of abrupt warming in the past. Here, we present a case study of an abrupt warming event that occurred during a glacial period.

We show that RSPO certification reduced tropical forest loss in Indonesia by 33%. However, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results suggest that certification is not a silver bullet for tropical deforestation, but it is an important tool in the toolbox of policies to reduce tropical deforestation. Our findings also highlight the importance of certification in forested regions, where most remaining forests are located.

In humans, its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. The exocyst complex is composed of 10 subunits, and the function of the complex is conserved across species. In this study, we discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and offers a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

In vertebrates, sex is determined by a single locus, resulting in two sexes. In species with multiple sex determination alleles, however, sex determination is polygenic, and the sex of an individual can be determined by more than one sex determination allele. Here we investigate the effects of polygenic sex determination in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii, where two sex determination alleles produce four possible sexes. We find that polygenic sex determination results in modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics, and that the introgression of a newly acquired sex determination allele creates additional axes of variation for secondary sexual characteristics. These results provide context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations. (Show more)"

However, the evolution of specialization is often considered a dead end, as morphological and functional optimizations are often lost during the evolution of more generalized predators.

We show that siphonophore specialists can evolve into generalists, and that specialists on one prey type have evolved into specialists on other prey types. Our findings help to understand how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs. They also provide a new perspective on the evolution of predator specialization."

This fossil provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key derived feature of the human hand, the third metacarpal styloid process. This finding suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato.
