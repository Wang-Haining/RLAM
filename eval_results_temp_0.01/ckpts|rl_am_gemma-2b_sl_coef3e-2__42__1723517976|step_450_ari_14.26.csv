However, the structure of hydrate formed by a gas with a small atomic radius, such as neon, has not been reported. Here, we report the structure of neon hydrate at high pressure and temperature. The structure of neon hydrate is different from that of conventional hydrate, which is formed by a gas with a large atomic radius. The structure of neon hydrate is also different from that of ice II, which is formed by a small atomic radius gas. Our results provide insights into the structure of hydrate formed by a gas with a small atomic radius.

The Copenhagen interpretation, which has been widely accepted, is based on a set of axioms that are not fully satisfactory. In this paper, we provide a set of axioms for quantum mechanics that are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. This addresses a question about the foundations of quantum mechanics raised in reconstruction programs such as those of von Neumann, Mackey, Jauch, Piron, Abramsky, and Coecke. Our axioms are based on the notion of a category of observables, which is a purely categorical generalization of the notion of a vector space. Our results provide a categorical foundation for quantum mechanics that is independent of any analytical structure. They also provide a categorical framework for the study of quantum information theory."

Although the evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we present the first genomic and transcriptomic analyses of two distantly related species of myxozoans, which show that the transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. Our results provide insights into the molecular basis for the evolution of the Myxozoa. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that the SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein Orf6 is able to block nuclear import of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and thereby impair the induction of antiviral genes. We found that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 to impair docking of the karyopherin/importin complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its ability to antagonize the action of IFN. Our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the host immune system and suggests potential therapeutic targets to combat the ongoing pandemic. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

However, the extent to which species differ in their diets is largely unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa from plant material. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species of large herbivores in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between species, even when they were matched in body size and digestive physiology. Moreover, species that were similar in diet composition were often dissimilar in their proportional grass consumption, indicating that diet composition is a more important determinant of coexistence than proportional grass consumption. These findings suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages. Our results also highlight the importance of plant diversity in structuring LMH assemblages. This is an important step toward understanding the role of LMH in the conservation of African savanna biodiversity."

However, the global load of floating plastic debris is still unknown. We show that the plastic debris load in the open ocean is far less than expected, mostly because of size-selective sinks. These sinks are likely to be related to the rapid fragmentation of plastic debris into smaller and smaller pieces, which are then transported to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes. This study is of fundamental importance to understand the fate of the missing plastic debris in the ocean. It also provides a new perspective on the role of size-selective sinks in the fate of particles in the environment. This study may also help to improve the design of future experiments and models."

We determined ages of 40 large presolar silicon carbide grains extracted from the Murchison CM2 meteorite. The grains have ages of 3.9 ± 1.6 Ma to ∼3 ± 2 Ga, which is consistent with the age of the Solar System. However, a minority of the grains have ages of &gt;1 Ga, which is much older than the Solar System. We estimate that the grains acquired the bulk of their cosmogenic nuclides in the interstellar medium and not by exposure to an enhanced particle flux of the early active sun.

We show that the ability to provide energy to the mother, either through domestication or allonursing, can increase reproductive output. This increase is not due to an increase in resource availability, but rather an increase in metabolic power. This suggests that the limiting factor on reproductive output in placental mammals is metabolic power rather than resource availability."

Our findings provide a structural basis for the functional coupling between the activation gate and the selectivity filter in potassium channels.

We show that IGF2BP1 is expressed in the fetal liver and is silenced in the adult bone marrow. In erythroid cells, IGF2BP1 causes a nearly complete reversal of the adult hemoglobin expression pattern toward a more fetal-like pattern. This reversal is mediated by reduced expression of the transcription factor BCL11A.

We also found that SREBP1-mediated lipogenesis is required for cancer cells to survive ferroptosis. These findings suggest that targeting the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in combination with ferroptosis induction may be a promising strategy for cancer therapy. This strategy could be applied to a wide range of cancers, including those with mutations in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, such as breast and prostate cancer. These findings also suggest that ferroptosis may be a useful therapeutic target in cancer. (Show more)"

These drugs are effective in lowering blood pressure, but their long-term use is associated with adverse effects. Here, we show that LCCBs activate the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ sensor STIM1 and the plasma membrane ORAI1 channels, which promote vascular remodeling. Our data indicate that LCCBs are more associated with heart failure than other antihypertensive drugs in patients. Our findings unravel a mechanism of LCCBs action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. These findings may help to improve the safety of LCCBs in patients. (Show more)"

The development of new antibiotics is a long and expensive process, which is why it is necessary to identify promising candidates as early as possible. In this study, we present a computational approach to identify promising acylide antibiotics that can be used to combat antibiotic resistance. We show that our approach is successful in identifying promising candidates that are active against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. The best candidate identified by us is synthetically more accessible, exhibits higher binding affinity to the ribosome, and is up to 56 times more active against resistant pathogens than telithromycin. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

The record provides insights into the influence of orbital forcing on the evolution of the Lake Malawi endemic cichlid fish species flock.

These novel genes triggered adaptive radiations that resulted in nearly half of all living beetle species. We propose that beetle diversity resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding enzymes that enable digestion of plant cell walls.

However, the evolution of brain information-processing capacity, which is the ultimate goal of evolution, has been largely ignored. This study shows that the evolution of brain information-processing capacity is not only different from that of brain size but also has a complex pattern. The evolution of brain information-processing capacity is characterized by four major shifts in the number of neurons, which are associated with the evolution of birds and primates. These results have important implications for studies using relative brain size as a proxy when looking for evolutionary drivers of animal cognition."

Some studies have shown that TRAP1 is a tumor suppressor, whereas others have shown that it is an oncogene. Here we show that TRAP1 is a metabolic regulator that promotes a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 may act as a tumor suppressor in some settings. These data provide a mechanistic basis for the observed correlation between TRAP1 expression and tumor grade in several cancers. The TRAP1-Src interaction provides a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment. (Show more)"

Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to study the action of ADF/cofilin in different mechanical situations. We find that ADF/cofilin binds to and severes actin filaments more efficiently when the filaments are under mechanical stress. We propose that this mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. Our findings have implications for understanding how ADF/cofilin severing is regulated in cells. They also provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of mechanical stress in severing.

However, the predominant Np4 decapping enzyme in bacteria, ApaH, is inactivated by the very conditions of disulfide stress that enable Np4-capped RNAs to accumulate to high levels. Here, we show that, in cells experiencing such stress, the pyrophosphohydrolase RppH assumes a leading role in decapping those transcripts, preferring them as substrates over their triphosphorylated and diphosphorylated counterparts. The unique manner in which capped substrates of this kind bind to the active site of RppH positions the δ-phosphate, rather than the β-phosphate, for hydrolytic attack, generating triphosphorylated RNA as the primary product of decapping. This study reveals a mechanism for how a bacterial enzyme can recognize and deprotect capped RNA termini in a manner distinct from the one it uses to deprotect other 5′ termini.

We also show that female-derived proteins become enriched in the sperm proteome after mating, suggesting that female contributions support sperm viability during the prolonged period between copulation and fertilization. Our research provides a comprehensive characterization of sperm proteome dynamics and expands our understanding of the critical process of sperm–FRT interactions. This work provides a foundation for future studies that will help us understand the extent to which sperm and FRTs contribute to reproductive success. (Show more)"

The HSRL is capable of simultaneously profiling aerosol and cloud properties, especially cloud microphysical properties. We demonstrate the scientific potential of the HSRL to contribute to the ACI investigations. The observations obtained from the HSRL constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI process.

They are also the main targets of drugs and toxins. Ion channels are classified into three types based on their pore structures. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel is a type-3 channel that lacks a classic activation gate and shows no C-type inactivation. We found that BK channels have a unique slow C-type inactivation that is state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. We propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. This study provides a new perspective on the regulation of ion channels. It also provides a new target for the development of drugs and toxins that selectively target the BK channel. (Show more)

We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

The color of nectar is often used as a cue for pollinators to find the plant, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we show that the red color of the nectar of the plant Nesocodon mauritianus is derived from a previously undescribed alkaloid called nesocodin. We also identify a convergent evolution of red nectar in the hummingbird-visited Jaltomata herrerae.

We found that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion.

The pathogenesis of IBD is complex and involves multiple factors, including genetic factors, environmental factors, and the immune system. In this study, we found that retinoic acid-related orphan receptor α (RORα) is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis by attenuating nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcriptional activity. We also found that RORα/HDAC3-mediated attenuation of NF-κB signaling controls the balance of inflammatory responses. Our findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of IBD and suggest that therapeutic strategies targeting this epigenetic regulation could be beneficial to the treatment of IBD. This study also provides a potential therapeutic target for IBD. (Show more)"

This glycan is required for the maturation of the symbiotic organ, which is used for bioluminescence. Our results suggest that the provision of nutrients to the epithelium-associated microbiota may be a more general mechanism for regulating the stability of animal–microbe associations. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that other hosts may also regulate the activities of their symbiotic microbes through the strategic provision of specific nutrients.

In this study, we found that neuroinflammation was reduced in both the early and later stages of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in microglia/macrophage-specific ASK1 knockout mice, whereas only the later-stage neuroinflammation was ameliorated in astrocyte-specific ASK1 knockout mice. We also found that ASK1 signaling in microglia played a major role in generating and maintaining disease, and activated astrocytes produce key inflammatory mediators, including CCL2, that further activated and recruited microglia/macrophages. Our findings suggest that glial ASK1 is a promising therapeutic target for reducing neuroinflammation. This study also provides a mechanistic understanding of the role of ASK1 in neuroinflammation and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases.

We find that the probability of drought years has increased in recent decades, and that the probability of co-occurring warm and dry conditions has increased. We also find that anthropogenic warming has increased the probability that dry precipitation years are also warm. Thus, anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of co-occurring warm–dry conditions like those that have created the acute human and ecosystem impacts associated with the 2012–2014 drought in California. This finding has important implications for water management, ecosystem management, and climate adaptation planning in California and elsewhere.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility, which resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility in autism and may facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies. (Show more)"

However, the mechanisms underlying this spreading are poorly understood. Here we use a fluorescently tagged polyglutamine-expanded form of human huntingtin to monitor the spread of aggregates in the Drosophila brain. We show that aggregates accumulate at synaptic terminals and progressively spread throughout the brain. These aggregates are internalized and accumulate within other neurons, demonstrating that they are not cleared by the normal clearance pathways. We also show that the spread of aggregates is dependent on endocytosis in the spreading neurons, and that this can be prevented by inhibiting endocytosis. Finally, we show that the release of aggregates requires fusion protein 1, demonstrating that active release and uptake of aggregates are important elements of spreading and disease progression. These studies provide a model for the spread of protein aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases. They also provide a platform for studying the mechanisms of spreading in other neurodegenerative diseases. This work provides a proof of principle for using Drosophila as a model to study the spread of protein aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases."

Here, we identified and characterized a highly concentrated immunosuppressant protein (MTX) in the submandibular salivary gland of the bat, Myotis pilosus. MTX selectively inhibited the epoxide hydrolase function of leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) to inhibit LTB4 generation and the antiviral immune response of the host. MTX had no effect on the aminopeptidase function of LTA4H and therefore did not impair the antiinflammatory function of LTA4H. MTX potently inhibited proinflammatory proteases to induce immune tolerance and maintain high stability. This study provides deeper insight into immunologically privileged sites for microbial community residence in bats and supports the therapeutic potential of targeting MTX-LTA4H. The identification of MTX and its role in the immune system of bats may provide a new perspective for the development of therapeutic strategies to combat emerging infectious diseases. (Show more)"

Here, we show that the inclusion bodies are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. Rather, the inclusion bodies are populated by proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. Our results suggest that the inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

Here, we demonstrate that ets variant 2 (ETV2) alone can directly convert primary human adult skin fibroblasts into functional vascular ECs. In coordination with endogenous FOXC2 in fibroblasts, transduced ETV2 induces expression of multiple key endothelial development factors, including FLI1, ERG, and TAL1, and induces expression of endothelial functional molecules, including EGFL7 and von Willebrand factor. Consequently, ETVECs exhibit EC characteristics in vitro and form mature functional vasculature in Matrigel plugs transplanted in mice. Our study indicates that the creation of ETVECs provides further understanding of human EC development induced by ETV2.

Our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

In sexually reproducing organisms, recombination is essential for the formation of offspring with unique combinations of genes. In the past, recombination rates were high, but over evolutionary time, they have decreased in many regions of the genome, leaving the reasons for this change unclear. Here, we describe the distribution of recombination rates in a flowering plant, Mimulus guttatus, and show that the distribution is similar to that in yeast and in mice that lack a particular gene family of zinc finger proteins. This suggests that the patterns we describe may be ancient and conserved."

In contrast, in Parkinson’s disease, this dominant network is subordinated to a disease-related pattern. Network functionality was assessed by quantifying the expression of the dominant resting state network in healthy subjects and early Parkinson’s disease patients.

We show that the tumor suppressor protein, fibrous sheath interacting protein 1 (FSIP1), is expressed in the majority of TNBCs and is associated with poor prognosis. We also show that FSIP1 is required for the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and for the growth of tumors in mice. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. (Show more)"

This work provides a major step forward in understanding the biosynthesis of tomato flavor and will be of interest to researchers in the field of plant biochemistry. The gene identified here is a promising candidate for improvement of the flavor of tomato fruit.

However, these factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function.

This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

In many vertebrates, sex is determined by a single locus, but in others, multiple alleles interact to produce a spectrum of sex classes. Here we investigate the effects of multiple alleles on secondary sexual characteristics in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii, where two alleles interact to produce four possible sex classes. We find that multiple alleles can produce modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics, and that the evolution of a new sex determiner can create additional axes of variation for varied traits. These results provide context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of multiple alleles in the sex determination system."

These intermediates, which are known as “bisretinoids,” are toxic to photoreceptor cells. We show that the intracellular levels of iron, which are elevated in the retina, promote the photooxidation and photodegradation of bisretinoids. These findings have implications for the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in the elderly. They also suggest that the intracellular levels of iron may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of this disease. This is the first study to show that the levels of iron in the cell impact the photooxidation and photodegradation of bisretinoids. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that the evolution of siphonophore predators has been shaped by the diversification of prey types. We also show that the evolution of specialized predators is not a dead end, and that they can evolve into generalists. These findings help us understand how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs. They also provide insights into the evolution of the most extreme specialization in the animal kingdom, which is the case of siphonophores."

Here we report the discovery of a hominin hand fossil from 1.42 million years ago that preserves the third metacarpal styloid process, a key derived feature of the modern human hand. This fossil provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of this feature and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that the evolution of the modern human hand was driven by the need to adapt to a more specialized diet and a more active lifestyle. (Show more)"

We have developed a small-molecule dual inhibitor of human serine hydroxymethyltransferse (SHMT) that is highly effective in cancer cells. We have also identified a glycine import defect in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), a cancer with a unique metabolic profile. These findings provide a metabolic rationale for targeting SHMT in DLBCL, and suggest that targeting the glycine import defect may be a general strategy for treating other cancers. This work provides a metabolic basis for the differential sensitivity of B-cell and non-B cell cancers to SHMT inhibition. These findings may also have implications for other cancers that depend on SHMT enzymatic activity for survival. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that deforestation can have a negative impact on people’s diets, and that this impact can be mitigated by having access to natural landscapes such as forests. This study has important implications for policy makers, as forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals."

We show that the risk of subsoil compaction has increased over the course of modern mechanization, with the risk of compaction now exceeding safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We also show that the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, suggesting that unconstrained roaming of these giants would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles. Our results call for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. This may help to reduce the risk of subsoil compaction and improve the sustainability of modern agriculture."
