In this work, we report the synthesis and structure of neon hydrate, which is the first example of a hydrate with the ice II structure. The structure of neon hydrate is determined by in situ neutron diffraction at 480 MPa and temperatures ranging from 260 to 70 K. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The resolved structure where Ne dissolved in ice II is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. Our work provides a new route to study the structure of ice II and its stability under high pressure. This work also provides a new route to study the structure of ice II and its stability under high pressure. The results are of interest to the scientific community working on the structure of ice, high-pressure chemistry, and high-pressure materials science."

The most prominent reconstruction programs are due to von Neumann, Mackey, Jauch, Piron, Abramsky, and Coecke. They all attempt to provide a purely categorical axiomatization of quantum theory. The present paper provides a categorical characterization of Hilbert space, which is the mathematical substrate of quantum theory. The characterization is purely categorical and does not presuppose any analytical structure. The characterization is also complete in the sense that it is possible to prove that a category is equivalent to that of Hilbert spaces if and only if it satisfies the axioms. This addresses a question about the foundations of quantum theory raised in these reconstruction programs. The paper also provides a categorical characterization of the category of Hilbert spaces, which is a fundamental object in quantum theory.

The virus responsible for this pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is able to evade the antiviral action of the immune system by blocking the nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2. In this study, we show that the viral accessory protein ORF6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. Our findings provide a potential target for the development of antiviral drugs against COVID-19. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

Meeting the food demand of this growing population will become increasingly challenging as the Earth’s climate continues to warm. Earlier studies suggest that once the optimum growing temperature is exceeded, mean crop yields decline and the variability of yield increases even if interannual climate variability remains unchanged. Here, we use global datasets of maize production and climate variability combined with future temperature projections to quantify how yield variability will change in the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. We find that as the global mean temperature increases, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation (CV) of maize yields increases almost everywhere to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation (SD) of yields and a decrease in mean yields. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. They also underscore the urgency"

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammals in semiarid African savanna. We found that, despite being similar in body size and proportional grass consumption, dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Dietary composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammal assemblages, and that large mammal diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results have implications for understanding the role of large mammals in ecosystem functioning and biodiversity. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

However, the global load of plastic on the open ocean surface is still unknown. We show that the global load of plastic on the open ocean surface is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This is due to the size-selective sinks of floating plastic debris, which involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Our results point at the need for a better understanding of the fate of the missing plastic debris to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

We found that the activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis, which is highly frequent in cancer, confers ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells. This resistance is mediated, at least in part, by the induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. We also found that inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis induction.

This problem can be addressed by the development of new antibacterial agents to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. In this study, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. The results of this study provide a proof of concept for the rational design of new antibiotics. This approach can be extended to other antibiotic classes and to other pathogens. (Show more)"

We used a grid-based approach to sample the genomic diversity across the island, and we found that Madagascar is a mosaic of African and Asian ancestries. The settlement history of Madagascar is also unique. We found that Madagascar was settled by a population that was already admixed, and that the settlement happened in a sex-biased and geographically heterogeneous way. These results suggest that Madagascar is a unique case in the world, and that the history of Madagascar is not only different from other islands in the Indian Ocean, but also from the rest of Africa. This is important for understanding the history of Madagascar and the Indian Ocean. It also has implications for the study of human evolution and the peopling of the Indian Ocean. View Full-Text"

Here, we show that the RNA pyrophosphohydrolase RppH, which is known to be the predominant decapping enzyme in proteobacteria, is the primary enzyme responsible for decapping Np4-capped transcripts in Escherichia coli cells experiencing disulfide stress. This enzyme prefers Np4-capped RNAs as substrates over their triphosphorylated and diphosphorylated counterparts, and it generates monophosphorylated RNAs as the primary product of decapping. These results suggest that the unique manner in which capped substrates bind to the active site of RppH positions the δ-phosphate, rather than the β-phosphate, for hydrolytic attack, resulting in a two-step process for the deprotection of capped RNAs. This process could have major implications for the regulation of gene expression during disulfide stress. (Read more)"

This study describes the discovery of a new class of antifungal peptides from the legume Medicago truncatula. These peptides are highly diverse in sequence and exhibit potent antifungal activity against multiple plant fungal pathogens. The structure of one of the peptides, NCR044, was solved by NMR spectroscopy. The structure was largely disordered and dynamic, but the presence of a disulfide bond stabilized a short α-helix and a β-sheet. The peptide also exhibited potent fungicidal activity against plant fungal pathogens. The mode of action of the peptide was studied using microscopy and phosphoinositide binding studies.

The binding reaction is triggered, in part, by alterations in flow during bleeding.

Switching occurs near 10 pN, a force that also induces a state of the receptor−ligand complex with slower off-rate. Force greatly increases the effects of mutations in VWF, explaining pathophysiology. Conversion of single molecule kon (s−1) to bulk phase kon (s−1M−1) and the kon and koff values extrapolated to zero force for the low-force pathways show remarkably good agreement with bulk-phase measurements. This suggests that the force-dependent pathway is the dominant mechanism of VWF activation in vivo.

The temperature of the surface of the Earth has been estimated from the isotopic composition of marine cherts to have decreased from ∼65–80 °C in the Archean to the present ∼15 °C. However, this interpretation has been subject to question due to uncertainties regarding oceanic isotopic compositions, diagenetic or metamorphic resetting of the isotopic record, and depositional environments. Here, we present thermostability measurements of ancestral enzymes derived from light-requiring prokaryotic and eukaryotic phototrophs having widely separated fossil-based divergence ages. Our results suggest that Earth’s surface temperature decreased over geological time from ∼65–80 °C in the Archean, a finding consistent both with previous isotope-based and protein reconstruction-based interpretations. Interdisciplinary studies such as those reported here integrating genomic, geologic, and paleontologic data hold promise for providing new insight into the coevolution of life and environment over Earth history.

In the temperate regions, seasonal influenza virus outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in ambient humidity. While low ambient humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the impact of dry air on influenza virus infection and disease outcome. These insights may be useful for the development of strategies to mitigate the impact of influenza virus infection. This article is protected by copyright"

Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is outsourced to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. We find that the spider’s web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to detect and localize the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself. The outsourcing and supersizing of auditory function in spiders provide unique features for studying extended and regenerative sensing and designing novel acoustic flow detectors for precise fluid dynamic measurement and manipulation."

The process is complex and requires the concerted action of multiple proteins. One of the most important proteins involved in the replication of the lagging strand is DNA polymerase δ (pol δ). We have developed a series of unique kinetic assays to study the processivity and stability of pol δ holoenzyme. The results indicate that pol δ maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. Our results also suggest that the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is not as stable as previously thought. This study provides a better understanding of the role of pol δ in eukaryotic DNA replication. It also provides a foundation for the development of new therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.

We connect changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods with economic and demographic data and find that three factors predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities. Our method can be used to monitor the physical appearance of cities over time and to study the causes and consequences of urban change.

However, the mechanisms by which this occurs are not well understood. Here, we show that the provision of a single glycan to a symbiotic bacterium is sufficient to maintain its population in the host organ, and that this glycan is only provided at night. This glycan is catabolized by the symbiont, which is required for the acidification of the host organ, and this acidification is necessary for the symbiont to produce light at night. We propose that this strategy may be used by other animal hosts to regulate the activities of their symbionts. This study provides a new perspective on the role of glycans in the regulation of symbioses. (Show more)"

Our method offers a flexible and broadly applicable approach to model topics in text data. It can be used to identify latent patterns in many domains, including social media, news, and medical records. Our method can also be used to identify gender biases in topics.

This epidemic marked the start of the second plague pandemic, which lasted in Europe until the early 19th century. The climate conditions that prevailed in the years preceding the outbreaks of the Black Death have been the subject of intense debate. We show that the climate fluctuations that preceded regional plague epidemics were not caused by a singular introduction of Yersinia pestis, but rather by repeated reintroductions of the bacterium into European harbors from reservoirs in Asia, with a delay of 15 ± 1 y. Our results suggest that the climate conditions that prevailed in the years preceding the Black Death were not favorable for the establishment of the disease in Europe.

As an alternative approach, extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying the convergence of the targets and functions of the autism-risk genes to facilitate mapping out causal paths.

Here, we show that the proteins that are found in inclusions in the brain and spinal cord of ALS patients are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. To explain the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in the brain and spinal cord, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. Our results suggest that the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in ALS is a consequence of the disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in motor neurons. This finding has implications for the development of therapeutic strategies for ALS. (Read more)"

To understand how sequential proteolysis contributes to MERS-CoV infection, we introduced mutations that blocked the first S protein cleavage events. These mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses trafficked past cell-surface proteases and into endosomes, whereas precleaved viruses used endosomal fusion-activating proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S protein cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence."

We identified a direct interaction between two viral RNA segments of the virus. This interaction is required for optimal viral replication and favors the copackaging of the interacting RNA segments. Our results indicate that the interaction we identified is a mechanism that the virus uses to overcome the limitation of the genome packaging. This mechanism is not widely conserved among influenza A viruses, which might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses. Our results have implications for the evolution of the virus and for the development of antiviral strategies. (Show more)"

The development of atherosclerotic lesions is a complex process that involves a series of events, including the activation of proatherosclerotic phenotypes of vascular endothelial cells (ECs). The objective of this study is to investigate the functional role of Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) in the flow regulation of atheroprone endothelial phenotypes and the consequential development of atherosclerotic lesions. Our results demonstrate that the activation of YAP/TAZ by disturbed flow is a critical event in the development of atheroprone phenotypes and atherosclerotic lesions. Therefore, inhibition of YAP/TAZ activation is a promising athero-protective therapeutic strategy. Our study provides a mechanistic understanding of the role of YAP/TAZ in the development of atherosclerotic lesions and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of atherosclerosis.

We evaluate government records of wildfires that were extinguished or managed by state or federal agencies from 1992 to 2012, and examine geographic and seasonal extents of human-ignited wildfires relative to lightning-ignited wildfires. Humans have vastly expanded the spatial and seasonal “fire niche” in the United States, accounting for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned."

We connect changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods with economic and demographic data and find that three factors predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities. Our method can be used to monitor the physical appearance of cities over time and to study the physical dynamics of urban change.

Our study provides insights into the underlying causes of the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis, which is a key step in the progression of bleaching. We show that the metabolic interactions between the coral host and its algal symbionts are altered during heat stress, leading to a shift from carbon uptake to release by the coral holobiont. This, in turn, promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates, which ultimately leads to the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis. Our findings provide a missing link in our understanding of the stability of the coral holobiont and may help us to predict the fate of coral reefs in the future."

FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity.

We show that striatonigral fibers originating in striosomes form highly unusual bouquet-like arborizations that target bundles of ventrally extending dopamine-containing dendrites and clusters of their parent nigral cell bodies. These clustered cell bodies in turn project to the striatum as part of the classic nigrostriatal pathway. Thus, these striosome–dendron bouquets likely represent subsystems with the nigro–striato–nigral loop that are affected in human disorders including Parkinson’s disease. Given evidence that striosomes receive input from cortical regions related to the control of mood and motivation and that they link functionally to reinforcement and decision-making, the striosome–dendron bouquets could be critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease."

We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants.
