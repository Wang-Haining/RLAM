Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans is not well understood, we show that myxozoans are cnidarians and are a sister taxon to the cnidarian parasite Polypodium hydriforme. We also show that the genome size of myxozoans is one of the smallest reported animal genomes. This reduction in genome size is accompanied by a loss of genes important for multicellular development. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content.
The evolution of multicellularity is one of the most important events in the history of life. The transition from a single-celled to a multicellular organism is a complex process that requires the evolution of a number of key developmental genes and signaling pathways. The evolution of multicellularity is thought to have occurred independently in a number of different lineages, including the cnidarians, the echinoderms, and"

Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 Orf6, a viral accessory protein, is able to inhibit the antiviral action of the host transcription factor Nup98-Rae1 by directly interacting with it. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal domain of Orf6, which is required for viral replication.

The molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. We use voltage clamp fluorometry to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated and resting states of Hv1, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant LMH species in semiarid African savanna. Species differed in diet breadth, composition, and overlap, and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. This suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.

The genome sequence of M. lepromatosis is available, but its origin and evolution are unknown. We sequenced the genome of M. lepromatosis from a skin biopsy of a Mexican patient and compared it with that of M. leprae. We found that M. lepromatosis is a recently evolved lineage of M. leprae, and that it is closely related to the MRCA of M. leprae. The two leprosy bacilli are remarkably similar, and their genomes are conserved to the extent that they can cause similar pathologic conditions.

This is the case for the Heisenberg chain, where the entanglement of the system is determined by the entanglement of the environment. The entanglement of the environment is determined by the entanglement of the system, and so on. This is a self-referential process, which is not only a consequence of the Heisenberg picture, but also a consequence of the quantum world. The self-referential process is the origin of the so-called quantum paradoxes, which are the most important unsolved problems in quantum mechanics. We show that the paradoxes are not paradoxes at all, but rather the consequence of the self-referential process. We also show that the paradoxes are not a problem for the Heisenberg picture, but rather a consequence of the standard picture. We show that the standard picture is a more general picture, which is not only applicable to the Heisenberg chain, but also to the Heisenberg group.

Here, we show that RppH recognizes and binds to Np4-capped 5′ ends of RNA transcripts, which are the most abundant in the cell, and that this recognition is distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5′ termini. This mechanism of substrate recognition is critical for the regulation of gene expression during disulfide stress.

We find that the risk of frost damage is increasing in the temperate and boreal regions, but decreasing in the tropics. This trend is driven by the increasing frequency of frost events in the temperate and boreal regions, and the increasing resistance of temperate and boreal species to frost damage.

Jinguofortis preserves a mosaic combination of plesiomorphic nonavian theropod features such as a fused scapulocoracoid and more derived flight-related morphologies including the earliest evidence of reduction in manual digits among birds. The presence of a fused scapulocoracoid in adult individuals independently evolved in Jinguofortisidae and Confuciusornithiformes may relate to an accelerated osteogenesis during chondrogenesis and likely formed through the heterochronic process of peramorphosis by which these basal taxa retain the scapulocoracoid of the nonavian theropod ancestors with the addition of flight-related modifications. With wings having a low aspect ratio and wing loading, Jinguofortis may have been adapted particularly to dense forest environments. The discovery of Jinguofortis increases"

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a substantial reduction in life expectancy in the United States, with disproportionate effects on Black and Latino populations. We estimate that life expectancy at birth in the United States will be reduced by 1.13 y, and life expectancy at age 65 y will be reduced by 0.87 y, relative to what would have been expected without the pandemic. The Black and Latino populations are estimated to experience reductions in life expectancy at birth of 2.10 y and 3.05 y, respectively, both of which are several times the 0.68-y reduction for Whites. These projections imply an increase of nearly 40% in the Black−White life expectancy gap, from 3.6 y to over 5 y, thereby eliminating progress made in reducing this differential since 2006.

We use a coupled climate–carbon cycle model to quantify the effect of changing fire regimes on climate and carbon. We find that fire suppression has been a major driver of climate change, but that recent and predicted future reductions in fire activity may offset ∼5 to 10 y of global CO2 emissions at today’s levels, reducing warming by up to 0.11 °C by 2100. This highlights the importance of fire in the carbon cycle and the potential for fire suppression to be a major driver of climate change.

The squid provides the symbionts with a protected environment and a steady supply of nutrients, while the symbionts provide the squid with light production. The squid’s immune cells, hemocytes, are the primary producers of the symbionts’ food, chitin, which is released into the symbiotic organ each night. We show that the chitin is metabolized by the symbionts, and that this catabolism is required for the maintenance of the symbiont population. We also show that the symbionts’ light production is enhanced by the periodic acidification of the symbiotic organ, which is also dependent on the chitin catabolism. We propose that other animal hosts may similarly regulate the activities of epithelium-associated microbial communities through the strategic provision of specific nutrients, whose catabolism modulates conditions like pH or anoxia in their symbionts’ habitat.

Our analysis reveals no significant differences in the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration between control and warmed plots in all biomes, with the exception of deserts and boreal forests. Thus, our data provide limited evidence of acclimation of soil respiration to experimental warming in several major biome types, contrary to the results from multiple single-site studies. Moreover, across all nondesert biomes, respiration rates with and without experimental warming follow a Gaussian response, increasing with soil temperature up to a threshold of ∼25 °C, above which respiration rates decrease with further increases in temperature. This consistent decrease in temperature sensitivity at higher temperatures demonstrates that rising global temperatures may result in regionally variable responses in soil respiration, with colder climates being considerably more responsive to increased ambient temperatures compared with"

Here, we show that the behavioral inflexibility in autism is due to the inability to forget. We used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and found that loss-of-function mutations in five autism-risk genes led to impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to activate Rac1-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA repair are not fully understood. Here, we systematically investigated the transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis of alkylated DNA lesions by RNA polymerase II (pol II). We found distinct stalling profiles for the three regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (EtdT) lesions. The transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion is bypassed by a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation. The N3-EtdT lesion is bypassed by multiple routes. The major-groove O4-EtdT lesion is bypassed by a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II. The results from the present in vitro transcriptional studies are well correlated with in vivo transcriptional mutagenesis analysis.

We estimate that freshwater fisheries provide the equivalent of all dietary animal protein for 158 million people. However, the spatial coincidence of productive fisheries and poor food security highlights the high stakes for improving fishery management. We derive a global map of riverine fisheries and assess its implications for biodiversity conservation, fishery sustainability, and food security. We find that the most productive rivers are also the"

We identified a gene, SlTNH1, essential for the biosynthesis of aromatic and aliphatic nitrogenous volatiles in tomato fruit. Silencing of this gene in transgenic plants abolished the production of these volatiles in ripe fruit. Nicotiana benthamiana plants expressing SlTNH1 readily transformed synthetic 2-substituted tetrahydrothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid substrates into a mixture of the corresponding 2-substituted oxime, nitro, and nitrile volatiles. This pathway is a major step forward in understanding and ultimately improving tomato flavor quality.

The internalization efficiency of DNA nanostructures depends on the DNA nanostructure size, shape, compactness, and stiffness, and the location of the siRNA attachment locus on the nanostructure. Our work establishes the feasibility of biomolecule delivery to plants with DNA nanostructures and also assesses the impact of DNA nanostructure geometry for gene silencing mechanisms.
The use of DNA nanostructures for the delivery of biomolecules to plants is a relatively new field of research. The delivery of biomolecules to plants is a challenging task due to the plant cell wall, which is absent in mammalian cells. The delivery of biomolecules to plants using DNA nanostructures is a promising strategy, as the DNA nanostructure can be designed to have a high affinity for the plant cell wall and to be able to internalize into"

We used a snapshot of nutrient inputs from nearly all tributaries of Lake Michigan to determine how land cover and dams alter nutrient inputs across watershed sizes. We found that the 6 largest tributaries accounted for ∼70% of the daily N and P delivered to Lake Michigan, but that small tributaries exhibited nutrient loads that were high for their size and biased toward dissolved inorganic forms. Our findings reveal an underappreciated role that small streams may play in driving coastal eutrophication in large water bodies.

However, the impact of certification on deforestation and fire in oil palm plantations remains unclear. We use a comprehensive dataset of RSPO-certified and noncertified oil palm plantations in Indonesia to evaluate the impact of certification on deforestation and fire from 2001 to 2015. We find that certification lowered deforestation by 33% from a counterfactual of 9.8 to 6.6% y−1. However, most plantations contained little residual forest when they received certification, and certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation.
