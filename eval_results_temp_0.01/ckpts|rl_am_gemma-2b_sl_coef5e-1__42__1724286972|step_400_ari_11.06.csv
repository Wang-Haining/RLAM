This finding has important implications for the understanding of the structure of hydrate formed by other intermolecular interactions. It also provides a new route for the synthesis of new hydrates.

The evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, and a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we present a genomic and transcriptomic analysis of two distantly related myxozoan species and compare them to the transcriptome and genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results show that the myxozoan body plan was reduced to the bare minimum, with a small genome and a lack of key signaling pathways and transcriptional factors important for multicellular development. These results provide insight into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

However, the extent to which they partition resources is poorly understood. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammalian herbivores in semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and that dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages.

We determined the ages of 40 large presolar silicon carbide grains extracted from the Murchison CM2 meteorite. We found that the grains condensed in outflows of asymptotic giant branch stars &lt;4.9 Ga ago. This is an episode of enhanced star formation that possibly occurred during an intergalactic phase of star formation. We also found that the grains have interstellar lifetimes of &lt;300 Ma. This is shorter than theoretical estimates for large grains. We conclude that the grains were part of aggregates in the interstellar medium. The grains acquired the bulk of their cosmogenic nuclides in the interstellar medium and not by exposure to an enhanced particle flux of the early active sun.

However, the number of trainable parameters in these networks is often large, which makes them difficult to train and apply in practice. Here, we introduce a network architecture that is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters. The proposed architecture is based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is easy to implement, train, and apply in practice. We compare results of the proposed architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters. This makes it easier to train and apply in practice. The proposed architecture is also easier to implement in hardware, which may be useful for applications in autonomous vehicles.

We present a continuous, first-of-its-kind 1.3-My record of continental hydroclimate and lake-level variability from Lake Malawi. We observe dramatic shifts in effective moisture, resulting in large-scale changes in one of the world’s largest lakes and most diverse freshwater ecosystems. We show that the climate was drier before 800,000 years ago, and water levels changed frequently. Following the MPT high-amplitude lake level variations dominate the record. From 800 to 100 ka, a deep, often overfilled lake occupied the basin, indicating a wetter climate. These highstands were interrupted by prolonged intervals of extreme drought. Periods of high lake level are observed during times of high eccentricity. The extreme hydroclimate variability exerted a profound influence on the Lake Malawi endemic cichlid fish species flock. The geographically extensive habitat reconfiguration provided novel ecological opportunities, enabling new populations to differentiate rapidly to distinct species.

APOE4 decreases the rate of synapse pruning, whereas APOE2 increases it. We also show that APOE4 increases the rate of accumulation of senescent synapses in the brain. These studies suggest that APOE4 may be associated with AD risk in part because of defective astrocytic phagocytic capacity, which accelerates the rate of accumulation of senescent synapses.

The temperature inferred from isotopic data is ∼15 °C today, but this value is subject to question due to uncertainties regarding oceanic isotopic compositions, diagenetic or metamorphic resetting of the isotopic record, and depositional environments. We here present a method for determining the temperature of ancient Earth surfaces based on the thermostability of reconstructed ancestral enzymes. Our results suggest that Earth’s surface temperature decreased over geological time from ∼65–80 °C in the Archean.

The K+ channel BK has two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. We found that BK channel C-type inactivation is state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. We propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. Our findings may help us understand the mechanism of K+ channel inactivation and may provide a new approach for drug development. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

We show that it can avoid an excess mortality rate of 3.6 million per year from outdoor air pollution worldwide. This could be up to 5.55 million per year by additionally controlling nonfossil anthropogenic sources. Globally, fossil-fuel-related emissions account for about 65% of the excess mortality, and 70% of the climate cooling by anthropogenic aerosols. The chemical influence of air pollution on aerosols contributes to the aerosol cooling. Since aerosols mask the anthropogenic rise in global temperature, removing fossil-fuel-generated particles liberates 0.51(±0.03) °C and all pollution particles 0.73(±0.03) °C warming. We conclude that a rapid phaseout of fossil-fuel-related emissions and major reductions of other anthropogenic sources are needed to save millions of lives, restore aerosol-perturbed rainfall patterns, and limit global warming to 2 °C.

In the hypothesized RNA world, before the evolution of proteins, genetic information was stored in RNA molecules. In the laboratory, RNA molecules can be replicated by RNA polymerases, but the properties of these enzymes are unknown. Here, we report the results of an in vitro evolution experiment that improved the activity and generality of an RNA polymerase ribozyme. The improved polymerase can synthesize a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and, in low yield, even tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins. This work provides a foundation for the study of the origin of life. (Read more)"

We find that neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements. Neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, these results provide support for three classical theories of urban change.

We demonstrate that the protein alters the integrity of the peritrophic matrix and gut barrier, which are critical obstacles for pathogen colonization. Mechanistically, the protein binds the terminal d-alanine residue of the peptidoglycan cell wall polymer, resulting in altered permeability and the capacity of bacteria to form biofilms. These data elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which a human pathogen appropriates an arthropod antibacterial protein to alter the gut microbiota and more effectively colonize the vector.

The color of a vertebrate can be modified by pigments, such as carotenoids, or by the color of its bones and other tissues, called “chroma.” The latter is determined by the concentration of biliverdin, a pigment that is produced by the catabolism of the pigment bilirubin. We show that the evolution of high biliverdin concentrations has occurred multiple times in vertebrates. We also describe a new mechanism for the evolution of color, which is based on the presence of a serpin family protein that binds biliverdin. This serpin is most similar to human alpha-1-antitrypsin, but with a remarkable functional diversification.

We introduce a method to identify latent patterns in text data. We use a sparse representation of an embedding space to identify a set of latent topics. We then use a generative model to infer the topic that generated a sequence of words. We illustrate our method with a prominent example of underutilized text: the US National Violent Death Reporting System. Our results provide a detailed quantitative picture of reporting about lethal violence and its gendered nature. Our method offers a flexible and broadly applicable approach to model topics in text data. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

However, this interpretation is challenged by the existence of multiple introductions of the bacterium into Europe, which are often assumed to have been caused by the arrival of rats. We show that the climate conditions in Asia were favorable for the survival of the bacterium for centuries before the first plague outbreaks in Europe. Our results suggest that the bacterium was repeatedly introduced into Europe, with a delay of 15 ± 1 y. This finding challenges the assumption that the Black Death was caused by a single introduction of Yersinia pestis. Our results also suggest that the Black Death was not a single event but rather a series of events.

The identification of targets for therapy is therefore a major challenge. We show here that a monoclonal antibody targeting the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) is effective in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that the observed therapeutic effects are mediated by effector-cell–mediated cytotoxicity and that natural killer cells are a critical effector cell type. We further show that an antibody targeting IL1RAP can also inhibit proliferation of primary AML cells. These results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This approach may be applicable to other diseases with a similar mechanism of action.

This increase is driven by a combination of a drying trend and a change in the frequency of extreme droughts. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% under an intermediate-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5) and to 80% under a high-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5-8.5).

In this study, we generated conditional knockout (CKO) mice that lack ASK1 in T cells, dendritic cells, microglia/macrophages, microglia, or astrocytes. We found that ASK1 deficiency in microglia/macrophages and astrocytes ameliorated the disease severity in EAE. ASK1 signaling in microglia/macrophages was critical for the generation and maintenance of disease. Activated astrocytes produced key inflammatory mediators, including CCL2, which further activated and recruited microglia/macrophages. Astrocyte-specific analysis revealed that CCL2 expression was higher in the later stage compared with the early stage, suggesting a greater proinflammatory role of astrocytes in the later stage. Our findings suggest that glial ASK1 is a promising therapeutic target for reducing neuroinflammation.

The etiology of autism is so complicated because it involves the effects of variants of several hundred risk genes along with the contribution of environmental factors. Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that behavioral inflexibility resulted from the inability to forget. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

Bats are increasingly recognized as potential reservoirs of many viruses that cause zoonotic disease outbreaks. However, the mechanisms that facilitate virus spillover from bats are not well understood. Here, we identified and characterized a protein that is highly concentrated in the submandibular salivary gland of the bat, Myotis pilosus. This protein, named MTX, selectively inhibits the epoxide hydrolase function of leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) to inhibit LTA4 hydrolysis and the generation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a potent lipid chemoattractant for host defense against infection. MTX potently inhibited proinflammatory proteases to induce immune tolerance and maintain high stability. In mouse models, influenza A virus (IAV) infection and pathogenicity were exacerbated by MTX but were reversed by interfering with the effects of MTX on LTA4H or exogenous LTB4 administration.

The disease is caused by mutations in a number of proteins, including super-aggregation-prone proteins such as superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), the TDP-43 protein, and Fused in Sarcoma (FUS). We show that the proteins that form inclusions in the brain and spinal cord are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins. Rather, they are a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. Our results suggest that the inclusion bodies in ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons. This metastable state may be a consequence of the disease-related loss of protein homeostasis in motor neurons. Our results may help to explain the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in various forms of ALS. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Some have proposed that the origin of the flowering plants was in a dark forest habitat, while others have proposed that the origin was in an open aquatic habitat. The research presented here centers on Montsechia vidalii, a plant first recovered from lithographic limestone deposits in the Pyrenees of Spain more than 100 y ago. Montsechia has been poorly understood and misinterpreted in the past. Now, based upon the study of more than 1,000 carefully prepared specimens, a detailed analysis of Montsechia is presented. The morphology and anatomy of the plant, including aspects of its reproduction, suggest that Montsechia is sister to Ceratophyllum (whenever cladistic analyses are made with or without a backbone). Montsechia was an aquatic angiosperm living and reproducing below the surface of the water, similar to Ceratophyllum. Montsechia is Barremian in age, raising questions about the very early divergence of the Ceratophyllum clade compared with its position as sister to eudicots in many cladistic analyses.

We show that the glycan is required for the persistence of the symbiont and for the acidification of the luminal environment. We propose that this glycan is a nutrient that is provisioned to the symbionts at night, when the squid is resting, and that its catabolism modulates the conditions in which the symbionts live. This study provides a new perspective on the regulation of symbiont populations and the conditions in which they live.

We found that the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion is error-free, whereas a dominant error-prone route is observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion. For the N3-EtdT lesion that disrupts base pairing, multiple transcriptional lesion bypass routes were found. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop). The Pro-Gate loop faces toward the minor groove of RNA:DNA hybrid and is involved in modulating the translocation of minor-groove alkylated DNA template after nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion.

This interaction is required for optimal viral replication and favors the copackaging of the interacting viral RNA segments. Our results indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions.

Human-caused wildfires have expanded the geographic and seasonal fire niche in the United States, and have increased the economic and ecological costs of wildfire. This expansion has been driven by human activities, including the development of the western United States and the expansion of the agricultural frontier into the wildland-urban interface.

Neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

SAN cells are responsible for setting the heart rate and are critical for maintaining a normal heart rate in health and disease. The SAN is composed of specialized cardiomyocytes, the sinoatrial (SAN) cells (SANCs), which are responsible for setting the heart rate. We report here that stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is a key regulator of SANC automaticity. We show that STIM1 is selectively expressed in SANCs and is required for the maintenance of SAN function. Our results reveal that STIM1 regulates the electrical activity of SANCs by modulating the content of Ca2+ stores and the surface expression of ion channels. These findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms that govern SAN function and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for treating heart failure.
