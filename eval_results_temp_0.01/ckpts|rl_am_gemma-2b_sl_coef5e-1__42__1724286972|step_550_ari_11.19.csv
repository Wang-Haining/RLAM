However, the structure of hydrate with guest molecules is still unclear. In this work, we report the structure of hydrate with neon. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The structure of hydrate with neon is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. This work provides a new insight into the structure of hydrate. It also provides a new way to store gases.

The evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, and a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we present the first genomic and transcriptomic analyses of two distantly related myxozoan species. Our results show that the Myxozoa are a sister group to the cnidarian parasite Polypodium hydriforme. We also show that the Myxozoa have one of the smallest reported animal genomes. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content.

We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 channel.

We found that the proportion of plant species consumed by each species varied widely, even among closely related species. These differences in diet breadth suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may be misleading when studying the interactions between large herbivores and plants.

The record shows evidence for 24 lake level drops of more than 200 m during the Late Quaternary, including 15 lowstands when water levels were more than 400 m lower than modern. A dramatic shift is observed at the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT), consistent with far-field climate forcing, which separates vastly different hydroclimate regimes before and after 800,000 years ago.

We compared the effects of reading an electronic book on a light-emitting device (LE-eBook) with reading a printed book in the hours before bedtime. Participants reading an LE-eBook took longer to fall asleep and had reduced evening sleepiness, reduced melatonin secretion, later timing of their circadian clock, and reduced next-morning alertness than when reading a printed book. These results demonstrate that evening exposure to an LE-eBook phase-delays the circadian clock, acutely suppresses melatonin, and has important implications for understanding the impact of such technologies on sleep, performance, health, and safety.

We also found that APOE4 increases the accumulation of complement protein C1q in the brain.

Specifically, marijuana abusers show reduced decreases in striatal dopamine and in the brain’s reward center. These findings suggest that chronic marijuana use is associated with decreased brain reactivity to DA stimulation. This decreased reactivity might contribute to the negative emotionality and addictive behaviors of marijuana abusers.

We found that M. lepromatosis has lost several enzymes required for amino acid synthesis, and that M. leprae has a defective heme pathway. These differences may contribute to the pathogenesis of the two diseases.

We used a grid-based approach to sample the genomic diversity across the island. We find a common Bantu and Austronesian descent for all Malagasy individuals. We also find that the settlement of Madagascar happened recently, with a rapid demographic growth. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the settlement was not homogeneous. This suggests that the colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia happened independently. Finally, we show that a few centuries are sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. This is important for the interpretation of genetic studies in Madagascar.

In bacteria, they function as precursors to nucleoside tetraphosphate (Np4) RNA caps. Removal of these caps is critical for initiating 5′ end-dependent degradation of those RNAs, potentially affecting bacterial adaptability to stress. Here, we show that the RNA pyrophosphohydrolase RppH assumes a leading role in decapping those transcripts, preferring them as substrates over their triphosphorylated and diphosphorylated counterparts. This enzyme recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5′ termini, resulting in a one-nucleotide shift in substrate specificity. The unconventional manner in which RppH recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress.

Ion channels are also regulated by channel opening and closing. Ion channels commonly possess two gates, one for fast channel opening/closing and the other for slow channel inactivation/recovery. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that BK channels show slow C-type inactivation/recovery. We propose that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also propose that BK channel C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The seasonal outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in ambient humidity. However, the impact of humidity on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low humidity makes them more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

Since aerosols mask the anthropogenic rise in global temperature, removing fossil-fuel-generated particles liberates 0.5 °C globally. The steep temperature increase from removing aerosols can be moderated to about 0.3 °C by the simultaneous reduction of tropospheric ozone and methane.

Here, we show that an RNA polymerase ribozyme can be evolved to improve its activity and generality, and that the improved polymerase can replicate RNA, amplify RNA templates, and synthesize a variety of functional RNA molecules. These results suggest that RNA-based life may be more general than previously thought. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

However, it is difficult to observe and measure. In this paper, we introduce a computer vision method to measure changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods from time-series street-level imagery. We find that three factors predict neighborhood improvement: the density of college-educated adults, the initial appearance of the neighborhood, and proximity to other attractive neighborhoods. Our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

The cause of the extinction is still debated. The age model for the extinction is critical to understanding the extinction mechanism. We present a precise age model for the extinction based on U-Pb dates of volcanic ash beds. The age model shows that the extinction occurred between 251.941 ± 0.037 and 251.880 ± 0.031 Mya. The carbon cycle was highly volatile immediately preceding the extinction. The carbon cycle volatility persisted for ∼500 ka before a return to near preextinction values. The age model will allow a refined evaluation of the relative roles of rate-dependent processes contributing to the extinction. This will establish an accurate time point for evaluating the plausibility of trigger and kill mechanisms. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

The IL1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) is expressed on candidate leukemic stem cells in the majority of AML patients, but not on normal hematopoietic stem cells. We show that monoclonal antibodies targeting IL1RAP have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects. We also show that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Finally, we generated an antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. These results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This approach may be applicable to other cancers.

The recent settlement of Madagascar happened in a sex-biased way, with a higher contribution of males from Southeast Asia. In addition, we find that Madagascar is a young population, with a strong influence of geography on the present genomic diversity.

Some of these RNAs encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The RNA encodes a 28-amino acid protein that increases the activity of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. We also show that the RNA base pairs with two genes and that the base pairing and protein functions compete.

The neural mechanisms underlying this ability are not well understood. Here we propose a computational model of memory in the human brain. Our model is based on the idea that memory is supported by changes in the excitability of individual neurons. These changes are adaptive and can be used to store information. We show that this mechanism can support memory on different timescales. We demonstrate that it can be used to bind information over time and that it is sensitive to context and serial order. This work provides a step toward a computational neurobiology of language. It may also have implications for other domains of cognitive science.

This reaction is catalyzed by two unrelated enzymes using different chemistries. The majority of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria use a [4Fe-4S] cluster protein, whereas plants, cyanobacteria, and some phototrophic bacteria possess a diiron protein. Plant and cyanobacterial mutants in ycf54 display impaired function of the diiron enzyme, accumulating the reaction substrate. Swapping cyclases between cyanobacteria and purple phototrophic bacteria reveals three classes of the diiron enzyme.

The etiology of autism is so complicated because it involves the effects of variants of several hundred risk genes along with the contribution of environmental factors. Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a molecular mechanism for autism and a target for drug development.

The evolution of parvoviruses has been studied using genetic sequences from recent years. However, the evolution of parvoviruses is poorly understood because of the lack of ancient viral sequences. Here we present 10 ancient parvovirus B19 (B19V) sequences from humans who lived in Eurasia and Greenland from ∼0.5 to ∼6.9 thousand years ago. We find that B19V has been associated with humans for a long time. We also find that the evolution of B19V is slower than previously thought.

This glycan is released by the host only at night, when the symbionts are most active. The catabolism of this glycan by the symbionts is also required for the acidification of the host’s crypts, which enhances the luminescence of the symbionts.

To better understand how sequential proteolysis contributes to MERS-CoV infection, we introduced mutations that blocked the first proteolytic events. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses trafficked past cell-surface proteases and into endosomes, whereas precleaved viruses used endosomal proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry. Uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence.

We present a mathematical analysis of the within-host dynamics of ZIKV in a nonhuman primate model. We show that the virus can replicate rapidly and that the time between cell infection and viral production is likely short. We also show that the antiviral treatment favipiravir can reduce the peak viral load and shorten the time to undetectable viral load. However, the treatment is not effective in reducing the peak viral load and shortening the time to undetectable viral load when given 2 d postinfection.

However, they are under threat from a variety of environmental stressors. In particular, the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis due to heat stress is a major threat to coral reefs worldwide. We show that the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis is driven by altered nutrient cycling during heat stress. This shift from nutrient uptake to release by the coral host promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host. Our results provide a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

However, the response to chemotherapy is heterogeneous, and many patients do not respond well to treatment. We found that the expression of the orphan receptor tyrosine kinaselike orphan receptor ROR1 increased in breast cancer cells following treatment with chemotherapy. This increase in ROR1 expression was associated with the activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or BMI1. Furthermore, we found that targeting ROR1 expression with the humanized monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab improved the response to chemotherapy in mice bearing breast cancer patient-derived xenografts.

However, the role of FSIP1 in the progression and drug sensitivity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. This article is protected by copyright.

It is used to treat phenylketonuria. Less is known about the role of tetrahydrobiopterin in lipid metabolism. Here we found tetrahydrobiopterin to be essential for the activity of a macrophage-specific ether lipid cleavage enzyme. We also found that tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis and the activity of the enzyme are important regulators of the macrophage lipidome. Our results reveal a central role of tetrahydrobiopterin and ether lipid cleavage in macrophage biology. They also suggest that tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis and the activity of the enzyme are important regulators of macrophage biology. This may have implications for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

The neural mechanisms underlying this ability are not well understood. Here we propose a computational model of memory in the human brain. Our model is based on the idea that memory is supported by changes in the excitability of individual neurons. These changes are adaptive and can be used to store information. We show that this mechanism can support memory on different timescales. We demonstrate that it can be used to bind information over time and that it is sensitive to context and serial order. This work provides a step toward a computational neurobiology of language. It may also have implications for other domains of cognitive science.

However, they are difficult to genetically modify. Here, we show that DNA nanostructures can be used to deliver functional biomolecules to plants. We show that the size, shape, compactness, stiffness, and attachment location of the DNA nanostructures determine their ability to enter plant cells and deliver functional biomolecules. We also show that the endogenous gene silencing pathway depends on the attachment location of the delivered siRNA. Our work establishes the feasibility of DNA nanostructures for plant cell internalization and gene silencing. This work also details the design parameters of importance for plant cell internalization and also assesses the impact of DNA nanostructure geometry for gene silencing mechanisms.

We find that the long-time dynamics of such systems are biased toward states that exhibit a fine-tuned extremization of environmental forcing. This behavior is reminiscent of the behavior of a mechanical system driven by a random force.

Here we show that NMDAR-Ab encephalitis can cause changes in the spectral composition of spontaneous EEG activity. We then show that these changes can be explained by changes in the intrinsic microcircuitry of the cortex. Finally, we show that these changes can be used to predict the onset of paroxysmal EEG abnormalities. These findings offer mechanistic insights into circuit-level dysfunction induced by NMDAR-Ab. They also provide a framework for understanding the mechanisms underlying paroxysmal EEG abnormalities in other autoimmune encephalitis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

To understand the potential for future abrupt climate change, we need to understand the mechanisms that led to past abrupt warming. Here, we present evidence for a rapid warming event that occurred ∼304 Ma. We show that this event was associated with a doubling of atmospheric CO2 and a biodiversity nadir. We also show that this event was linked to an injection of organic matter–derived carbon into the ocean. Earth system modeling indicates that this event was linked to enhanced nutrient fluxes and thermocline stratification. These results highlight the potential for future abrupt climate change.

We show that RSPO certification reduces deforestation in Indonesia. However, certification has little impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Our results suggest that certification is not reducing deforestation in the most critical areas for biodiversity and climate change mitigation. We recommend that certification requirements be expanded to include strict avoidance of peatlands and forest areas. We also recommend that certification requirements be strengthened to include a ban on deforestation. These recommendations are necessary to ensure that certification is delivering on its promise to reduce deforestation."

Its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases. However, the study of its regulation is limited by the lethality or the severity of phenotypes in the only available model organism, humans. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 (exocyst component of 70 kDa) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. This article is protected by copyright.

In vertebrates, sex is determined by a single locus, resulting in two sexes. In species with polygenic sex determination, multiple alleles interact to determine sex. Here we investigate the effects of polygenic sex determination on secondary sexual characteristics in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii. We find that polygenic sex determination produces modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics. In addition, the modularity of secondary sexual characteristics produced by polygenic sex determination provides context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations. Our results suggest that the maintenance of sex determination alleles is not a simple process. Rather, it is a dynamic process that is influenced by the genetic architecture of sex determination.

This study provides the earliest evidence for the evolution of a key derived feature of the human hand. This feature is present in the hand of a 1.42-Myr-old hominin from Kenya. This suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo. This may have been in Homo erectus sensu lato.

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants.
