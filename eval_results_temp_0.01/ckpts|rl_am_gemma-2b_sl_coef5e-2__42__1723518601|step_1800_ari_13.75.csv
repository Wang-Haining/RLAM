The virus is able to evade the host immune response by blocking IFN signaling. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes. Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This mechanism may be used by other viruses to evade IFN signaling. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

We find that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields will increase to values much larger than present-day values, and the probability of simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year will increase. These results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes.

The best candidate is synthetically more accessible, exhibits higher solubility and binding affinity to the ribosome, and is up to 56 times more active against resistant pathogens than telithromycin. Notably, the best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. This study provides a proof of concept for the use of computational approaches in the design of new antibiotics. View Full-Text"

Popular network architectures often add additional operations and connections to the standard architecture to enable training deeper networks. To achieve accurate results in practice, a large number of trainable parameters are often required. Here, we introduce a network architecture based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice, and automatically adapts to different problems. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data."

We reconstructed the evolutionary history of beetles using a comprehensive dataset of genes from 521 species, and traced the evolution of genes enabling symbiont-independent digestion of lignocellulose. Phylogenomic analyses of these uniquely comprehensive datasets resolved controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, both major independent origins of specialized herbivory in beetles coincide with the first appearances of an arsenal of PCWDEs encoded in their genomes. Beetle diversity thus appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding PCWDEs."

In the temperate regions, seasonal outbreaks of influenza correlate with decreases in ambient humidity. While low humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes them more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings have implications for understanding the impact of climate change on influenza transmission and severity of disease. They also provide a mechanistic understanding of the impact of dry air on influenza pathogenesis, which may be useful in the development of therapeutic strategies.

This suggests that the brain uses a merge operation to build a tree of phrases. Our results provide initial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases."

However, the geographic distribution of frost events and the evolutionary adaptations of plants and animals to them are poorly understood. We show that the geographic distribution of frost events is strongly associated with the leaf-out timing of trees, and that this association is likely to be driven by the evolutionary history of the species. We also show that the resistance strategies of trees are likely to be insufficient to cope with increasing frost events in the future. Our findings highlight the need for more research on the impact of frost events on ecosystems and the development of frost-resistant cultivars."

We identify a protein that is expressed by the pathogen and that alters the composition of the gut microbiota. This protein, which is homologous to antifreeze proteins, binds the terminal d-alanine residue of the peptidoglycan cell wall of bacteria, resulting in altered permeability and the capacity of bacteria to form biofilms. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms by which pathogens influence the microbiome of their vectors.

We found that the protein interacts with the enzyme that catalyzes the final step in glycerol metabolism and that the protein interferes with the activity of the enzyme. The RNA also interferes with the activity of a second small RNA, suggesting that the two RNAs compete for the same target. This is an example of a mechanism that has evolved to control the expression of genes that are important for survival in changing environments."

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility, which resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

There is no specific antiviral treatment available for MERS, and the high case fatality rate of the disease highlights the need for effective treatments. Here, we show that remdesivir, an antiviral drug for Ebola, effectively inhibited MERS-CoV replication in vitro, and prevented the development of clinical disease in a nonhuman primate model of MERS-CoV infection. These data support the use of remdesivir in a clinical trial of MERS-CoV infection, and suggest that it may be effective against other coronaviruses. This may be of particular relevance in the context of the currently emerging novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV. The development of effective antiviral treatments for MERS and other coronaviruses is therefore of high priority."

We found that sequential proteolysis of MERS-CoV S proteins is required for infection into human lung-derived cells, but not into other cell types. This cell type-specific requirement for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. These findings suggest that the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence."

We also show that ROR1 expression is associated with the expression of genes induced by the activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or BMI1, and that ROR1 expression is associated with the enhanced capacity of breast cancer cells to invade Matrigel, form spheroids, engraft in Rag2−/−γc−/− mice, or survive treatment with paclitaxel. Finally, we show that treatment of mice bearing breast cancer patient-derived xenografts with the humanized anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab repressed expression of genes associated with breast cancer stemness, reduced activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or BMI1, and impaired the capacity of breast cancer PDXs to metastasize or reengraft Rag2−/−γc−/− mice.

We present a study of an abrupt warming event that occurred during a glacial period, and we show that the system responded with a global warming and a doubling of atmospheric CO2. We show that the warming was linked to an increase in nutrient fluxes and to an increase in the amount of organic matter in the ocean."

We show that certification has reduced deforestation in Indonesia, but that certification has no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection. We also show that certification has no causal impact on deforestation in noncertified areas. Our results suggest that certification has not yet achieved its full potential to reduce deforestation, and that certification has not yet been adopted in all forested regions. We recommend that certification requirements be expanded to forested regions, and that certification be extended to all oil palm, including noncertified areas. We also recommend that certification requirements be strengthened to avoid all peat, and that certification be extended to fire-prone areas. These recommendations are necessary to achieve the full potential of certification to reduce tropical deforestation."

The exocyst complex is composed of a large number of proteins, and the regulation of the complex is complex. We discovered a small molecule that inhibits the exocyst complex, and this study provides a valuable tool for studying the regulation of the exocyst complex and a potential target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. This study also offers a potential explanation for the correlation between the dysfunction of the exocyst complex and several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression.

However, the evolution of specialization is often considered a dead end, as it is often associated with the loss of morphological and functional optimizations. Here we show that siphonophores, a group of pelagic colonial cnidarians, have evolved a modular feeding strategy, in which each colony member has a specialized feeding structure. We show that the evolution of this strategy is linked to the evolution of the feeding structures and their prey. Our findings help to understand the evolution of specialization in predators, and the role of morphological innovation in shaping the structure of food webs."

This is because the human hand is the most complex and distinctive feature of our species. We have been unable to directly observe the evolution of the human hand because of the lack of fossils in the time interval between 800,000 and 1.8 My old. Here we show that the third metacarpal styloid process, a key derived feature of the human hand, was present in a fossil from 1.42 My ago. This fossil thus provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key derived characteristic of the modern human hand. This finding suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo. This finding also suggests that the evolution of the human hand may have been more rapid than previously thought. (Less)"

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We hypothesize that this trend is a consequence of the increase in total weight of modern farm vehicles, which is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods."
