Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we compare the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. These findings have implications for understanding the evolution of parasitism and the origin of the parasitic lifestyle. (Show more)"

Our results show that SARS-CoV-2 uses a previously unknown mechanism to block nuclear import of cargo proteins, which is mediated by the viral accessory protein Orf6. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the antiviral action of IFN and may lead to the development of new antiviral strategies. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

We used a combination of phylogenomics and transcriptomics to trace the evolution of beetle genes enabling symbiont-independent digestion of lignocellulose, and to trace the evolution of beetles and their plant-feeding habits. Our results suggest that the evolution of beetles was driven by multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding cellulase enzymes. These results have important implications for understanding the evolution of insect diversity and the evolution of plant tissues. (Show more)"

Population size was manipulated such that participants could learn from the paper planes constructed by one, two, or four models from the prior generation. These social-learning conditions were compared with an asocial individual-learning condition in which individual participants made repeated attempts at constructing a paper plane, without having access to any planes produced by other participants. Larger populations generated greater variation in plane performance and gave participants access to better-adapted planes, but this did not enhance CCE. In fact, there was an inverse relationship between population size and CCE: plane flight distance did not improve over the experimental generations in the 2-Model and 4-Model conditions, but did improve over generations in the 1-Model social-learning condition.

This mechanism reduces the required undercooling of iron nucleation, which provides a key factor in solving the inner core nucleation paradox. The two-step nucleation scenario of the inner core also opens an avenue for understanding the structure and anisotropy of the present inner core.

In the temperate regions, seasonal influenza virus outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in humidity. While low ambient humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our study provides insights into the impact of dry air on host defense and disease outcome, which may be useful for the development of strategies to reduce influenza-associated morbidity and mortality.

We also show that the brain responds to the addition of each word with a decrease in low-gamma power, which is consistent with a decrease in the probability of the word given the rest of the sentence. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases.

Here, we introduce a deep learning algorithm that efficiently enhances antibody affinity to achieve broader and more potent neutralizing activity against such variants. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a human antibody P36-5D2, which is effective against SARS-CoV-2 Alpha, Beta, and Gamma but not Delta. We show that our approach can identify CDR changes that alleviate the impact of two Omicron mutations on the epitope. These results highlight the power of our deep learning approach in antibody optimization and its potential application to engineering other protein molecules. Our optimized antibodies can potentially be developed into antibody drug candidates for current and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

This study supports the further development of remdesivir for the treatment of MERS and other coronaviruses."

In this study, we show that the squid Euprymna scolopes regulates the activities of its symbiotic bacteria through the strategic delivery of a single glycan, which is metabolized by the bacteria to enhance their ability to produce light at night. This glycan is provided only at dusk, when the squid is preparing to produce light, and is required for the maintenance of a healthy symbiosis. This study provides a new perspective on the regulation of symbioses, and suggests that the provision of specific nutrients may be a more common mechanism for the maintenance of symbioses than previously thought.

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis remain unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We found that pol II stalling at O2-EtdT and N3-EtdT sites is exacerbated by TFIIS-stimulated proofreading activity. We also identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop). The Pro-Gate loop faces toward the minor groove of RNA:DNA hybrid and is involved in modulating the translocation of minor-groove alkylated DNA template after nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion. This work provides important mechanistic insights into transcriptional stalling, lesion bypass, and mutagenesis of alkylated DNA lesions.

To better understand the mechanisms of MERS-CoV infection, we engineered viruses with mutations that blocked sequential proteolysis of the virus spike (S) glycoproteins. We found that these mutations affected virus infection into human lung-derived cells, but not into other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence. These findings may also be relevant to other viruses that require sequential proteolysis for infection."

Here, we show that the metabolic interactions between coral and symbionts are a key factor in the breakdown of the symbiosis. We provide evidence that the coral host is unable to cope with the increased metabolic demand during heat stress, which is compensated by the degradation of amino acids. This leads to a shift from net uptake to release of ammonium, which in turn promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. These processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host.

In this study, we identified a role of fibrous sheath interacting protein 1 (FSIP1) in the sensitivity to chemotherapy in TNBC. We show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. (Show more)"

However, the molecular mechanism of the exocyst complex in plants is still unknown. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the exocyst component of 70 kDa (EXO70) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

In species with a single sex determination allele, the sex of an individual is determined by the genotype at that locus. In species with multiple sex determination alleles, the sex of an individual is determined by the genotype at multiple loci. Here we show that the sex of an individual in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii is determined by the genotype at two sex determination loci, and that the sex of an individual is determined by the genotype at four sex determination loci."

The retina is also a site of high oxidative stress, which is a major contributor to age-related vision loss. In this study, we show that the redox active metal iron (Fe) is important for the health of the retina. We also show that Fe is important for the health of the retinal pigment epithelium, which is the cell type that is responsible for the removal of metabolic byproducts from the photoreceptor cells. This study provides insight into the role of Fe in the retina and may lead to the development of new therapies for age-related vision loss. (show more)"

However, the evolution of specialization is often considered a dead end, and the mechanisms that drive the diversification of predator feeding strategies are poorly understood. Here we show that the evolution of specialization in siphonophores is linked to the evolution of their prey, and that this process is not a dead end. Our findings contribute to understanding the evolution of predator specialization, and the mechanisms that drive the diversification of predator feeding strategies."

The fossil record for the evolution of the human hand is fragmentary, however, and the earliest hominin fossils are only 800,000 years old. Here we show that the third metacarpal styloid process, a key derived feature of the human hand, was present in a 1.42-Myr-old hominin fossil from Kenya. This fossil thus provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key shared derived characteristic of modern human and Neandertal hand morphology and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato. This study thus provides a new perspective on the evolution of the human hand. (Show more)"

We have developed a small-molecule inhibitor of the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), which is essential for the generation of the one-carbon unit required for cell growth. We have also identified a metabolic deficiency of one of the most aggressive types of cancer, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. These results provide a metabolic target for cancer therapy, and a metabolic vulnerability of lymphoma that may be exploited in the clinic. This work also provides a proof-of-concept for the use of one-carbon unit inhibitors in cancer therapy."

However, the impact of deforestation on people’s diets is less well understood. We show that deforestation can have a negative impact on people’s diets, and that this can be mitigated by the presence of forests. This study has important implications for policy makers, who should consider the role of forests in meeting nutrition goals, as well as other environmental and conservation goals."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants.
