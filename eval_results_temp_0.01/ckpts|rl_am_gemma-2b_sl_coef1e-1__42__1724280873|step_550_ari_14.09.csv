In this work, we report the discovery of a hydrate phase of ice II, which is formed by enclathration of neon atoms in water molecules. The guest atoms are free to move in the channels, which is a unique feature of this hydrate. The structure of the hydrate is confirmed by in situ neutron diffraction experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. The discovery of this hydrate phase provides a new route to study the structure of ice II and the properties of water under high pressure. It also provides a unique platform to study the effect of guest atoms on the structure and properties of ice. This work will have significant impact on the study of water under high pressure and the development of new materials. The discovery of this hydrate phase will also have important applications in the fields of geophysics, astrophysics, and materials science."

Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we compare the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. These results have implications for understanding the origin of parasitism and the evolution of the parasite lifestyle. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 evades the antiviral action of IFN. This knowledge will be useful to design new strategies to combat COVID-19.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of proton channels, but the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels is not completely understood. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some proton channel residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each proton channel subunit. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

We quantify the magnitude of this instability for the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. Our results underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance. They also highlight the importance of considering the impact of climate change on the variability of crop yields in the context of food security.

We found that species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption had the greatest overlap in food-plant consumption. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammal assemblages, and that diversity of large herbivores may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.

However, the global load of plastic on the open ocean surface was estimated to be on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This is due to size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

The disease is characterized by the accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregates in affected oligodendrocytes. Several studies point to α-syn oligomerization and aggregation as a mediator of neurotoxicity in synucleinopathies including MSA. Here we show that the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 is able to limit the accumulation of α-syn in a mouse model of MSA. VX-765 also reduces truncated α-syn, its monomeric and oligomeric forms, and preserves tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in the substantia nigra.

Highly correlated Ca2+ activities occurred in scattered cell clusters, and network communication links between them exhibited unexpectedly short path lengths.

A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals.

Here, we use a free-form inverse design approach to synthesize multiple hyperelastic materials with distinct properties into composite structures to precisely achieve arbitrary and extreme prescribed responses under large deformations. The digitally synthesized structures exhibit organic shapes and motions with irregular distributions of material phases. Within the structures, different materials play distinct roles yet seamlessly collaborate through sophisticated deformation mechanisms to produce the target behaviors.

The hemoglobin expression pattern in human erythroblasts is highly dynamic and is regulated by developmental cues. Here we investigated the role of insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) in the heterochronic regulation of hemoglobin expression in human erythroid tissues. We show that IGF2BP1 is expressed in human erythroblasts and that its expression is developmentally regulated. IGF2BP1 overexpression in human erythroid cells results in a nearly complete reversal of the adult hemoglobin expression pattern toward a more fetal-like phenotype. This phenotype is associated with reduced BCL11A protein expression and increased fetal hemoglobin levels. These results suggest a mechanism for chronoregulation of fetal and adult hemoglobin expression in humans.

In this study, we found that activating mutation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) function, highly frequent events in human cancer, confers ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells. This resistance requires sustained activation of mTORC1 and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)C1-dependent induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. Furthermore, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a transcriptional target of SREBP1, mediates the ferroptosis-suppressing activity of SREBP1 by producing monounsaturated fatty acids. Genetic or pharmacologic ablation of SREBP1 or SCD1 sensitized ferroptosis in cancer cells with PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway mutation. Conversely, ectopic expression of SREPB1 or SCD1 restored ferroptosis resistance in these cells, even when mTORC1 was inhibited. In"

Our data indicate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of plasma membrane ORAI channels. Our findings unravel a mechanism of LCCBs action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. Our data also suggest that LCCBs may be a potential target for the treatment of cardiovascular remodeling.

The policy also failed to improve populations of older-forest–associated birds. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure.

This problem can be addressed by the development of new antibacterial agents to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. Computational approaches are essential tools to this end since their application enables fast and early strategical decisions in the drug development process. Here, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

Here, we introduce a network architecture that is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters and with fewer connections between layers. The network architecture is based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting network architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data. Our results suggest that the proposed network architecture is a promising approach for achieving accurate results with fewer parameters in practice.

Results show evidence for 24 lake level drops of more than 200 m during the Late Quaternary, including 15 lowstands when water levels were more than 400 m lower than modern. A dramatic shift is observed at the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT), consistent with far-field climate forcing, which separates vastly different hydroclimate regimes before and after the MPT.

We used a comprehensive dataset of 89 genes to estimate the timing and rates of beetle diversification and traced the evolution of genes enabling specialized plant feeding. Phylogenomic analyses of these datasets resolved controversial beetle relationships and revealed that plant cell wall-degrading enzymes obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles. Moreover, corresponding (Jurassic) diversification rate increases suggest that these novel genes triggered adaptive radiations that resulted in nearly half of all living beetle species. We propose that these horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoded in plant tissues facilitated the evolution of uniquely specialized plant-feeding habits, such as leaf mining and stem and wood boring. Beetle diversity thus appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding plant cell wall-degrading enzymes.

The only currently available vaccines are based on inactivated virus or viral vectors, which are associated with safety concerns. Here, we describe a live attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate that is temperature sensitive in vitro and can be grown at the permissive temperature. The vaccine candidate is highly attenuated in vivo, resulting in reduced weight loss and lung pathology and protection against lethal challenge with the wild-type virus. The vaccine candidate is also highly immunogenic, generating neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses. The vaccine candidate is large-scale manufacturable and can be stored at 4 °C, which will facilitate mass vaccination programs. These features support the potential use of the vaccine candidate in mass vaccination programs. The vaccine candidate is also highly suitable for combination with other vaccines.

The vector of plague during this period is still debated. We developed a compartmental model for plague transmission by a human ectoparasite vector. Using Bayesian inference, we found that this model fits mortality curves from nine outbreaks in Europe better than models for rodent or pneumonic transmission. Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346–1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats. This study also highlights the importance of using a mechanistic model to understand the history of a disease. This is especially important in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, where models are needed to understand the history of the disease and inform public health decisions.

We show that reptiles have not only small brains relative to body size but also low neuronal densities, resulting in average neuron numbers over 20 times lower than those in birds and mammals of similar body size. Amniote brain evolution is characterized by the following four major shifts in neuron–brain scaling. The most dramatic increases in brain neurons occurred independently with the appearance of birds and mammals, resulting in convergent neuron scaling in the two endothermic lineages. The other two major increases happened in core land birds and anthropoid primates, which are two groups known for their cognitive prowess."

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal cells is not well understood. We have shown that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This study also provides a rationale for the development of TRAP1-directed therapies. Our results suggest that TRAP1-directed therapies may be most effective in cancers in which TRAP1 expression is low relative to normal tissue counterparts. This is consistent with the observation that some cancers express"

They are dynamic polymers that can be assembled and disassembled by proteins that regulate their stability. One such protein is cofilin, which can sever actin filaments. However, how cofilin does so in a physiological context, where filaments are interconnected and under mechanical stress, remains unclear. Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to study cofilin’s action in different mechanical situations. We find that local curvature favors severing, while tension surprisingly has no effect on cofilin binding and weakly enhances severing. Remarkably, we observe that filament segments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist, experience a mechanical torque upon cofilin binding. We propose that this ADF/cofilin-induced torque increases the severing rate constant 100-fold. A consequence of this mechanism is that cross-linked filament networks are severed by cofilin far more efficiently than nonconnected filaments in cells. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells.

We used a grid-based approach to sample at high resolution the genomic diversity (including maternal lineages, paternal lineages, and genome-wide data) across 257 villages and 2,704 Malagasy individuals. We find a common Bantu and Austronesian descent for all Malagasy individuals with a limited paternal contribution from Europe and the Middle East. Admixture and demographic growth happened recently, suggesting a rapid settlement of Madagascar during the last millennium. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the settlement was not homogeneous, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. Our results provide insights into the settlement history of Madagascar and the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island.

We show that the presence of a common modification in mRNA coding regions can alter the rate at which this can occur. Our work suggests that the ribosome can encounter a modification in an mRNA and, in doing so, change the rate at which protein synthesis occurs.

The folding intermediates are native-like and are present in the early stages of folding. The results suggest that the folding of large proteins is more complex than previously thought.

In bacteria, they function as precursors to RNA caps, which are required for rapid degradation of the capped transcripts. In Escherichia coli, the predominant decapping enzyme, ApaH, is inactivated by the very conditions of disulfide stress that enable accumulation of Np4-capped RNAs. Here, we show that, in such conditions, the pyrophosphohydrolase RppH assumes a leading role in decapping those transcripts. Unexpectedly, this enzyme recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5′ termini, resulting in a one-nucleotide shift in substrate specificity. The unconventional manner in which RppH recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress.

We hypothesized that increasing arginine availability would restore immune function and decrease immunosuppression in sepsis. We demonstrated that citrulline administration was more efficient than arginine in increasing arginine plasma levels and restoring T cell mitochondrial function and proliferation while reducing immunosuppression. Because there is no specific therapeutic strategy to restore immune function after sepsis, our study provides evidence for developing citrulline-based clinical studies in sepsis.

We show that the biomass of humans is an order of magnitude higher than that of all wild mammals combined, and that the biomass of animals is mainly concentrated in the ocean. Finally, we highlight the historical impact of humanity on the global biomass of prominent taxa, including mammals, fish, and plants.

However, the structural basis for their antifungal activity is not well understood. Here, we report the crystal structure of a unique antifungal NCR peptide from Medicago truncatula. The structure is largely disordered and contains a single four-residue α-helix and one three-residue antiparallel β-sheet stabilized by two disulfide bonds. The peptide exhibited potent fungicidal activity against multiple plant fungal pathogens, and induced reactive oxygen species in germlings of B. cinerea. The antifungal activity of NCR peptides is likely due to their ability to bind to bioactive phosphoinositides in planta, followed by penetration of the cell membrane at discrete foci, followed by gradual loss of turgor, subsequent accumulation in the cytoplasm, and elevated levels in nucleoli of germlings. The structural and functional data presented here provide a structural basis for the antifungal activity of NCR peptides and pave the way for future development of this class of peptides as a spray-on fungistat/fungicide.

We induced C-type inactivation in BK channels and studied the relationship between activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery. We observed prominent slow C-type inactivation/recovery in BK channels by an extreme low concentration of extracellular K+ together with a Y294E/K/Q/S or Y279F mutation whose equivalent in Shaker channels (T449E/K/D/Q/S or W434F) caused a greatly accelerated rate of C-type inactivation or constitutive C-inactivation.

Here, we show that the malaria parasite alters the biophysical properties of the red cell surface, increasing the cytoskeletal tension and reducing the bending modulus of the cell membrane. These changes are correlated with parasite invasion efficiency. This finding suggests that the parasite primes the red cell surface, altering the physical properties of the cell, and thus reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion.

We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that induction of antiviral gene programs is impaired in the lung of mice exposed to dry air, and that this impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

One of the main rewards plants offer to pollinators for visitation is nectar. Nesocodon mauritianus (Campanulaceae) produces a blood-red nectar that has been proposed to serve as a visual attractant for pollinator visitation. Here, we show that the nectar’s red color is derived from a previously undescribed alkaloid termed nesocodin. We identify three enzymes that are either necessary or sufficient for pigment production, including a carbonic anhydrase that increases nectar pH, an aryl-alcohol oxidase that produces a pigment precursor, and a ferritin-like catalase that protects the pigment from degradation by hydrogen peroxide. We also identify nesocodin in the red nectar of the distantly related and hummingbird-visited Jaltomata herrerae and provide molecular evidence for convergent evolution of this trait. This work cumulatively identifies a convergently evolved trait in two vertebrate-pollinated species, suggesting that the red pigment is selectively favored and that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. First, whereas MERS-CoV prefers human DPP4 over bat DPP4 as its receptor, HKU4 shows the opposite trend. Second, in the absence of exogenous proteases, both MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes mediate pseudovirus entry into bat cells, whereas only MERS-CoV spike, but not HKU4 spike, mediates pseudovirus entry into human cells.

The stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. We designed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. Surprisingly, the results indicate that human pol δ maintains a loose association with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion.

Furthermore, the polymerase can amplify RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of PCR.

The disease is caused by degeneration of motor neurons, leading to paralysis and death. The disease is heterogeneous, with different genetic causes and different clinical manifestations. The disease is also progressive, with motor neuron degeneration occurring in the spinal cord before the brain. We now report a method to rapidly produce motor neuron-like cells from living ALS patients, which can be used to study disease mechanisms and develop therapeutics. This method will also enable high-throughput screening of drugs to identify potential treatments for ALS. This will be a major advance in ALS research. The method is also applicable to other neurodegenerative diseases. This study will also help to understand the mechanisms of ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases.

However, the mechanisms by which pathogens influence the gut microbiota are poorly understood. Here, we show that the tick antifreeze glycoprotein (iafgp) is expressed in the gut and modifies the gut microbiota to facilitate the transmission of the tick-borne pathogen Anaplasma phagocytophilum. IAFGP binds the terminal d-alanine residue of the peptidoglycan cell wall of bacteria, resulting in altered permeability and the capacity of bacteria to form biofilms. These findings reveal a mechanism by which a pathogen exploits an arthropod antibacterial protein to alter the gut microbiota and more effectively colonize the vector. This work provides insight into the mechanisms by which pathogens influence the gut microbiota of vectors and may lead to the development of strategies to control vector-borne diseases. (Show more)"

However, the origin of the modern avian body plan is poorly understood because of the limited known diversity of early branching birds. Here, we describe a basal member of the short-tailed bird group, Jinguofortis perplexus, from the Early Cretaceous of China. This discovery increases the known diversity of early pygostylians and adds important information about the origin of the modern avian body plan. The presence of a fused scapulocoracoid in adult individuals independently evolved in Jinguofortisidae and Confuciusornithiformes may relate to an accelerated osteogenesis during chondrogenesis and likely formed through the heterochronic process of peramorphosis by which these basal taxa retain the scapulocoracoid of the nonavian theropod ancestors with the addition of flight-related modifications. The discovery of Jinguofortis increases the known ecomorphological diversity of basal pygostylians and highlights the importance of developmental plasticity for understanding mosaic evolution in early birds.

We show here that monoclonal antibodies targeting the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells.

Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This study also provides a proof-of-principle for the use of antibody-based therapies to target the IL1RAP pathway in AML.

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete. These findings provide insight into the dual-function"

We show that our approach can identify CDR changes that alleviate the impact of two Omicron mutations on the epitope. These results highlight the power of our deep learning approach in antibody optimization and its potential application to engineering other protein molecules.

We propose a quantitative Crop Condition Index based on crop expert assessments, and demonstrate how this index can be used to monitor crop status and provide earlier and more precise predictions of crop yields than official forecasts released midseason. Our results show that the Crop Condition Index can be used to provide early warnings of crop production anomalies, and can be used to trigger early action to mitigate the impact of crop failures.

Our analysis reveals no significant differences in the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration between control and warmed plots in all biomes, with the exception of deserts and boreal forests. Thus, our data provide limited evidence of acclimation of soil respiration to experimental warming in several major biome types, contrary to the results from multiple single-site studies. Our analysis adds a unique cross-biome perspective on the temperature response of soil respiration, information critical to improving our mechanistic understanding of how soil carbon dynamics change with climatic warming.

We show that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner. Our findings suggest that the evolutionary trajectories of plastid genomes are shaped by the interplay between macroevolutionary events and microevolutionary processes. This model can be used to infer the evolutionary history of organisms from their molecular evolution. (Show more)"

This reaction is catalyzed by two unrelated enzymes using different chemistries. The majority of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria use O2-sensitive [4Fe-4S] cluster proteins, whereas plants, cyanobacteria, and some phototrophic bacteria possess an O2-dependent enzyme, the major catalytic component of which is a diiron protein. Plant and cyanobacterial mutants in ycf54 display impaired function of the O2-dependent enzyme, accumulating the reaction substrate. These results indicate that Ycf54 is a cyclase subunit in oxygenic phototrophs, and that different classes of the enzyme exist based on their requirement for an additional subunit.

The etiology of ASD is so complicated that it is difficult to identify the causal paths that lead to the core ASD symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. We used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting.

The most recent common ancestor of all B19V has been dated to the early 1800s, and it has been suggested that genotype 1, the most common B19V genotype, only started circulating in the 1960s. Here we present 10 ancient B19V genomes (∼0.5–6.9 thousand years ago) and show that B19V has been associated with humans for a long time. We also show that the most recent common ancestor of all B19V is dated to ∼12.6 thousand years ago, and that the recombination event that formed genotype 2 occurred ∼5.0–6.8 thousand years ago.

In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We found that pol II stalling at O2-EtdT and N3-EtdT sites is exacerbated by TFIIS-stimulated proofreading activity. Assessment for the impact of the EtdT lesions on individual fidelity checkpoints provided further mechanistic insights, where the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into endosomes."

Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus using in vitro experiments. We demonstrated that this interaction takes place in infected cells and is required for optimal viral replication. We also showed that this interaction favors copackaging of the interacting viral RNA segments.

Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities. Our method can be used to monitor the physical changes in neighborhoods over time and to study the spatial dynamics of urban change. Our results also have implications for urban planning and policy. For example, our results suggest that policymakers should focus on improving the physical appearances of neighborhoods with college-educated residents and that policymakers should encourage the development of physically attractive neighborhoods near the central business districts.

However, they are under threat from a variety of environmental stressors, including global warming and ocean acidification. In addition, mass bleaching events are pushing coral reefs to the brink of collapse. We show that altered nutrient cycling during heat stress is a primary driver of the functional breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis. Heat stress increased the metabolic energy demand of the coral host, which was compensated by the catabolic degradation of amino acids. The resulting shift from net uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont subsequently promoted the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host. Energy limitation and altered symbiotic nutrient cycling are thus key factors in the early heat stress response, directly contributing to the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis. Our findings provide a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

This DLK-independent regeneration is triggered by sensory activity and is reminiscent of a well-studied form of endogenous activity-dependent ectopic axon outgrowth in the same neuron type. These findings suggest that DLK-independent regeneration is a powerful platform for gene discovery in neuronal regeneration.

However, these factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function.

However, the anatomical and functional organization of these cell types is not fully understood. Here, we used a portable two-photon microscope to record the activity of a large number of neurons in freely behaving mice. We found that grid cells, which are thought to represent the spatial layout of the environment, are anatomically segregated from other cell types, while border, head-direction, and object-vector cells tend to intermingle. These results suggest that grid cells may be organized in a distinct network from other cell types. This study provides a powerful method for studying the organization of neurons in the brain.

Dodder is a rootless parasitic plant that is able to synchronize its flowering with that of its host. We show that the flowering of the host is required for the flowering of the dodder. This study demonstrates that FTs can function as an important interplant flowering signal in host–dodder interactions. The unique means of flowering regulation of dodder illustrates how regressive evolution, commonly found in parasites, may facilitate the physiological synchronization of parasite and host, here allowing the C. australis parasite to time reproduction exactly with that of their hosts, likely optimizing parasite fitness."

We demonstrate that striatonigral fibers originating in striosomes form highly unusual bouquet-like arborizations that target bundles of ventrally extending dopamine-containing dendrites and clusters of their parent nigral cell bodies. These clustered cell bodies in turn project to the striatum as part of the classic nigrostriatal pathway. Thus, these striosome–dendron bouquets likely represent subsystems with the nigro–striato–nigral loop that are affected in human disorders including Parkinson’s disease. Given evidence that striosomes receive input from cortical regions related to the control of mood and motivation and that they link functionally to reinforcement and decision-making, the striosome–dendron bouquets could be critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease. This work provides a detailed view of the striosome–dendron bouquet, a previously unidentified neuronal formation within the dopamine system of the brain. It also provides a model for the formation of other specialized neuronal formations in the brain. This work may help to elucidate the function of the striosome–dendron bouquet in health and disease.

We asked pairs of friends and strangers to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Finally, we demonstrate that this signal is used by third-party listeners as a heuristic of how well people are connected: Conversations with faster response times were perceived as more connected than the same conversations with slower response times.

Here, we show that Si pretreatment enhances rice resistance against the rice leaffolder in wild-type plants but not in plants with RNAi-mediated gene silencing of jasmonate biosynthesis and perception genes. This interaction between Si and jasmonates is likely mediated by jasmonates, as Si pretreatment of plants with jasmonate biosynthesis and perception gene RNAi silenced plants did not enhance resistance against the rice leaffolder. These results suggest that Si may enhance plant resistance against insect herbivores by priming jasmonate-mediated defense responses.

However, decades of monitoring and regulatory efforts have focused on large watersheds, leaving small tributaries largely unaddressed. We used a snapshot of nutrient inputs from nearly all tributaries of Lake Michigan to determine how land cover and dams alter nutrient inputs across watershed sizes. We found that the 6 largest tributaries of Lake Michigan accounted for ∼70% of the daily nutrient loads delivered to the lake. However, small tributaries exhibited nutrient loads that were high for their size and biased toward dissolved inorganic forms. Our findings reveal an underappreciated role that small streams may play in driving coastal eutrophication in large water bodies. Expanding nutrient management efforts to address smaller watersheds could reduce the ecological impacts of nutrient loading on valuable nearshore ecosystems.

Agricultural intensification is a key strategy to address these crises, but little consideration is given to the role of natural landscapes such as forests in meeting nutrition goals. This study shows that deforestation can reduce people’s consumption of fruits and vegetables and thus their vitamin A intake, and that forest fragmentation can increase consumption of these foods and dietary vitamin A adequacy. These findings have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. This study also highlights the importance of considering the role of natural landscapes in meeting nutrition goals."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the discovery of a new species of sauropod in Patagonia with a compacted soil"
