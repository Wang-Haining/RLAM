However, the structure of hydrate with guest molecules is still not well understood. In this work, we report the structure of neon hydrate at high pressure and temperature. The structure is found to be in the form of ice II, which is a guest-induced phase transition. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. This work provides a new way to study the structure of hydrate with guest molecules. It also provides a new strategy to control the structure of hydrate. This work is of great significance to the development of hydrate technology. View Full-Text"

Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we present the first comparative analysis of the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species, Kudoa iwatai and Myxobolus cerebralis, and compare these to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. These results have important implications for understanding the origin and evolution of parasitic lifestyles. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that the SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein Orf6 is able to block the nuclear import of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are essential for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We found that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and interacts with the Nup98-Rae1 complex, which is responsible for the nuclear import of ISGs. We also show that a single amino acid substitution in Orf6 abolishes its ability to block nuclear import of STAT1 and STAT2. Our findings unveil a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the host immune response and may help in the development of new antiviral strategies. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of the proton channel. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits the channel will further our understanding of the channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for the channel.

This problem can be addressed by the development of new antibacterial agents to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. In this study, we present a rational design approach to identify new antibiotic candidates. The design strategy is based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. The results of this study provide a proof of concept for the rational design of new antibiotics. This approach can be extended to the design of new drugs for other diseases. View Full-Text"

However, this is not fatal. CTLA-4 deletion induced preferential expansion of CTLA-4–negative Treg cells. However, T cells from CTLA-4–deficient inducible KO mice were able to adoptively transfer the diseases into T cell-deficient mice.

We used a comprehensive dataset of 89 genes to estimate the timing and rates of beetle diversification, and a dataset of 154 genomes or transcriptomes to trace the evolution of genes enabling symbiont-independent digestion of lignocellulose. Phylogenomic analyses of these uniquely comprehensive datasets resolved previously controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, both major independent origins of specialized herbivory in beetles coincide with the first appearances of an arsenal of PCWDEs encoded in their genomes. Beetle diversity thus appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding PCW"

APOE is also a major determinant of the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes, a major cell type in the central nervous system. Here, we report a novel role for APOE in controlling the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes. APOE2 enhances the rate of synapse pruning, whereas APOE4 decreases it. We also found that APOE4 increases the accumulation of senescent synapses in the brain, which may be the cause of the increased risk for AD in APOE4 homozygotes. These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes.

We used a grid-based approach to sample the genomic diversity across the island, from the north to the south, from the east to the west. We find a common Bantu and Austronesian descent for all Malagasy individuals, with a limited paternal contribution from Europe and the Middle East. Admixture and demographic growth happened recently, suggesting a rapid settlement of Madagascar during the last millennium. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the settlement was not homogeneous, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. View Full-Text"

The temperature at which rhinovirus replicates most efficiently in the human respiratory tract is unknown. We show that mouse airway cells infected with mouse-adapted rhinovirus 1B exhibit a striking enrichment in expression of antiviral defense response genes at 37 °C relative to 33 °C. This correlates with higher expression levels of type I and type III IFN genes and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) at 37 °C. Temperature-dependent IFN induction in response to rhinovirus is dependent on the MAVS protein, a key signaling adaptor of the RIG-I–like receptors (RLRs). Stimulation of primary airway cells with the synthetic RLR ligand poly I:C leads to greater IFN induction at 37 °C relative to 33 °C at early time points poststimulation and to a sustained increase in the induction of ISGs at 37 °C relative to 33 °C. Genetic deficiency of MAVS or the type I IFN receptor in infected airway cells permits higher levels of viral replication, particularly at 37 °C, and partially rescues the temperature-dependent growth phenotype.

This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI process. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI.

They open and close their pore gates to allow or block ion flow. K+ channels commonly possess two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We also found that the BK channel C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. These findings provide insights into the mechanism of K+ channel regulation. They also provide a possible explanation for the BK channel’s unique properties, including its large conductance, low [Ca2+]i, and slow inactivation. These findings may also have implications for the development"

Despite the development of antimalarial drugs, the disease remains a major public health concern. The malaria parasite must overcome a number of host cell barriers to successfully invade the red blood cell (RBC) and begin its replication. Here, we show that the malaria parasite binds to the surface of the RBC, altering the biophysical properties of the cell and reducing the energy barrier to invasion. This study provides a new perspective on the invasion process and opens up the possibility of developing new strategies to combat this devastating disease. (Show more)"

The impact of environmental factors on influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity increases susceptibility to severe disease following influenza virus challenge. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide insights into the impact of environmental factors on host defense against influenza virus infection and disease outcome. They also suggest that dry air may be a modifiable risk factor for influenza virus infection and disease.

Whether and how this structure is built is unknown. Here, we show that the brain’s activity increases with each successive word in a sentence but decreases when words can be merged into a phrase. This merge operation is consistent with a bottom-up parser that applies equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases. Our findings have implications for the study of language in neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies.

In resource-scarce settings, such as Cambodia, the lack of laboratory capacity and bioinformatics infrastructure impedes the detection of undifferentiated febrile illness. We show that metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) can be used to identify a variety of vector-borne, zoonotic, and emerging pathogens responsible for undifferentiated febrile illness in a periurban population in Cambodia. This approach can be used to identify the breadth of endemic, zoonotic, or emerging pathogens and to deploy rapid public health response. This study demonstrates the feasibility of mNGS pathogen surveillance in resource-scarce settings. The results also highlight the need for a coordinated and ongoing mNGS pathogen surveillance to better identify the breadth of endemic, zoonotic, or emerging pathogens. (Show more)"

One of the most important proteins involved in the replication of the lagging strand is the human DNA polymerase δ (pol δ). The stability of pol δ holoenzyme is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. In this study, we developed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. The results indicate that human pol δ maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This study provides a unique perspective on the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme and its implications for the replication of the lagging strand. It also provides a unique insight into the mechanism of human DNA replication. This study will be of interest to the general scientific community and to the broader public."

Neighborhoods with better initial appearances are more likely to experience large improvements. Neighborhoods that are physically close to the central business district and to other attractive neighborhoods are more likely to experience large improvements. Together, these results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

We also show that the glycan is provided and metabolized only at night, when the squid is active and the symbiont is producing light. This glycan may therefore be used as a cue for the squid to deliver nutrients at the right time, which in turn may help to maintain the health of the symbiont. This study provides a new perspective on the mechanisms by which animals maintain the health of their symbionts. (Show more)"

We introduce a method to identify latent patterns in text data and represent documents as topic sequences. We illustrate our method with a prominent example of underutilized text: the US National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). We identify 225 latent topics in the narratives (e.g., preparation for death and physical aggression); many of these topics are not captured by existing structured variables. We then compare the gender bias of topics to their prevalence in narratives of female versus male victims. Our method offers a flexible and broadly applicable approach to model topics in text data. It can be used to identify latent patterns in many domains. It can also be extended to other types of data, such as images. Our method is a step toward a more data-driven understanding of the world."

Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. We found that the RNA base pairs with two genes, cadA and galE, and that translation of the RNA interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA. These results demonstrate that the translation and base-pairing functions compete. This is an example of a dual-function RNA that has evolved to regulate metabolism."

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk gene homologs all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. Our study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral phenotypes of autism-risk genes and suggests that behavioral flexibility is a core autistic symptom. This study also provides a framework for the identification of the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms.

However, the inclusion bodies that are characteristic of the disease are populated with a variety of proteins that do not share obvious characteristics other than coaggregation. We show that the inclusion bodies are populated with proteins that are supersaturated in motor neurons, but not in other tissues. This suggests that the inclusion bodies are a result of a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. This study provides a potential mechanism for the formation of inclusion bodies in ALS. (Show more)"

To understand how sequential proteolysis contributes to MERS-CoV infection, we introduced mutations that blocked the first S protein cleavage events. These mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses trafficked past cell-surface proteases and into endosomes, whereas precleaved viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence. These findings have implications for the development of MERS-CoV vaccines and antiviral therapies. (Show more"

YAP/TAZ knockdown significantly attenuated the disturbed flow-induced proliferation and inflammation, whereas overexpression of constitutively active YAP was sufficient to promote EC proliferation and inflammation. In addition, treatment with statin, an antiatherosclerotic drug, inhibited YAP/TAZ activities to diminish the disturbed flow-induced proliferation and inflammation.

However, the economic and ecological costs of wildfire have risen substantially in recent decades, and climate change has been cited as a major driver of this increase. Although climate change has likely enabled a portion of the increase in wildfire activity, the direct role of people in increasing wildfire activity has been largely overlooked. We show that humans have vastly expanded the spatial and seasonal “fire niche” in the United States, accounting for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. Human-caused wildfires disproportionally occurred where fuel moisture was higher than lightning-started fires, thereby helping expand the geographic and seasonal niche of wildfire. Actions to raise awareness and increase management in regions prone to human-started wildfires should be a focus of United States policy to reduce fire risk and associated hazards. (Less)"

We use this method to show that the physical appearances of neighborhoods are correlated with economic and demographic factors. Specifically, we find that neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements. Neighborhoods with better initial appearances are more likely to experience large improvements. Neighborhoods that are physically closer to the central business district and to other attractive neighborhoods are more likely to experience large improvements. Together, these results provide support for three classical theories of urban change.

This leads to a metabolic stress that can be fatal for the coral host. We show that the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis is driven by altered nutrient cycling during heat stress. The metabolic energy demand of the coral host is increased, which is compensated by the catabolism of amino acids. This leads to an increase in the metabolic energy available for the symbiont, which in turn promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host. This provides a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

This result is driven by two processes linked to the thermal tolerance of taxa. First, more diverse communities are more likely to include species with thermal traits that enable them to maintain productivity as temperatures shift from ambient conditions. Second, we find a pronounced increase in the contribution of complementarity to the net biodiversity effect at high and low temperatures, indicating that changes in species interactions play a critical role in mediating the impacts of temperature change on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

SAN cells are responsible for setting the heart rate, which is critical for maintaining blood pressure and blood flow. SAN dysfunction is a major cause of heart failure. Here, we report that stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is a key regulator of SAN function. Cardiac-specific deletion of STIM1 in mice resulted in depletion of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ stores of SAN cells and led to SAN dysfunction, as was evident by a reduction in heart rate, sinus arrest, and an exaggerated autonomic response to cholinergic signaling. Moreover, STIM1 influenced SAN function by regulating ionic fluxes in SAN cells, including activation of a store-operated Ca2+ current, a reduction in L-type Ca2+ current, and enhancing the activities of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. These studies reveal that STIM1 is a multifunctional regulator of Ca2+ dynamics in SAN cells that links SR Ca2+ store content with electrical events occurring in the plasma membrane, thereby contributing to automaticity of the SAN. This study provides insights into the mechanisms underlying SAN dysfunction and may lead to the development"

However, the importance of small tributaries has been largely overlooked, despite their ubiquity and potential local importance. We show that the 6 largest tributaries of Lake Michigan account for 70% of the daily nutrient loads delivered to the lake. However, the nutrient loads from small tributaries are high for their size and biased toward dissolved inorganic forms. This suggests that small watersheds may play a greater role in fueling coastal eutrophication than previously thought. Our findings highlight the need to address nutrient management in small watersheds to reduce the ecological impacts of nutrient pollution on valuable nearshore ecosystems."
