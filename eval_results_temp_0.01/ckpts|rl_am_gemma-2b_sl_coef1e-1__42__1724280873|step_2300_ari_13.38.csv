In this work, we report the synthesis of ice II-structured neon hydrate and the first in situ study of the structure. The results show that neon atoms can be enclathrated in water molecules to form ice II-structured hydrates. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The resolved structure where Ne dissolved in ice II is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. The vibration of Ne atoms is mainly in planes perpendicular to D2O channels, whereas their distributions along the channels are further constrained by interactions between adjacent Ne atoms. These results provide a new perspective on the structure of ice II and the role of guest molecules in the formation of ice II-structured hydrates. This article is protected by copyright.

However, it is not a theory that is easy to understand. This is not surprising, since it is not a physical theory in the ordinary sense, but rather a mathematical theory that is used to describe physical phenomena. In this paper, we provide a mathematical foundation for quantum mechanics that is based on the idea that it is a theory about linear operators on a Hilbert space."

Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we present the first comparative analysis of the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species, Kudoa iwatai and Myxobolus cerebralis, and compare these to the transcriptome and genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results show that myxozoans are cnidarians and are a sister taxon to P. hydriforme. They also suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. These results have implications for understanding the origin of parasitism and the"

In this study, we show that the accessory protein Orf6 of SARS-CoV-2 is able to block nuclear import of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and thereby impair the antiviral response. We found that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of proton channels, but the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels is not completely understood. Here, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These results provide a molecular basis for the inhibitory effect of Zn2+ on proton channels. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

Meeting the food demand of this population will become increasingly challenging as the Earth’s climate continues to warm. Earlier studies suggest that once the optimum growing temperature is exceeded, mean crop yields decline and the variability of yield increases even if interannual climate variability remains unchanged. Here, we use global datasets of maize production and climate variability combined with future temperature projections to quantify how yield variability will change in the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. We find that as the global mean temperature increases, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation (CV) of maize yields increases almost everywhere to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation (SD) of yields and a decrease in mean yields. For the top four maize-exporting countries, which account for 87% of global maize exports, the probability that they have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually"

However, the extent to which different species of herbivores partition resources is largely unknown. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammalian herbivores in semiarid African savanna. Our results show that even closely related species of herbivores can differ substantially in their diets, and that even closely related species can differ substantially in their diets. These results suggest that the diversity of herbivores may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized."

We show that the global load of floating plastic on the open ocean surface is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. Our observations of the size distribution of floating plastic debris point at important size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered.

We have identified the second Threonine residue within the TTVGYGD signature sequence of K+ channels as a crucial residue for this allosteric communication. A Threonine to Alanine substitution at this position was studied in three representative members of the K+-channel family. Interestingly, all of the mutant channels exhibited lack of C-type inactivation gating and an inversion of their allosteric coupling (i.e., closing of the activation gate collapses the channel’s selectivity filter). A state-dependent crystallographic study of KcsA-T75A proves that, on activation, the selectivity filter transitions from a nonconductive and deep C-type inactivated conformation to a conductive one.

The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice, and automatically adapts to different problems. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data."

They are also the main targets of the actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin family of proteins. ADF/cofilin are the central regulators of actin filament disassembly. However, how it does so in a physiological context, where filaments are interconnected and under mechanical stress, remains unclear. Here, we monitor and quantify the action of ADF/cofilin in different mechanical situations by using single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques, coupled to microfluidics. We find that local curvature favors severing, while tension surprisingly has no effect on cofilin binding and weakly enhances severing. Remarkably, we observe that filament segments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist, experience a mechanical torque upon cofilin binding.

We also show that the expression of antiviral defense genes is dependent on the MAVS protein, which is a key signaling adaptor of the RIG-I–like receptors.

The K+ channel KCNK17, also known as BK, is a large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel that is important for cardiac function. It is normally open and inactivated by C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel’s C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation."

In the temperate regions, seasonal influenza outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in ambient humidity. While low humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

We have developed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the PCNA-pol δ holoenzyme. The results indicate that the human pol δ holoenzyme maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion.

We connect changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities."

Here we demonstrate that the xanthocillin biosynthetic gene cluster in Aspergillus fumigatus binds copper and has a role in the regulation of intracellular copper pools. Xanthocillin-derived isocyanide products have antimicrobial properties, and copper is required for the activity of xanthocillin-derived products against a variety of pathogenic microbes. These results suggest that the xanthocillin BGC may be a source of fungal natural products that regulate copper homeostasis and mediate interactions with competing microbes. The existence of the xanthocillin BGC in several filamentous fungi suggests a role for eukaryotic natural products in copper homeostasis and mediation of interactions with competing microbes.

Despite advances in treatment, the survival rate of AML patients remains poor. The identification of the leukemic stem cell as the cause of relapse and the only source of resistance to therapy has led to the development of targeted therapies directed against these cells. Here, we show that antibodies targeting the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) are effective in the treatment of AML. This is the first report of the use of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based therapy. Our results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This approach may be applicable to other cancers as well. (truncated)"

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

This glycan is only provided to the host at dusk, when the squid is preparing to produce light. We show that the glycan is catabolized by the symbiont, which is able to maintain a normal symbiont population level only until the symbiotic organ reaches maturity. Finally, catabolism of the glycan by the symbionts is also required for a periodic acidification of the adult crypts each night, which increases the level of oxygen available to the symbionts.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas the more rigid uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into"

These effects, except for the increased expression of CRF itself, could all be blocked by pretreatment with an antagonist of the CRF receptor CRFR1. We also show that, in cultured primary astrocytes, hypoxic induction of CRFR1 and AQP4 is mediated by cAMP/PKA.

Here we present a mathematical analysis of the within-host dynamics of plasma ZIKV burden in a nonhuman primate model, allowing for characterization of the growth and clearance of ZIKV within individual macaques. We estimate that the eclipse phase for ZIKV, the time between cell infection and viral production, is most likely short (∼4 h), the median within-host basic reproductive number R0 is 10.7, the rate of viral production is rapid (&gt;25,000 virions d−1), and the lifetime of an infected cell while producing virus is ∼5 h. We also estimate that the minimum number of virions produced by an infected cell over its lifetime is ∼5,500. We assess the potential effect of an antiviral treatment that blocks viral replication, showing that the median time to undetectable plasma viral load can be reduced from ∼5 d to ∼3 d with a drug concentration ∼15 times the drug’s EC50 when treatment is given prophylactically starting at the time of infection."

The breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis is a major consequence of this breakdown, but the underlying causes remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the metabolic state of the coral host is a key factor in the breakdown of the symbiosis. We demonstrate that the catabolism of amino acids during heat stress promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates, which in turn contributes to the breakdown of the symbiosis. Our results provide a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

We identify a JNK-dependent feedback amplification loop between intestinal tumors and the microbiome. Our work highlights the importance of controlling the activity level of JNK signaling to maintain epithelial barrier function and host–microbe homeostasis.

However, the response to chemotherapy is heterogeneous, and some patients do not respond to treatment. In this study, we show that the expression of the orphan receptor tyrosine kinaselike orphan receptor ROR1 is up-regulated in breast cancer cells following treatment with chemotherapy. We also show that the expression of ROR1 enhances the capacity of breast cancer cells to metastasize and to reestablish tumor growth in mice. Finally, we show that treatment of mice bearing breast cancer patient-derived xenografts with the humanized anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab repressed expression of genes associated with breast cancer stemness, reduced activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or BMI1, and impaired the capacity of breast cancer PDXs to metastasize or reengraft mice. These results indicate that targeting ROR1 may improve the response to chemotherapy of patients with breast cancer. (truncated)"

Here, we report the delivery of siRNA to plants with DNA nanostructures. We show that the size, shape, compactness, stiffness, and location of the siRNA attachment locus on the DNA nanostructure are important design parameters for the delivery and gene silencing efficiency. Our work establishes the feasibility of biomolecule delivery to plants with DNA nanostructures and both details the design parameters of importance for plant cell internalization and also assesses the impact of DNA nanostructure geometry for gene silencing mechanisms. This work is expected to be of interest to the scientific community working on the delivery of biomolecules to plants."

We used a snapshot of nutrient inputs from nearly all tributaries of Lake Michigan to determine how land cover and dams alter nutrient inputs across watershed sizes. We found that the 6 largest of 235 tributaries accounted for ∼70% of the daily nitrogen and phosphorus delivered to Lake Michigan. However, small tributaries exhibited nutrient loads that were high for their size and biased toward dissolved inorganic forms. Higher bioavailability of nutrients from small watersheds suggests greater potential to fuel algal blooms in coastal areas. Our findings reveal an underappreciated role that small streams may play in driving coastal eutrophication in large water bodies."

These findings offer mechanistic insights into the effects of NMDAR-Abs on the brain and may help to explain the diverse range of EEG abnormalities observed in patients.

Certification is the tool most used to fulfill these procurement policies, and around 20% of global palm oil production is certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). However, the effect of certification on deforestation in oil palm plantations remains unclear. Here, we show that certification is associated with reduced deforestation in Indonesia, the leading producer of palm oil. Certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation."

This has led to the development of a new paradigm of soil compaction, with the weight of farm machinery now exceeding the safe mechanical limits of the soil. We show that this paradigm is not limited to modern agriculture, but is a global phenomenon, with subsoil compaction risk now affecting 20% of arable land. This alarming trend calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the largest dinosaurs had the largest footprints. Our findings suggest that the ecological strategies of prehistoric animals may have been a key factor in the evolution of modern agriculture."
