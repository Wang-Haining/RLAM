However, this description is incomplete because it does not capture the essential role played by the inner product in quantum theory. In this paper, we provide a categorical description of quantum theory that is purely categorical and does not presuppose any analytical structure. This description is based on a notion of morphism between categories of Hilbert spaces and operators, which we call “continuous linear maps.” We show that this notion of morphism is equivalent to the notion of quantum operation. This result provides a mathematical foundation for the operational interpretation of quantum theory. It also suggests that the theory of quantum operations is a natural generalization of the theory of linear operators on vector spaces. Finally, we show that the theory of quantum operations is equivalent to a certain class of quantum many-body states. This equivalence provides a new perspective on the problem of defining a mathematical structure that underlies quantum theory."

Here we report the results of a genomic and transcriptomic analysis of two distantly related species of myxozoans and a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results show that myxozoans are a sister group to the less reduced cnidarian parasite, and that the myxozoan genome is one of the smallest reported in animals. In addition, we find that myxozoans have lost many genes involved in development and cell differentiation, and that they have lost the ability to form a multicellular body. These results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This is an important step forward in our understanding of the evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes. Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This mechanism may be used by SARS-CoV-2 to escape the host immune response and facilitate viral replication.

In the male reproductive system, sperm cells are quiescent in the absence of Zn2+, but become active once introduced into the low-Zn2+ environment of the female reproductive tract. Zn2+ inhibits the proton channel, but the molecular mechanism of this inhibition is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of the proton channel. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits the proton channel will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because of the difficulty of quantifying diet composition at the species level. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet composition for seven species of large herbivores in a semiarid African savanna. We found that diet composition differed between species, even when they were matched in body size and proportional grass consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption, but dietary composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large herbivore assemblages, and that large herbivore diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This may have important implications for the management of large herbivore populations."

High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low-anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as decreased ATP and increased reactive oxygen species production in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals. We conclude that mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens is crucial for social behavior and is critically involved in the low social competitiveness associated with high anxiety.

The structures are digitally synthesized through a free-form inverse design approach, which is based on the physical model of the prescribed response and the material properties of the constituent materials. The structures are manufactured via multimaterial fabrication, which is based on the digital model of the prescribed response.

In erythroid cells, IGF2BP1 causes a nearly complete reversal of the adult hemoglobin expression pattern toward a more fetal-like phenotype. This is achieved by reduced expression of the adult hemoglobin genes beta and delta and increased gamma-globin expression. IGF2BP1 also mediates posttranscriptional loss of the transcription factor BCL11A, which is essential for the expression of the fetal hemoglobin gene alpha.

However, the long-term use of LCCBs is associated with the development of heart failure. Here, we show that LCCBs activate the STIM/ORAI Ca2+ sensor system in vascular smooth muscle cells, which is associated with vascular remodeling. Our findings provide a rationale for the use of LCCBs in the treatment of hypertension. However, caution is warranted in the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated.

The proposed architecture is based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data.

We reconstructed the evolutionary history of beetles using a comprehensive dataset of 89 genes for 521 species, including 154 genomes or transcriptomes. Our analyses resolved previously controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, these novel genes triggered adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of PCWDEs. We propose that PCWDEs enabled efficient digestion of plant tissues, including lignocellulose in cell walls, facilitating the evolution of uniquely specialized plant-feeding habits, such as leaf mining and stem and wood boring. Beetle diversity thus appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized"

We also found that APOE alleles are highly associated with the accumulation of senescent synapses in the brain, which may contribute to the increased vulnerability of APOE4 to complement-mediated neurodegeneration. These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes. They also suggest the hypothesis that AD susceptibility of APOE4 may originate in part from defective phagocytic capacity of astrocytes which accelerates the rate of accumulation of senescent synapses, enhancing synaptic vulnerability to classical-complement-cascade mediated neurodegeneration.

Here, we show that neurons are also capable of producing potent immune factors, and that these are released into the extracellular environment. We demonstrate that these neuron-derived cytokines correlate with the extent of microglial activation and mobilization, even in the absence of extracellular plaques and cell death. We also show that a neuron-specific inflammatory response may precede insoluble Aβ plaque and tau tangle formation within the human brain.

Our research provides a comprehensive characterization of sperm proteome dynamics and expands our understanding of the critical process of sperm–female reproductive tract interactions.

Mutations in VWF cause the common bleeding disorder, von Willebrand disease (VWD). The A1 domain in VWF binds to platelet glycoprotein Ibα (GPIbα), in a reaction triggered, in part, by alterations in flow during bleeding. We show that force application switches VWF A1 and GPIbα to a second state with faster on-rate, providing a mechanism for activating VWF binding to platelets. This mechanism explains pathophysiology and is applicable to other systems. The results are important for understanding the role of force in the regulation of VWF and other proteins. They also provide a general approach for understanding the effects of force on proteins. The approach may be applicable to other systems."

They open and close their pore gates to allow or block ion flow. K+ channels commonly possess two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that BK channels can exhibit slow C-type inactivation/recovery and that the rates of C-type inactivation/recovery are inversely correlated with channel-open probability. We propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. This study provides a new perspective on the regulation of K+ channels.

The Plasmodium parasite invades the red blood cell (RBC) to complete its life cycle and cause disease. The invasion process is poorly understood, and the role of the parasite’s erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 (EBA175) in this process is unknown. Here, we show that EBA175 binding to glycophorin A (GPA) on the RBC surface leads to an increase in the cytoskeletal tension of the red cell and a reduction in the bending modulus of the cell’s membrane. These changes in the RBC are correlated with parasite invasion efficiency. This finding suggests that the malaria parasite primes the erythrocyte surface through its binding antigens, altering the biophysical nature of the target cell and thus reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion. This would constitute a major change in our concept of malaria parasite invasion, suggesting it is, in fact, a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces working together to facilitate entry. This work provides a new perspective on the invasion process and may lead to the development of new antimalarial therapies. (Show more)"

Here we present a genome-wide analysis of a group of 11 individuals from Bavaria, Germany, who died mostly between 480 and 650 AD. Our data indicate that the genetic ancestry of the men is mostly of northern and central European origin, while the women exhibit a very high genetic heterogeneity, including signals of genetic ancestry from western Europe to East Asia. In addition, we found that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago. These results provide insights into the genetic history of Europe during the Early Medieval period and suggest that complex demographic processes may have contributed in an unexpected way to shape the modern European genetic landscape."

To understand how MERS-CoV spreads to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of two bat coronaviruses, HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results suggest that MERS-CoV, but not HKU4, has adapted to use human cells for cross-species transmission.

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete. These findings provide insight into the regulation of carbon utilization in bacteria. They also demonstrate that the translation and base-pairing functions of the RNA compete with each other.

ASK1 signaling in microglia played a major role in generating and maintaining disease, and activated astrocytes produce key inflammatory mediators, including CCL2, that further activated and recruited microglia/macrophages. Our findings suggest phase-specific ASK1-dependent glial cell interactions in EAE pathophysiology, and we propose glial ASK1 as a promising therapeutic target for reducing neuroinflammation.

It is therefore challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

We show that aggregates accumulate at synaptic terminals and progressively spread throughout the brain. These aggregates are internalized and accumulate within other neurons, demonstrating that they are not cleared by the immune system. We also show that the spread of aggregates is non–cell-autonomous, and that this spreading can be prevented by inhibiting endocytosis in the spreading neurons. Finally, we show that the release of aggregates requires fusion protein 1, demonstrating that active release and uptake of aggregates are important elements of spreading. These results provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the spread of protein aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases.

MTX inhibits the antiviral immune response of the host and facilitates viral infection by inhibiting the activity of leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) to inhibit the generation of LTB4, a potent lipid chemoattractant for host defense against infection. This study provides deeper insight into immunologically privileged sites for microbial community residence in bats and supports the therapeutic potential of targeting MTX-LTA4H.

These proteins form intracellular inclusion bodies that are characteristic of different neuropathological subtypes of the disease. Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions in the brain and spinal cord are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. Rather, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages.

We illustrate the new approach in the context of forward stepwise regression, the lasso, and principal components analysis. The new approach is more powerful and more efficient than existing methods. It is also more transparent, in that it makes explicit the assumptions that are being made about the data."

However, the generation of ECs is difficult, and the number of factors that induce ECs is still unknown. Here, we demonstrate that ets variant 2 (ETV2) alone induces the generation of endothelial cells from fibroblasts. In coordination with endogenous FOXC2 in fibroblasts, ETV2 induces expression of multiple key endothelial development factors, including FLI1, ERG, and TAL1, and induces expression of endothelial functional molecules, including EGFL7 and von Willebrand factor. Consequently, ETVECs exhibits EC characteristics in vitro and forms mature functional vasculature in Matrigel plugs transplanted in NOD SCID mice. Furthermore, ETVECs significantly improve blood flow recovery in a hind limb ischemic model using BALB/c-nu mice. Our study indicates that the creation of ETVECs provides further understanding of human EC development induced by ETV2. This study also provides a promising therapeutic approach for ischemic disorders. (Show more)"

Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus. This interaction is required for optimal viral replication and favors copackaging of the interacting viral RNA segments. Our experiments indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions. The lack of conservation of these interactions might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses.

We provide a comprehensive analysis of the geographic and seasonal extent of human-caused wildfires relative to lightning-caused wildfires in the United States. Our results show that humans have vastly expanded the geographic and seasonal extent of wildfire, and that human-caused wildfires disproportionately occur in areas where fuel moisture is higher, thereby helping to expand the geographic and seasonal niche of wildfire.

Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. (PsycINFO Database Record"

This pathway is distinct from other known flavin-dependent monooxygenases in plants and provides a major step forward in understanding and ultimately improving tomato flavor quality.

This fossil provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of this feature and suggests that the distinctive hand features of Neandertals and modern humans arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo. This study also highlights the importance of the fossil record in understanding the evolution of the human hand. (Show more)"

In mammals, SHMT1 is cytosolic, whereas SHMT2 is mitochondrial. Here we show that dual knockout of SHMT1 and SHMT2 in mice results in the death of the organism. We also show that dual SHMT inhibitors are effective in blocking the growth of colon cancer xenografts in mice. Finally, we show that one-carbon metabolism is a targetable metabolic deficiency of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. These results provide a foundation for the development of small-molecule dual SHMT inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy for cancer. They also provide a metabolic target for the treatment of lymphoma. These results are relevant to the field of cancer metabolism. They also provide a metabolic target for the treatment of lymphoma."

This study shows that deforestation can reduce people’s consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are important sources of vitamin A, and thus can reduce vitamin A adequacy of diets. Conversely, forest fragmentation can increase people’s consumption of fruits and vegetables, which can increase vitamin A adequacy. These findings have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. This study also highlights the importance of using causal inference methods to understand the effects of deforestation on people’s diets. This is the first study to our knowledge to use causal inference methods to understand the effects of deforestation on people’s diets."

We show that the increase in mechanization has led to a shift in the spatial distribution of compaction risk, with a higher risk of subsoil compaction in the modern world. This shift is due to the increase in mean tractor size, which has led to the propagation of compaction into deeper soil layers. We also show that the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods. This suggests that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles. We hypothesize that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the largest sauropods had a higher propensity to roam in search of food.
