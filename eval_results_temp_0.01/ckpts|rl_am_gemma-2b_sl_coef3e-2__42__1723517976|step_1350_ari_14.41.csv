However, it is not a theory in the ordinary sense of the word: It is not based on a set of axioms that can be used to predict the outcome of experiments. Instead, it is a collection of results of many different experiments, which have been combined into a coherent whole. In this paper, we provide a mathematical foundation for quantum theory that is purely categorical. This means that the axioms are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. Our results are based on a new notion of category of observables, which is a generalization of the notion of a measurable space. This approach provides a framework that is suitable for the reconstruction of quantum theory from first principles."

Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we compare the genomes of two myxozoans to the genome of a cnidarian parasite, and we show that myxozoans are cnidarians and are a sister taxon to the less reduced cnidarian parasite, P. hydriforme. We also show that myxozoans are among the most reduced animals in terms of genome size and gene content. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels, but the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits these channels is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of the proton channel. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits the channel will further our understanding of the channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for the channel.

Our results highlight the vulnerability of the world’s grain trade and international grain prices, especially for the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty. We also show that the magnitude of yield decline is sensitive to the rate of temperature increase, and thus, the rate of warming is a critical factor in determining the vulnerability of the world’s food production systems.

However, the extent to which LMH partition food resources is largely unknown because of the difficulty of quantifying diet composition with traditional methods. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet composition for seven LMH species in semiarid African savanna. We found that LMH consumed a wide range of plant species, and that the proportion of plant species consumed was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of consumption. Nonetheless, LMH consumed species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption, and dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in these traits. These results suggest that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized, and that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages. This study highlights the importance of diet composition in understanding the role of LMH in ecosystems. (Show more)"

Our observations of the size distribution of floating plastic debris point at important size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

The solar system is the only place in the universe where life exists. We determined the age of 40 large presolar silicon carbide grains extracted from the Murchison meteorite. The grains have interstellar cosmic ray exposure ages of 3.9 ± 1.6 Ma to ∼3 ± 2 Ga before the start of the Solar System ∼4.6 Ga ago. The grains condensed in outflows of asymptotic giant branch stars &lt;4.9 Ga ago that possibly formed during an episode of enhanced star formation ∼7 Ga ago. The grains acquired the bulk of their cosmogenic nuclides in the interstellar medium and not by exposure to an enhanced particle flux of the early active sun. This is the first time that the age of presolar grains has been determined. The results are important for the understanding of the origin of the solar system.

Here, we show that LCCBs activate the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stromal-interacting molecule (STIM) Ca2+ sensor, which drives vascular remodeling. Our findings provide a rationale for the use of LCCBs in hypertension, and also highlight the need for caution in the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated."

Our findings highlight the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and the need to ensure that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure. Our results also show that the NWFP was not enough to halt the decline of older-forest–associated bird populations, and that the policy’s success will depend on the rate of forest recovery.

The development of new antibiotics is a major challenge, since the evolution of pathogens is fast and efficient. Here, we present a rational design approach to identify new acylide antibiotics that are active against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. We show that the design strategy is successful, since the best compounds designed by us are up to 56 times more active than telithromycin, a clinically used acylide antibiotic, and they are also more soluble and have higher binding affinity to the ribosome. The best compounds designed by us are active against the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. Our results demonstrate the potential of the design strategy for the discovery of new antibiotics. This strategy can be extended to other classes of antibiotics and to other targets of interest.

This mechanism is critical to boost the proteins’ ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. Our findings provide insights into the function of this important family of proteins. They also suggest a potential therapeutic target for cancer metastasis."

However, it is difficult to be well represented in current climate models. This is due to the complexity of ACI processes, such as the influence of aerosols on water cloud droplet formation. To overcome this conundrum, we introduce the dual-field-of-view (FOV) high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) for simultaneously profiling aerosol and water cloud properties, especially water cloud microphysical properties. This instrument, verified by the Monte Carlo simulation and coincident observations of other techniques, was used to conduct a case study over Beijing. The observations show that increased aerosol loading led to increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius, consistent with expectations. However, the aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI process. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI.

In temperate regions, seasonal outbreaks of influenza virus correlate with decreases in ambient humidity. While low humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes them more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. Our findings provide insights into the impact of low humidity on influenza virus infection and disease outcome.

We also show that stimulation-induced eating is blocked by lesions of peri-LH GABA neurons, establishing them as a critical downstream circuit element for LH neurons. Surprisingly, lesions of this circuit did not alter body weight, suggesting that this system is not involved in the hunger or satiety mechanisms that govern normal feeding. Thus, we present a characterization of brain circuitry that may promote overeating and contribute to obesity.

Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. We find that the spider’s web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to capture the sound-induced air particle movements that approach the maximum physical efficiency better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By sensing the motion of web threads, the spider remotely detects and localizes the source of an incoming airborne acoustic wave, such as those emitted by approaching prey or predators. By outsourcing and supersizing of auditory function in spiders, we provide unique features for studying extended and regenerative sensing and designing novel acoustic flow detectors for precise fluid dynamic measurement and manipulation.

These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmission. Our findings provide insights into the evolution of MERS-CoV and the design of countermeasures against future bat coronavirus threats to human health. (PsycINFO Database Record"

This process is critical for the synthesis of the genome and is responsible for the synthesis of the Okazaki fragments of the lagging strand template. The stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. However, the stability of the human pol δ holoenzyme is unknown. We designed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. Surprisingly, the results indicate that human pol δ maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion.

In the hypothesized RNA world, before the evolution of proteins, genetic information was stored in RNA molecules that were replicated by ribozymes. In the laboratory, RNA molecules can replicate RNA, but the process is inefficient. Here, we report the results of an in vitro evolution experiment that dramatically improves the activity of an RNA polymerase ribozyme, allowing it to synthesize a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and, in low yield, even tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins."

We quantify the effects of climate change and human demography on fire activity and carbon emissions, using a coupled climate–fire–carbon cycle model. We find that changes in human demography tend to suppress global fire activity, keeping more carbon within terrestrial ecosystems and attenuating warming. Our results suggest that recent and predicted future reductions in fire activity may offset ∼5 to 10 y of global CO2 emissions at today’s levels. This potentially reduces warming by up to 0.11 °C by 2100. We show that ignitions and active and passive fire suppression can be as important in driving future fire regimes as changes in climate, although with some risk of more extreme fires regionally. Our study highlights the importance of fire in driving future fire regimes and the need to understand the effects of human ignitions and fire suppression. This is critical for understanding the future trajectory of the global carbon cycle."

Our study shows that the introduction of Y. pestis into Europe was preceded by repeated climate-driven reintroductions of the bacterium into European harbors from reservoirs in Asia, with a delay of 15 ± 1 y. We provide evidence for the existence of multiple plague reservoirs in medieval Europe, which were repeatedly repopulated by the bacterium.

We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

Here we use a model of Huntington’s disease to show that protein aggregates accumulate at synaptic terminals and progressively spread throughout the brain. We show that these aggregates are internalized and accumulate within other neurons, and that this non–cell-autonomous pathology can be prevented by inhibiting endocytosis. Finally, we show that the release of aggregates requires fusion protein 1, demonstrating that active release and uptake of aggregates are important elements of spreading and disease progression. These results provide insights into the mechanisms of spreading and disease progression in neurodegenerative diseases and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies. (Show more)"

To better understand the mechanisms of MERS-CoV infection, we engineered viruses with mutations that blocked sequential proteolysis. These mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Therefore, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence."

However, the generation of ECs is difficult, and the number of successful cases is limited. Here, we demonstrate that ets variant 2 (ETV2) alone can directly convert primary human adult skin fibroblasts into functional vascular endothelial cells (ETVECs). In coordination with endogenous FOXC2 in fibroblasts, transduced ETV2 elicits expression of multiple key endothelial development factors, including FLI1, ERG, and TAL1, and induces expression of endothelial functional molecules, including EGFL7 and von Willebrand factor. Consequently, ETVECs exhibits EC characteristics in vitro and forms mature functional vasculature in Matrigel plugs transplanted in NOD SCID mice. Furthermore, ETVECs significantly improve blood flow recovery in a hind limb ischemic model using BALB/c-nu mice.

However, the physiological role of these ligands in vivo is largely unknown. Here, we use zebrafish as a model system to explore the physiological function of augmentor ligands and to characterize in vivo links between augmentor ligands and their ligands. We show that augmentor ligands play an important role in zebrafish pigment development and that these ligands are essential for iridophore differentiation in the eye and the body. These findings establish a physiological link between augmentor ligands and their ligands and demonstrate that particular augmentors activate their ligand in a tissue-specific context to induce iridophore differentiation from neural crest-derived cells and pigment progenitor cells. This study provides insights into the function of augmentor ligands and their role in human diseases. It also provides a platform for the study of the function of other orphan RTKs and their ligands.

Accumulating evidence indicates that STING plays an important role in the regulation of insulin sensitivity. However, its function in β-cell remains unknown. Herein, using global and β-cell–specific knockout mouse models, we revealed a distinct role of STING in the regulation of glucose homeostasis through peripheral tissues and β-cells. Specially, although STING deficiency alleviated insulin resistance and glucose intolerance induced by high-fat diet, it surprisingly impaired islet glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), indicating a possible role of STING in β-cell dysfunction. Indeed, STING-βKO caused glucose intolerance due to impaired GSIS, suggesting that STING is required for normal β-cell function. Islet transcriptome analysis showed that STING deficiency decreased expression of β-cell function–related genes, including Glut2, Kcnj11, and Abcc8, contributing to impaired GSIS.

Our results indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions. The lack of conservation of these interactions might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses. This study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of viral genome packaging. It also provides a possible explanation for the origin of the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus of 2009.

Neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction.
