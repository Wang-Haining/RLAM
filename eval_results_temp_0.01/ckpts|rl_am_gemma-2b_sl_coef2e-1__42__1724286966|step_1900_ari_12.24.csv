Here, we present the first genomic and transcriptomic analyses of two distantly related species of myxozoans. Our results show that myxozoans are cnidarians and are a sister group to the less reduced Polypodium hydriforme. In addition, we show that myxozoans have one of the smallest reported animal genomes and that gene content and expression are reduced relative to other parasitic cnidarians. These results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This may be a general feature of parasitic cnidarians.

The disease is a serious global health problem. The virus has been shown to be able to block the nuclear import of STAT1 and STAT2, which are key factors in the activation of the IFN response. In this study, we show that the accessory protein Orf6 of SARS-CoV-2 is able to block nuclear import of STAT1 and STAT2. We show that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain. We also show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. Our results unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This mechanism may be a target for the development of new antiviral strategies. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of proton channels, but the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels is not completely understood. Here, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

This variability will increase the risk of food insecurity in these countries and, in particular, the risk of food price spikes. These results underscore the urgency of investments in breeding maize for heat tolerance. They also highlight the importance of considering the impact of climate change on the stability of global grain trade and international grain prices.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is unknown because of the difficulty of species-level identification of plant remains in traditional studies. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammal species in semiarid African savanna. We found that the extent of food-plant species partitioning was strongly dependent on the proportion of grass consumption, and that species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption had the greatest dietary overlap. These results suggest that the extent of food-plant species partitioning may be more limited than is currently assumed, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This may have important implications for the management of large mammal populations and the conservation of African savanna biodiversity. (Show more)"

However, the global load of plastic debris on the open ocean surface is still unknown. We show that the global load of floating plastic debris is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This is due to size-selective sinks, which remove plastic fragments of millimeters in size. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes.

We show that the mechanical state of the filament network can be used to control the severing rate of cofilin. This mechanism is critical for the function of cofilin in cells."

They are responsible for the flow of ions across the membrane and are involved in many physiological and pathological processes. The K+ channel BK is a large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel that is normally closed and inactivated by C-type inactivation. We found that the BK channel is open and inactivated by C-type inactivation. We propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. This study provides a new perspective on the regulation of K+ channels. (Show more)

The auditory organs of these animals are extremely diverse in anatomy after hundreds of millions of years of evolution, yet they are all made up of cellular tissue and are morphologically part of the body of the animal. Here, we show that hearing in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius is not constrained by the organism’s body but is extended through outsourcing hearing to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured orb web. We find that the spider’s web acts as a hyperacute acoustic antenna to sense the sound-induced air particle movements that approach the maximum physical efficiency better than the acoustic responsivity of all previously known eardrums. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously, up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself. The outsourcing and supersizing of auditory function in spiders provide unique features for studying extended and regenerative sensing and designing novel acoustic flow detectors for precise fluid dynamic measurement and manipulation.

Specifically, we find that neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements. We also find that neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements. Finally, we find that neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods. Together, these results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.

Onset of a major reorganization of the carbon cycle immediately precedes the initiation of extinction and is punctuated by a sharp (3‰), short-lived negative spike in the isotopic composition of carbonate carbon. Carbon cycle volatility persists for ∼500 ka before a return to near preextinction values. Decamillenial to millennial level resolution of the mass extinction and its aftermath will permit a refined evaluation of the relative roles of rate-dependent processes contributing to the extinction, allowing insight into postextinction ecosystem expansion.

We show that the climate conditions in the Asian source region were favorable for the emergence of Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that causes plague, and that the disease was repeatedly introduced into Europe via its Asian reservoirs. We find no evidence for the existence of permanent plague reservoirs in medieval Europe. Our results have important implications for the understanding of the history of plague in Europe.

However, the response of soil respiration to warming is highly variable across studies, and the mechanisms behind this variability remain unclear. Here, we synthesize the largest global dataset to date of soil respiration, moisture, and temperature measurements, totaling &gt;3,800 observations representing 27 temperature manipulation studies, spanning nine biomes and over 2 decades of warming. Our analysis reveals no significant differences in the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration between control and warmed plots in all biomes, with the exception of deserts and boreal forests. This lack of acclimation in respiration across biomes and decades of warming suggests that soil respiration may not be a major driver of future increases in global temperatures. However, the consistent decrease in temperature sensitivity at higher temperatures demonstrates that rising global temperatures may result in regionally variable responses in soil respiration, with colder climates being considerably more responsive to increased ambient temperatures compared with warmer regions. This study adds a unique cross-biome perspective on the temperature response of soil respiration, information critical to improving our mechanistic understanding of how soil carbon dynamics change with climatic warming.

Montsechia is an aquatic plant that lived below the surface of the water, similar to Ceratophyllum. This study raises questions about the very early diversification of the flowering plants and the role of aquatic habitats in this diversification."

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. We found that sequential proteolysis of the S proteins is required for MERS-CoV infection of human lung-derived cells, but not of other cell types. This requirement for sequential proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. These findings suggest that the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence. This study also provides a model for the design of future studies of the role of sequential proteolysis in virus infection. (Read more)"

The mechanisms of disease are not fully understood, but the role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of ZIKV is still unclear. Here we present a mathematical model of the within-host dynamics of ZIKV in a nonhuman primate model. We show that the model is able to capture the main features of the disease, including the rapid production of virions and the short eclipse phase. We also show that the timing of antiviral treatment is critical for the control of the disease. Our results provide a framework for the design of future clinical trials.

The underlying causes of this breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis are poorly understood. Here, we show that the metabolic activity of the coral host is the primary driver of the breakdown of the symbiosis. We demonstrate that the catabolism of amino acids during heat stress promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. This, in turn, leads to a shift from net uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont, which promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host. Our results provide a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

We show that inhibiting JNK signaling or depleting the microbiome restores barrier function of the intestinal epithelium, leading to a reestablishment of host–microbe homeostasis, and organismal lifespan extension.

Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells.

Herein, we report the delivery of siRNAs to plants using DNA nanostructures. We show that the size, shape, compactness, stiffness, and location of the siRNA attachment locus on the DNA nanostructure are critical design parameters for the delivery of siRNAs to plants. We also show that the delivery of siRNAs to plants is dependent on the DNA nanostructure internalization into the plant cell. Our work establishes the feasibility of delivering biomolecules to plants using DNA nanostructures and also details the design parameters of importance for plant cell internalization. This work will be useful for the development of plant-based biomanufacturing. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

However, most of the world’s largest lakes are drained by small streams, which are often overlooked in nutrient management efforts. We show that small streams can be a significant source of coastal nutrients, especially in the form of dissolved inorganic nutrients. This finding has important implications for the management of coastal ecosystems, as it suggests that small streams may be a major source of nutrients that fuel algal blooms in large water bodies. Our findings highlight the need to consider the role of small streams in coastal eutrophication and to develop strategies to manage them effectively. This article is protected by copyright.

We find that the long-time dynamics of such systems are biased toward states that exhibit a fine-tuned extremization of the environment. This behavior is reminiscent of the “saddle-node” bifurcation, which is a well-known phenomenon in dynamical systems. We also find that the network’s response to the environment is highly sensitive to the connectivity of the network. This sensitivity is a consequence of the network’s ability to absorb work from the environment."

Here we show that NMDAR-Ab–related changes in cortical microcircuitry can lead to paroxysmal EEG abnormalities. We use a mathematical model to identify the key synaptic parameters that best explain EEG paroxysms in pediatric patients with NMDAR-Ab encephalitis. Finally, we show that NMDAR-Ab–related changes in microcircuitry are critical for the development of overt EEG paroxysms when the same parameter fluctuations are tolerated in the in silico model of the control condition. These findings offer mechanistic insights into circuit-level dysfunction induced by NMDAR-Ab. They also suggest that the same mechanisms may be at play in other autoimmune encephalitis disorders. This may have important implications for the development of new therapies. (PsycInfo Database Record"

We show that RSPO certification is associated with reduced deforestation in Indonesia, the world’s leading producer of palm oil. However, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results suggest that certification is not a silver bullet for the palm oil industry. Rather, it is a tool that can be used in combination with other strategies to reduce tropical deforestation."

In many vertebrates, sex is determined by a single locus, resulting in two sexes. In other vertebrates, sex is determined by multiple loci, resulting in more than two sexes. Here we show that the evolution of multiple sex determination loci can result in modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics. This modular variation can be used to understand the evolutionary causes and consequences of the maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations. This work provides a framework for understanding the evolution of sex determination in vertebrates. (Show more)"
