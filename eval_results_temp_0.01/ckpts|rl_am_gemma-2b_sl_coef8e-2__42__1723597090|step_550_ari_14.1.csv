However, the structure of hydrate formed by a gas with a small atomic number, such as neon, has not been reported. Here, we report the structure of neon hydrate at high pressure and temperature. The structure of neon hydrate is different from that of conventional hydrate, which is formed by a gas with a large atomic number. The structure of neon hydrate is also different from that of ice II, which is the most stable structure of water at ambient conditions. Our work provides a new insight into the structure of hydrate and the structure of water at high pressure and temperature. It also provides a new route to the synthesis of new hydrates with potential applications in energy and environmental fields. (Show more)"

In this paper, we provide a purely categorical characterization of the category of Hilbert space operators, which is the mathematical foundation of quantum mechanics. Our characterization is based on a set of axioms that are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. This approach is a significant advance over previous attempts to provide a categorical foundation of quantum theory, which were based on the assumption that quantum mechanics is a theory in the category of Hilbert spaces. Our approach is also more general than previous ones, in that it applies to any category of operators that is closed under taking adjoints and invertible elements. Our characterization provides a precise mathematical justification for the physical intuition that the category of Hilbert space operators is the appropriate mathematical foundation of quantum theory."

Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we present the first comparative genomic analysis of two distantly related myxozoan species and a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results show that myxozoans are cnidarians and are a sister taxon to the less reduced cnidarian parasite, P. hydriforme. In addition, we find that myxozoans have one of the smallest reported animal genomes and that they lack key elements of signaling pathways and transcriptional factors important for multicellular development. These results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content.

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to block nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are essential for induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We found that SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 protein localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its ability to antagonize the antiviral action of IFN. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 evades the host antiviral response and highlights the importance of Nup98-Rae1 in antiviral defense. Our findings"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. However, the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 channel. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1.

We quantify the magnitude of this increase and its consequences for global maize production and trade. Our results show that the probability of simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year increases from 0% to 7% under 2 °C warming and to 86% under 4 °C warming.

We found that, despite being similar in body size and proportional grass consumption, these species differed in diet composition, and that dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our approach could be used to quantify diet partitioning in herbivores across taxa and ecosystems. This would be important because, in many ecosystems, LMH are the dominant grazers and browsers, and their diversity is linked to plant diversity."

Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean.

We show here that the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765, which was well tolerated in a 6 wk-long phase II trial in patients with epilepsy, is able to limit the accumulation of α-syn in a mouse model of MSA. This effect was associated with a reduction of truncated α-syn, its monomeric and oligomeric forms, and with neuroprotective effects in the substantia nigra.

In this study, we identified a mechanism of cancer cell resistance to ferroptosis, a form of regulated necrosis driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. We found that cancer cells with mutations in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, highly prevalent in human cancer, are resistant to ferroptosis. This resistance is mediated by sustained activation of mTORC1 and the induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. We also found that stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a transcriptional target of SREBP1, mediates the ferroptosis-suppressing activity of SREBP1 by producing monounsaturated fatty acids. These findings suggest that targeting the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in combination with ferroptosis induction may be a promising strategy for cancer therapy. (Show more)"

However, the mechanisms of action of LCCBs are not fully understood. Here, we show that LCCBs activate Ca2+ signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) through a mechanism involving the N terminus of STIM1. Our findings have important implications for the use of LCCBs in patients with cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. Our findings also provide a mechanism of LCCBs action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the actions of LCCBs and their potential adverse effects in patients. (Show more)"

To assess our design strategy, we tested all candidates for in vitro inhibitory activity and then evaluated them in vivo with several antibiotic-resistant strains to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

The proposed architecture is based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data. We show that the proposed architecture is able to achieve state-of-the-art results in several segmentation problems.

Phylogenomic analyses of these uniquely comprehensive datasets resolved previously controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, plant cell wall-degrading enzymes obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, both major independent origins of specialized herbivory in beetles coincide with the first appearances of these genes in their genomes. We propose that these genes enabled efficient digestion of plant tissues, including lignocellulose in cell walls, facilitating the evolution of uniquely specialized plant-feeding habits, such as leaf mining and stem and wood boring.

We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor.

They are also disassembled by the actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin family of proteins. However, how ADF/cofilin disassembles actin filaments in a physiological context, where filaments are interconnected and under mechanical stress, remains unclear. Here, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques, coupled to microfluidics, to monitor and quantify the action of ADF/cofilin in different mechanical situations. We find that local curvature favors severing, while tension surprisingly has no effect on cofilin binding and weakly enhances severing. Remarkably, we observe that filament segments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist, experience a mechanical torque upon cofilin binding. We propose that this ADF/cofilin-induced torque increases the severing rate constant 100-fold. A consequence of this mechanism is that cross-linked filament networks are severed by cofilin far more efficiently than nonconnected filaments. This mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks"

We also show that RppH decapsulates alarmones by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to decapsulate other RNAs.

However, a global, quantitative view of how the biomass of different taxa compare with one another is still lacking. Here, we assemble the overall biomass composition of the biosphere, establishing a census of the ≈550 Gt C of biomass distributed among all of the kingdoms of life. We find that the kingdoms of life concentrate at different locations on the planet; plants (≈450 Gt C) are primarily terrestrial, whereas animals (≈2 Gt C) are mainly marine, and bacteria (≈70 Gt C) and archaea (≈7 Gt C) are predominantly located in deep subsurface environments. We show that the global marine biomass pyramid contains more consumers than producers, thus increasing the scope of previous observations on inverse food pyramids. Finally, we highlight that the mass of humans is an order of magnitude higher than that of all wild mammals combined and report the historical impact of humanity on the global biomass of prominent taxa, including mammals, fish, and plants. Our results provide a global view of the biomass of the biosphere and its distribution among the kingdoms of life. They are essential for understanding"

Our model is continuous, in contrast to all known models of SOC, and is a certain scaling limit of the sandpile model, the first and archetypical model of SOC.

The instrument is capable of measuring aerosol and cloud properties with high spatial and temporal resolution. We demonstrate the instrument’s capability to investigate aerosol–cloud interactions. The observations show that the aerosol loading has no discernible effect on the liquid water path, but increased aerosol loading led to increased droplet number concentration and decreased droplet effective radius. This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation.

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, we find that women’s and men’s endorsement of HM predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. In addition, as conceptualized, HM was associated with less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors. The findings highlight the importance of psychological examinations of masculinity as a cultural ideology to understand how men’s and women’s endorsement of HM legitimizes patriarchal dominance and reinforces gender, race, and class-based hierarchies via candidate support.

We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS coronavirus, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. First, whereas MERS-CoV prefers human DPP4 over bat DPP4 as its receptor, HKU4 shows the opposite trend. Second, in the absence of exogenous proteases, both MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes mediate pseudovirus entry into bat cells, whereas only MERS-CoV spike, but not HKU4 spike, mediates pseudovirus entry into human cells. Thus, MERS-CoV, but not HKU4, has adapted to use human cells for efficient human cell entry, contributing to the enhanced pathogenesis of MERS-CoV in humans. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronav"

We developed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. We found that the pol δ holoenzyme is remarkably stable and maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA at a DNA lesion.

Here, we report the evolution of an RNA polymerase ribozyme that can synthesize a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and, in low yield, even tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life—the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules—can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins.

In others, the color is determined by the presence of a protein, such as the green color of the frog skin. This study describes the molecular basis of the green color of frogs, and shows that the green color of frogs is determined by a protein that binds biliverdin, a pigment that is formed when hemoglobin is degraded. This study also shows that the green color of frogs is determined by a member of the serpin superfamily, the largest and most ubiquitous group of protease inhibitors. This study provides a molecular basis for the evolution of the green color of frogs, and introduces a function for a member of the serpin superfamily. (Show more)"

However, the mechanisms that regulate the tumor microenvironment in response to hypoxia are not well understood. We report that hypoxia induces expression of AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), an m6A demethylase, which in turn increases the expression of NANOG, a gene that encodes a pluripotency factor. ALKBH5 expression is induced by hypoxia through the HIF-1α and HIF-2α pathways, and is required for the induction of breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) properties. Thus, ALKBH5 expression in response to hypoxia may be a mechanism that regulates the tumor microenvironment in response to hypoxia. This may be important for the development of new therapeutic strategies for breast cancer. (Show more)"

The source of the parchment, often called “uterine vellum,” has been a long-standing controversy in codicology. The Latin term abortivum in many sources has led some scholars to suggest that fetal calves or sheep skins were used. Others have argued that it would not be possible to sustain herds if so many pocket Bibles were produced from fetal skins, arguing instead for unexpected alternatives, such as rabbit. Here, we report a simple and objective method using standard conservation treatments to identify the animal origin of parchment. The noninvasive method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals; however, we did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides.

However, recent and predicted future reductions in fire activity may enhance land carbon uptake and corresponding to offsetting ∼5 to 10 y of global CO2 emissions at today’s levels.

We introduce a method to identify latent patterns in text data and represent documents as topic sequences. We first identify a set of vectors (“discourse atoms”) that provide a sparse representation of an embedding space.

We illustrate our method with a prominent example of underutilized text: the US National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). The NVDRS summarizes violent death incidents with structured variables and unstructured narratives. We identify 225 latent topics in the narratives (e.g., preparation for death and physical aggression); many of these topics are not captured by existing structured variables. Motivated by known patterns in suicide and homicide by gender and recent research on gender biases in semantic space, we identify the gender bias of our topics (e.g., a topic about pain medication is feminine). We then compare the gender bias of topics to their prevalence in narratives of female versus male victims. Our method offers a flexible and broadly applicable approach to model topics in text data.

It is also one of the most challenging evolutionary questions in biology. The molecular signature of this transition is still poorly understood. We present a model of the trajectory of plastid genome evolution during the transition from autotrophy to a parasitic lifestyle. We show that the transition to a parasitic lifestyle relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner. Our findings suggest that the transition to a parasitic lifestyle relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner. This model can be extended to other types of parasites and may help to understand the molecular signature of the transition to parasitism in general. (Show more)

We use a high-resolution climate model to show that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six. The probability of such an event will increase from 0.7 to 25% by the year 2100 under an intermediate-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5) and to 80% under a high-emission scenario (SSP5-8.5). These results highlight the strong sensitivity of the drought risk in SSA to future anthropogenic emissions. They also highlight the importance of regional climate models in assessing the impact of climate change on drought risk. (Show more)

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. As an alternative approach, extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying the convergence of the targets and functions of the autism-risk genes to facilitate mapping out causal paths. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility in autism and suggests that the forgetting process is a potential therapeutic target for autism. (Show more)"

Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions in the brain and spinal cord of patients with ALS are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. To explain the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in the brain and spinal cord, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues.

These results suggest that the timing and quantity of nutrient delivery may be regulated by the host to maintain the stability of the symbiosis. This study highlights the importance of glycans in the regulation of symbiosis. (Show more)"

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis remain unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We found that pol II stalling at O2-EtdT and N3-EtdT sites is exacerbated by TFIIS-stimulated proofreading activity. We also identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop). The Pro-Gate loop faces toward the minor groove of RNA:DNA hybrid and is involved in modulating the translocation of minor-groove alkylated DNA template after nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion. This work provides important mechanistic insights into transcriptional stalling, lesion bypass, and mutagenesis of alkylated DNA lesions. (Show more)"

To better understand how sequential proteolysis contributes to MERS-CoV infection, we introduced mutations that blocked the first S protein cleavages. These mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses trafficked past cell-surface proteases and into endosomes, whereas precleaved viruses used endosomal proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry. Uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV"

We show that the start of Southern Hemisphere deglaciation is linked to a volcanic eruption series that occurred at 17.7 ka. The volcanic eruptions led to stratospheric ozone depletion, which likely contributed to the changes in climate and circulation that led to accelerated Southern Hemisphere deglaciation. This study provides a unique example of how volcanic eruptions can trigger climate changes that led to the end of the last ice age.

Here, we identify a form of regeneration that is independent of the canonical MAPK signaling pathway and is triggered by physical lesion of a sensory dendrite. We show that this form of regeneration is linked to a well-studied form of endogenous activity-dependent ectopic axon outgrowth in the same neuron type. These findings suggest that this form of regeneration represents a powerful platform for gene discovery in neuronal regeneration. Moreover, we note numerous similarities between this form of regeneration and conditioning of the adult nervous system to regenerate after injury.

In Parkinson’s disease, the dominant RSN was subordinated to an independent disease-related pattern. Network functionality was assessed by quantifying metabolic RSN expression in cerebral blood flow PET scans acquired at rest and during task performance.

Fibrous sheath interacting protein 1 (FSIP1) is a cancer antigen expressed in the majority of TNBCs and is associated with poor prognosis. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. (Show more)"

Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We found that the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning becomes steeper as temperatures deviate from ambient conditions, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This result is driven by two processes linked to the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. First, more diverse communities have a greater chance of including species with thermal traits that enable them to maintain productivity as temperatures shift from ambient conditions. Second, we found a pronounced increase in the contribution of complementarity to the net biodiversity effect at high and low temperatures, indicating that changes in species interactions played a critical role in mediating the impacts of temperature change on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. This is a major finding for the conservation of biodiversity and the sustainability of ecosystems."

Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner.

Our work establishes the feasibility of delivering biomolecules to plants with DNA nanostructures and both details the design parameters of importance for plant cell internalization and also assesses the impact of DNA nanostructure geometry for gene silencing mechanisms. This work provides a platform for the delivery of biomolecules to plants and opens up the possibility of developing plant-based therapeutics. (Show more)"

However, decades of monitoring and regulatory efforts have focused almost exclusively on the largest watersheds, despite the fact that small tributaries are the most numerous and ubiquitous. We show that the 6 largest tributaries of Lake Michigan account for nearly 70% of the daily nutrient loads delivered to the lake, but that nutrient loads from small tributaries are high for their size and biased toward dissolved inorganic forms. These findings suggest that small watersheds may play a greater role in driving coastal eutrophication than previously appreciated. Our results highlight the importance of small watersheds in the Anthropocene and the need to address nutrient management in these areas."

In this article, we study the dynamics of a simple chemical network that is exposed to an environment that makes strong thermodynamic forcing available only to rare combinations of chemical concentrations. We find that the long-time dynamics of such systems are biased toward states that exhibit a fine-tuned extremization of environmental forcing. Our results suggest that the environment may play a more important role in the dynamics of chemical networks than previously thought. They also provide a framework for the design of synthetic chemical systems that can absorb work from their environment and convert it into chemical energy. This work may have implications for the design of synthetic chemical systems that can absorb work from their environment and convert it into chemical energy."

Here we show that NMDAR-Ab–related changes in cortical microcircuitry can lead to paroxysmal EEG abnormalities. We validate a dynamic causal model of NMDAR-Ab effects on cortical microcircuitry and use this model to identify the key synaptic parameters that best explain EEG paroxysms in pediatric patients with NMDAR-Ab encephalitis. Finally, we show that NMDAR-Ab–related changes render microcircuitry critically susceptible to overt EEG paroxysms when these key parameters are changed, even though the same parameter fluctuations are tolerated in the in silico model of the control condition. These findings offer mechanistic insights into circuit-level dysfunction induced by NMDAR-Ab. They also suggest that the same mechanisms that underlie the paroxysmal EEG abnormalities in NMDAR-Ab encephalitis may underlie other forms of epilepsy. This may have important implications for the treatment of epilepsy. (PsycINFO Database Record"

We present a case study of an abrupt warming event that occurred during a paleo-glacial state and was accompanied by a global C perturbation. We show that the warming event was accompanied by an injection of organic matter–derived C and anoxia, which were linked to a reduction in biodiversity. Earth system modeling indicates that the warming event was linked to enhanced nutrient fluxes and thermocline stratification. Our results highlight the importance of organic matter inputs and anoxia in the response of the Earth system to abrupt warming. They also highlight the potential for the Earth system to respond in a complex manner to rapid warming, which may have implications for our ability to predict the response to anthropogenic warming."

Despite its popularity, the impact of RSPO certification on deforestation has not been quantified. We use a unique dataset of oil palm plantations in Indonesia to show that RSPO certification reduced deforestation by 33% from a counterfactual of 9.8 to 6.6% y−1. However, certification had no causal impact on deforestation in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results highlight the importance of rigorous monitoring and verification of certification claims. We also show that certification is not a panacea for tropical deforestation and that it is not a substitute for strong national policies and international commitments to reduce deforestation. Our findings suggest that the RSPO is not yet delivering on its promise to reduce tropical deforestation."

In humans, its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. The exocyst complex is composed of 10 subunits, and the function of each subunit is not fully understood. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

In vertebrates, sex is determined by a single locus, resulting in two sexes. In species with multiple sex determination alleles, however, sex determination is polygenic, resulting in multiple possible genotypes for sex. Here we investigate the effects of polygenic sex determination in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii, where two female- and two male-determining alleles interact to produce four possible sexes. We find that polygenic sex determination results in modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics, including genital morphology, craniofacial morphology, gastrointestinal morphology, and home tank behaviors. These results provide context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations."

We show that the intracellular levels of iron impact the retina. We also show that the Fe chelator deferiprone decreases the oxidation and degradation of the bisretinoid A2E in the presence of light and protects retinal pigment epithelial cells from light-induced damage. These findings suggest that Fe levels impact the retina and that Fe chelation may be a useful strategy for the treatment of retinal diseases. (show more)"

However, the evolution of specialization is often considered a dead end, as it is often associated with morphological and functional changes throughout the organism. In this study, we show that specialization can evolve in a modular way, and that it is associated with specific morphological changes in the tentacles of siphonophores. Our results contribute to understanding how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs. They also help to build a broader perspective on predatory niche diversification via morphological innovation and evolution."

This fossil provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of this key derived feature and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato.

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants."
