It has also been the subject of intense philosophical scrutiny. In this paper, we provide a purely categorical characterization of the mathematical structure of quantum theory. The axioms are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. This is a significant advance over previous attempts to characterize quantum theory, which have presupposed some form of analysis. The categorical characterization is also more general than previous ones, in that it applies to a much larger class of theories."

Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species and a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. Sperm cells are quiescent in the male reproductive system due to Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1 channels, but become active once introduced into the low-Zn2+-concentration environment of the female reproductive tract. How Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide"

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant species of wild and domestic LMH in semiarid African savanna. Our results show that, even among closely related species, diet composition differs, and that diet overlap is greatest between species that are similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. These findings suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results also highlight the need for more comprehensive, species-level diet analyses to understand the role of LMH in African savanna ecosystems."

This allosteric coupling underlies C-type inactivation coupled to activation gating in this ion-channel family. We have identified the second Threonine residue within the TTVGYGD signature sequence of K+ channels as a crucial residue for this allosteric communication. A Threonine to Alanine substitution at this position was studied in three representative members of the K+-channel family. Interestingly, all of the mutant channels exhibited lack of C-type inactivation gating and an inversion of their allosteric coupling (i.e., closing of the activation gate collapses the channel’s selectivity filter). A state-dependent crystallographic study of KcsA-T75A proves that, on activation, the selectivity filter transitions from a nonconductive and deep C-type inactivated conformation to a conductive one. Finally, we provide a crystallographic demonstration that closed-state inactivation can be achieved by the structural collapse of the channel’s selectivity filter.

Here we show that anxiety, a personality trait that is associated with a high risk of becoming subordinate, directly influences social dominance in male outbred rats and identify an important mediating role for mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens. High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low-anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as decreased ATP and increased ROS production in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals.

We demonstrate that IGF2BP1 is a key regulator of the hemoglobin expression pattern in human erythroid cells. IGF2BP1 silencing results in a reversal of the adult hemoglobin expression pattern toward a more fetal-like phenotype.

The most common drugs for treating hypertension are the L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs), which are associated with a higher risk of heart failure than other antihypertensive drugs. Our study shows that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. Our findings unravel a mechanism of LCCBs action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. This study provides a rationale for the use of LCCBs in hypertension and for the development of new drugs for treating hypertension. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The YDB site in Pennsylvania is remarkable in yielding 2- to 5-mm diameter spherules containing minerals such as suessite that form at temperatures in excess of 2000 °C.

We used a comprehensive dataset of 89 genes to estimate the timing and rates of beetle diversification, and a dataset of 154 genomes or transcriptomes to trace the evolution of genes enabling symbiont-independent digestion of plant cell walls. Phylogenomic analyses of these datasets resolved controversial beetle relationships, and we found that plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles. Moreover, corresponding (Jurassic) diversification rate increases suggest that these novel genes triggered adaptive radiations that resulted in nearly half of all living beetle species. We propose that PCWDEs enabled efficient digestion of plant tissues, including lignocellulose in cell walls, facilitating the evolution of uniquely specialized plant-feeding habits, such as leaf mining and stem and wood boring. Beetle diversity thus appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal"

The strongest genetic risk factor influencing susceptibility to AD is the APOE ε4 allele. APOE is a protein that is produced by astrocytes, a major cell type in the brain. We found that APOE is important for the function of astrocytes, which are highly phagocytic and participate in normal synapse pruning and turnover. APOE is also important for the rate of complement-mediated neurodegeneration of senescent synapses. These studies reveal a novel role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes and suggest the hypothesis that AD susceptibility of APOE4 may originate in part from defective phagocytic capacity of astrocytes which accelerates the rate of accumulation of senescent synapses, enhancing synaptic vulnerability to classical-complement-cascade mediated neurodegeneration. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that APOE4 is associated with a higher rate of neurodegeneration in AD patients. These studies also provide a potential mechanism for the beneficial effect of the APOE ε2 allele on AD risk."

The inner core is thought to have formed by the crystallization of molten iron. However, the nucleation mechanism of the stable, hexagonal close-packed phase of iron, which is the main component of the inner core, has not been well understood. We demonstrate that the nucleation of the stable phase is not the first step of the inner core formation, but rather the bcc phase, which is metastable, has a much higher nucleation rate than does the hcp phase. This mechanism reduces the required undercooling of iron nucleation, which provides a key factor in solving the inner core nucleation paradox. The two-step nucleation scenario of the inner core also opens an avenue for understanding the structure and anisotropy of the present inner core.

It does so by binding to the filament and inducing its depolymerization. However, how it does so in a physiological context, where filaments are interconnected and under mechanical stress, remains unclear. Here, we monitor and quantify the action of ADF in different mechanical situations by using single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques, coupled to microfluidics. We find that local curvature favors severing, while tension surprisingly has no effect on ADF binding and weakly enhances severing. Remarkably, we observe that filament segments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist, experience a mechanical torque upon ADF binding. We find that this ADF-induced torque does not hinder ADF binding, but dramatically enhances severing. A simple model, which faithfully recapitulates our experimental observations, indicates that the ADF-induced torque increases the severing rate constant 100-fold. A consequence of this mechanism is that cross-linked filament networks are severed by cofilin far more efficiently than nonconnected filaments. We propose that this mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF’s ability"

The distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population.

Progress on understanding ACI processes is hampered by inadequate observational capability. This study introduces a new technique, the dual-field-of-view high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL), to investigate ACI. The HSRL is capable of simultaneously profiling aerosol and water cloud properties, especially water cloud microphysical properties. The HSRL was used to conduct continuous observations of aerosols and clouds over Beijing, China, to investigate the interactions between aerosol loading and water cloud microphysical properties. The observations show that the aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI.

The isotopic record of the oceans, however, has been subject to question due to uncertainties regarding oceanic isotopic compositions, diagenetic or metamorphic resetting of the isotopic record, and depositional environments. We here present thermostability measurements of reconstructed ancestral enzymes derived from light-requiring prokaryotic and eukaryotic phototrophs having widely separated fossil-based divergence ages. The ancestral environmental temperatures thereby determined for these photic-zone organisms––shown in modern taxa to correlate strongly with NDK thermostability––are inferred to reflect ancient surface-environment paleotemperatures. Our results suggest that Earth's surface temperature decreased over geological time from ∼65–80 °C in the Archean, a finding consistent both with previous isotope-based and protein reconstruction-based interpretations.

They are also the targets of drugs and toxins. Ion channels are classified into three types based on their structure and function. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel is a type-3 channel that is normally open and inactivated slowly. We found that the BK channel has two pore gates, one for fast activation/deactivation and the other for slow inactivation/recovery. We also found that the BK channel’s inactivation is state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because BK channel inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of inactivation. These findings provide a new perspective on the regulation of ion channels. They also provide a theoretical basis for the development of drugs and toxins that target ion channels.

Here, we show that housing mice in low humidity increases susceptibility to severe disease following influenza challenge. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in mice deficient in caspase-1/11, an enzyme involved in the antiviral response. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

Our results provide initial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases.

Our findings also suggest that bats may be a reservoir of other emerging coronaviruses that can infect humans. This study provides insights into the molecular basis of MERS-CoV transmission to humans and the origin of other bat coronaviruses. It also provides a framework for understanding the evolution of host range and cell entry activity of emerging coronaviruses. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

We identified a variety of vector-borne, zoonotic, and emerging pathogens, including chikungunya virus, which presaged a national outbreak. Pathogen-agnostic mNGS investigation of febrile persons in resource-scarce Southeast Asia is feasible and revealing of a diverse pathogen landscape. Coordinated and ongoing mNGS pathogen surveillance can better identify the breadth of endemic, zoonotic, or emerging pathogens and deployment of rapid public health response. This approach can be applied to other resource-scarce settings to better understand the pathogen landscape and mitigate the impact of emerging epidemics. (Show more)"

First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology.

This potentially reduces warming by up to 0.11 °C by 2100.

However, the mechanisms that regulate the timing and quantity of nutrient delivery are poorly understood. Here, we show that the provision of a single glycan to the luminescent symbiont of a squid is precisely timed to maintain the stability of the symbiosis. This glycan is released by the host only at night, when the symbiotic organ is at its most active, and is catabolized by the symbiont only at night, when the organ is at its most acidic. This glycan-driven regulation of the symbiosis is likely to be a common mechanism used by animals to control the activities of their associated microbes."

However, the latent structure of text data is often unknown. This makes it difficult to identify patterns of interest, such as the topics that are present in a corpus. We introduce a method to identify latent patterns in text data and represent documents as topic sequences. We use a generative model to infer the topic that generated a sequence of words. We illustrate our method with a prominent example of underutilized text: the US National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). We identify 225 latent topics in the narratives of violent deaths, many of which are not captured by existing structured variables. We then compare the gender bias of topics to their prevalence in narratives of female versus male victims. Our method offers a flexible and broadly applicable approach to model topics in text data. It can be used to identify latent patterns in many domains. We believe that this will be a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners."

This pandemic is generally understood as the consequence of a singular introduction of Yersinia pestis, after which the disease established itself in European rodents over four centuries. To locate these putative plague reservoirs, we studied the climate fluctuations that preceded regional plague epidemics, based on a dataset of 7,711 georeferenced historical plague outbreaks and 15 annually resolved tree-ring records from Europe and Asia.

The distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population.

In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

We have developed a small-molecule inhibitor of the one-carbon unit-generating enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), and used it to identify a metabolic vulnerability of cancer cells. This vulnerability is rooted in the requirement of cancer cells for the import of glycine, a key amino acid that is generated from the one-carbon unit. Thus, we have identified a metabolic vulnerability of cancer cells that is rooted in the requirement of cancer cells for the import of glycine.

These proteins form characteristic intracellular inclusion bodies that are present in all forms of the disease. Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions in the brain and spinal cord are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. Rather, the inclusion bodies in ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. This metastable state is not observed in other human tissues, suggesting that the metastable state is a specific feature of motor neurons that is lost in other tissues. This study provides a mechanism for the formation of inclusion bodies in ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases. It also suggests that the metastable state may be a general feature of proteins that are prone to aggregation. This may have implications for the design of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. (Show more)"

The device configuration also enables application of optical tweezers for controlled placement of atoms. Devices can be fabricated reliably from a 200-nm silicon nitride device layer using a lithography-based process, producing predicted optical properties in transmission and reflection measurements.

Our findings suggest that inhibition of YAP/TAZ activation is a promising strategy for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis. This study also provides a mechanistic understanding of the functional role of YAP/TAZ in the regulation of vascular homeostasis and atherogenesis.

However, the frequency and extent of wildfire in the United States has increased substantially in recent decades, and is projected to continue to increase in the future. This increase is likely due to a combination of factors, including climate change, but the direct role of people in increasing wildfire activity has been largely overlooked. We show that humans have vastly expanded the spatial and seasonal “fire niche” in the United States, accounting for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. Our results highlight the importance of human-caused wildfires and the need for increased management of these fires to reduce fire risk."

We connect changes in the physical appearance of five US cities with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities."

We also found that treatment of mice bearing breast cancer patient-derived xenografts with the humanized anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab repressed expression of genes associated with breast cancer stemness, reduced activation of Rho-GTPases, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, or BMI1, and impaired the capacity of breast cancer PDXs to metastasize or reengraft Rag2−/−γc−/− mice. Finally, treatment of PDX-bearing mice with cirmtuzumab and paclitaxel was more effective than treatment with either alone in eradicating breast cancer PDXs.

But how do we know when two people are connected to each other? We asked people to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"

SAN cells (SANCs) are responsible for the generation of the heartbeat and are characterized by their unique electrophysiological properties. SANCs are the only cells in the heart that have a high content of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ stores and are the only cells in the heart that are able to release Ca2+ into the cytoplasm. Here, we report that stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is a multifunctional regulator of Ca2+ dynamics in SANCs that links SR Ca2+ store content with electrical events occurring in the plasma membrane, thereby contributing to automaticity of the SAN. This study reveals a previously unknown role for STIM1 in the heart and provides a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmia. (Show more)"

Here we propose a mechanism that supports memory in the brain. Information is stored in the form of changes in the excitability of neurons. These changes are adaptive, meaning that they are dependent on the current state of the system. This mechanism is sensitive to context and serial order, and it can be used to bind information over time. This is a significant advance in our understanding of the brain, as it suggests that memory is not a fixed property of the nervous system, but rather a dynamic process that can be modulated by experience.

However, the delivery of biomolecules to plants is a major challenge. This is due to the cell wall, which is absent in mammalian cells and poses the dominant physical barrier to biomolecule delivery in plants. Herein, we report a systematic assessment of different DNA nanostructures for their ability to internalize into cells of mature plants, deliver siRNAs, and effectively silence a constitutively expressed gene in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. We show that the internalization efficiency of DNA nanostructures correlates with their respective gene silencing efficiencies but that the endogenous gene silencing pathway depends on the siRNA attachment locus. Our work establishes the feasibility of biomolecule delivery to plants with DNA nanostructures and both details the design parameters of importance for plant cell internalization and also assesses the impact of DNA nanostructure geometry for gene silencing mechanisms. This work is expected to be of interest to the scientific community working on the delivery of biomolecules to plants. It also provides a platform for the development of DNA nanostructures for the delivery of biomolecules to plants and other organisms."

We found that the 6 largest of 235 tributaries accounted for ∼70% of the daily N and P delivered to Lake Michigan. However, small watersheds exhibited nutrient loads that were high for their size and biased toward dissolved inorganic forms. This suggests that small watersheds may play a greater role in fueling coastal algal blooms than previously thought. Our findings highlight the importance of small watersheds in driving coastal nutrient inputs and the need to expand nutrient management efforts to these areas."

We also show that the total weight of modern farm vehicles is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods. We hypothesize that the roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the largest sauropods, the brachiosaurs, had the largest footprints, suggesting that they may have used them to avoid compaction.
