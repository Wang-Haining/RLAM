The structure of neon hydrate is also stable at 100 MPa and 70 K, which is the lowest temperature studied in this work.

In this paper, we provide a purely categorical description of quantum theory, in which states and operations are not needed. Instead, we use a notion of morphism between Hilbert spaces. This description is based on a set of axioms that are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. The axioms are designed to be as general as possible, and we show that they are satisfied by the category of Hilbert spaces and bounded linear operators, the category of von Neumann algebras and representations, and many other categories of interest in quantum theory."

Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. To understand the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite, we compared the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species to the genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This transition may have been facilitated by the loss of signaling pathways and transcriptional factors important for multicellular development. These results provide insights into the evolution of the Myxozoa and the origin of parasitism. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2 in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes. We found that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 evades the host antiviral response and may provide a target for the development of new therapeutic strategies. (Show more)"

In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

However, the impact of heat on crop yields depends on the temperature at which the crop is grown. We show that the variability of maize yields will increase substantially as the global mean temperature increases, and that this variability will be much larger than the variability of climate. This will increase the probability of simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year in the world’s major maize-exporting countries. Our results highlight the need for investments in breeding maize varieties that are more heat tolerant. This will help to ensure food security in the future."

However, despite decades of research, we still do not know how diverse LMH assemblages coexist. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant LMH species in semiarid African savanna. Our results show that LMH are highly specialized and that diet composition differs between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Our results highlight the need for a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms by which LMH partition food resources. This will be critical for predicting the consequences of anthropogenic changes in LMH populations and their impact on biodiversity in a changing world."

However, the global load of plastic debris on the open ocean surface is still unknown. Using data from the Malaspina 2010 circumnavigation, regional surveys, and previously published reports, we show a worldwide distribution of plastic on the surface of the open ocean, mostly accumulating in the convergence zones of each of the five subtropical gyres with comparable density. However, the global load of plastic on the open ocean surface was estimated to be on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This discrepancy is explained by the size distribution of floating plastic debris, which points at important size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

We find that the greatest increase in reproductive output is in species that practice allonursing, or the provision of food to offspring after birth. This suggests that the ultimate factor limiting reproductive output in placental mammals is maternal metabolic power rather than resource availability. This is an important finding because it suggests that the evolution of reproductive output is not a simple function of resource availability. It also suggests that the evolution of domestication and all forms of allocare may be more important in increasing reproductive output than previously thought. This is an important finding for understanding the evolution of animal behavior and the evolution of the human species. (Show more)"

The disease is characterized by the accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregates in affected oligodendrocytes. Several studies point to α-syn oligomerization and aggregation as a mediator of neurotoxicity in synucleinopathies including MSA. We present here an in vivo proof of concept of the ability of the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 to mitigate α-syn pathology and to mediate neuroprotection in a mouse model of MSA. VX-765 was able to reduce truncated α-syn, its monomeric and oligomeric forms, and to preserve tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in the substantia nigra.

It controls vascular contractility, hemostasis, and inflammation and regulates the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products between circulating blood and tissue. To control each function, the endothelium processes endlessly arriving requests from multiple sources using separate clusters of cells specialized to detect specific stimuli. A well-developed but poorly understood communication system operates between cells to integrate multiple lines of information and coordinate endothelial responses. Here, the nature of the communication network has been addressed using single-cell Ca2+ imaging across thousands of endothelial cells in intact blood vessels.

We provide evidence that the low probability to become dominant in high-anxious animals is due to reduced mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens is crucial for social behavior and that it is critically involved in the low social competitiveness associated with high anxiety.

The synthesized structures are manufactured via multimaterial fabrication and heteroassembly. The structures exhibit complex shapes and motions with irregular material distributions. Within the structures, different materials play distinct roles yet seamlessly collaborate through sophisticated deformation mechanisms to produce the target behaviors. The proposed strategy can be utilized to design function-oriented and situation-specific mechanical devices for a wide range of applications. It can also be extended to design structures with complex behaviors, such as self-healing, self-assembly, and self-regulation.

The hemoglobin expression pattern in human erythroblasts is regulated by a complex network of transcription factors and miRNAs. Here we investigated the role of insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) in the heterochronic regulation of hemoglobin expression. IGF2BP1 is a downstream element of the let-7 miRNA pathway. We show that IGF2BP1 is developmentally silenced in human erythroblasts and that overexpression of IGF2BP1 in erythroid cells causes a nearly complete reversal of the adult hemoglobin expression pattern toward a more fetal-like phenotype. This phenotype is achieved by increased gamma-globin expression and decreased beta-globin expression. The fetal hemoglobin achieved levels of 68.6 ± 3.9% in the IGF2BP1 overexpression samples compared with 5.0 ± 1.8% in donor matched transduction controls.

We also found that the activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway protects cancer cells from oxidative stress through the induction of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a key enzyme in lipid metabolism. In addition, we demonstrated that the combination of ferroptosis induction and mTORC1 inhibition is effective in preclinical models of cancer.

The major drug class for treating hypertension is L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs). LCCBs are widely used in the clinic, but the mechanisms of their action on Ca2+ signaling and vascular remodeling are not well understood. Here, we show that LCCBs activate Ca2+ signaling through STIM/ORAI proteins. Our data indicate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. Our findings provide a mechanism of LCCB action on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrate that LCCBs promote vascular remodeling through STIM-mediated activation of ORAI. Our data indicate caution against the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with advanced hypertension and/or onset of cardiovascular remodeling, where levels of STIM and ORAI are elevated. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the role of LCCBs in vascular remodeling and may lead to the development of new strategies for treating hypertension.

This failure is partly due to the continued decline of older forests on private lands, where clearcutting is still common. The NWFP is a unique opportunity to evaluate the influence of policy. Our findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure. This will require a shift in forest management practices to emphasize the development of older forests. Such a shift will require a change in the way we think about forests."

We used a comprehensive dataset of 89 genes to estimate the diversification rates of all major lineages of beetles, and a dataset of 154 genomes or transcriptomes to trace the evolution of genes enabling symbiont-independent digestion of lignocellulose. Phylogenomic analyses of these datasets resolved controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, corresponding (Jurassic) diversification rate increases suggest that these novel genes triggered adaptive radiations that resulted in nearly half of all living beetle species. We propose that these horizontal transfers of microbial genes enabled efficient digestion of plant tissues, including lignocellulose in cell walls, facilitating the evolution of uniquely specialized plant-feeding habits, such as leaf mining and stem and wood boring. Beetle diversity thus appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial"

The presence of two copies of the E4 allele increases risk by ∼12-fold whereas E2 allele is associated with an ∼twofold decreased risk for AD. These data put APOE central to AD pathophysiology, but it is not yet clear how APOE alleles modify AD risk. Here, we report a novel role for APOE in controlling the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes. They also suggest the hypothesis that APOE4 may accelerate AD pathogenesis by increasing the rate of accumulation of senescent synapses. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that APOE4 is associated with increased C1q protein accumulation in the hippocampus.

The Second Pandemic (14–19th centuries) is characterized by high mortality and recurrent epidemics, which led to the loss of millions of lives. The vector of plague during the Second Pandemic is still debated, with the most common hypothesis being that rats were the main transmission pathway. Here, we present a mathematical model for plague transmission by a human ectoparasite vector. We show that this model fits mortality curves from nine outbreaks better than models for pneumonic or rodent transmission. Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346–1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats. This work may help to improve our understanding of the history of plague in Europe. (Show more)"

However, the evolution of brain neuronal density is still poorly understood. We present a comprehensive dataset of neuron numbers in amniotes and use it to reconstruct the evolution of brain neuronal density. We show that reptiles have not only small brains relative to body size but also low neuronal densities, resulting in average neuron numbers over 20 times lower than those in birds and mammals of similar body size. This has important implications for studies using relative brain size as a proxy when looking for evolutionary drivers of animal cognition."

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal and transformed cells is more complex than previously appreciated. We have shown that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This study provides a mechanistic explanation for the observed inverse correlation between TRAP1 expression and tumor grade in several cancers. It also suggests that TRAP1 may be a useful target for cancer therapy.

These proteins are important regulators of cell shape and motility, and they are also involved in a variety of diseases. The proteins of this family are small, and they are thought to bind to actin filaments and depolymerize them. However, how they do so in a physiological context, where filaments are interconnected and under mechanical stress, remains unclear. Here, we use single-molecule and single-filament techniques to study the action of these proteins in different mechanical situations. We find that the proteins bind to filaments and depolymerize them more efficiently in situations that favor filament twisting. We propose that this mechanism is critical to boost the ability of these proteins to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. This mechanochemical mechanism is likely to be common in other proteins that depolymerize actin filaments."

We used a grid-based approach to sample the genomic diversity across Madagascar, from the north to the south, from the east to the west. We find that Madagascar is a mosaic of genetic ancestries, with a common Bantu and Austronesian descent for all Malagasy individuals. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. This study provides a comprehensive view of the genomic diversity of Madagascar, which is a unique case study for understanding the settlement history of the island.

We show that this peptide is highly effective against multiple plant fungal pathogens, including Botrytis cinerea and three Fusarium spp. It binds to multiple bioactive phosphoinositides in vitro and induces reactive oxygen species in germlings of the fungal pathogen. The peptide also exhibits a unique mode of action, which involves penetration of the fungal cell wall and subsequent accumulation in the cytoplasm and nucleoli of germlings. This study provides a basis for the development of this class of peptides as a spray-on fungistat/fungicide. This is the first report of a plant-derived peptide with such a mode of action.

We find that low humidity impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in mice deficient in caspase-1/11, an enzyme involved in host defense against influenza virus infection. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

This hierarchical structure is consistent with a bottom-up or left-corner parser of the incoming language stream. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for the neurophysiological reality of the merge operation postulated by linguists and suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases.

One such strategy is to engineer nitrogen fixation in cereal crops, which would allow for the delivery of nitrogen in a form that is readily available to the plant. However, the development of such a strategy is complicated by the fact that the nitrogenase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of N2 to a form that can be used by plants, is highly sensitive to environmental cues. Here, we demonstrate the development of a synthetic plant-controlled nitrogen fixation system, in which the nitrogenase is only activated when in contact with the desired host plant.

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, HM predicted support for Trump in the days (Studies 1 and 2) and months (Studies 3 through 6) following the 2016 election. HM was also associated with less trust in the government, more sexism, more racism, and more xenophobia. In contrast, social and prejudiced attitudes predicted evaluations of the democratic candidates. These findings highlight the importance of psychological examinations of masculinity as a cultural ideology to understand how men’s and women’s endorsement of HM legitimizes patriarchal dominance and reinforces gender, race, and class-based hierarchies via candidate support. They also provide a framework for understanding the role of masculinity in the 2020 American presidential election. The findings have implications for understanding the role of masculinity in the political and social lives of men and women."

We demonstrate that the adoption of diverse, rotationally grazed pastures can increase soil C storage by 18 to 29% over 29 y of management. This is a significant contribution to the global effort to mitigate climate change and highlights the potential of grasslands to play a key role in climate-smart agriculture."

One of the main rewards plants offer to pollinators for visitation is nectar. Nesocodon mauritianus (Campanulaceae) produces a blood-red nectar that has been proposed to serve as a visual attractant for pollinator visitation. Here, we show that the nectar’s red color is derived from a previously undescribed alkaloid termed nesocodin. We identify a convergently evolved trait in two vertebrate-pollinated species, suggesting that the red pigment is selectively favored and that only a limited number of compounds are likely to underlie this type of adaptation.

We find that the genetic ancestry of men is mostly consistent with that of modern northern and central Europeans, while women exhibit a very high genetic heterogeneity; this includes signals of genetic ancestry ranging from western Europe to East Asia. In addition, we found that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago.

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. First, whereas MERS-CoV prefers human DPP4 over bat DPP4 as its receptor, HKU4 shows the opposite trend. Second, in the absence of exogenous proteases, both MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes mediate pseudovirus entry into bat cells, whereas only MERS-CoV spike, but not HKU4 spike, mediates pseudovirus entry into human cells.

We used a cloud-based metagenomic sequencing platform to investigate the pathogen landscape of undifferentiated febrile illness in Cambodia. We identified a variety of vector-borne, zoonotic, and emerging pathogens, including chikungunya virus, which was detected in a patient before the national outbreak.

The stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. In S. cerevisiae, the extreme stability of the pol δ holoenzyme ensures that every nucleobase within an Okazaki fragment is faithfully duplicated before dissociation but also necessitates an active displacement mechanism for polymerase recycling and exchange. In humans, the pol δ holoenzyme is remarkably stable, but the implications of this stability on lagging strand replication are unknown. We developed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. Our results indicate that human pol δ maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This behavior is unique to humans and likely contributes to the higher mutation rate of humans compared to S. cerevisiae.

The parchment used to make these books was made from the skin of animals, and the source of this animal skin has been a long-standing controversy. We report a simple and objective method for identifying the animal origin of parchment. This method is based on the use of a PVC eraser to extract protein from the parchment surface, followed by peptide mass fingerprinting. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals, but did find evidence for the use of more than one species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides. This method could be used to identify the source of parchment used in other books and manuscripts. This would be of great interest to codicologists, who are interested in the source of parchment used in the production of early printed books. (Show more)"

Understanding the extinction requires an accurate and precise age model. The age model for the extinction is currently based on a single U-Pb date for a volcanic ash bed. We present five U-Pb dates for volcanic ash beds from the Global Stratotype Section and Point for the Permian-Triassic boundary at Meishan, China. The new dates define an extinction age of 251.941 ± 0.037 and 251.880 ± 0.031 Mya, an interval of 60 ± 48 ka. The extinction is followed by a period of rapid carbon cycle reorganization, punctuated by short-lived negative spikes in the isotopic composition of carbonate carbon. The carbon cycle volatility persists for ∼500 ka before a return to near preextinction values. The new dates provide a refined evaluation of the relative roles of rate-dependent processes contributing to the extinction, allowing insight into postextinction ecosystem expansion. The dates also provide a precise time point for evaluating the plausibility of trigger and kill mechanisms. The"

This has led to a reduction in fire activity, which has offset some of the warming caused by human emissions. However, climate change is still expected to cause more warming than would otherwise occur, and the risk of more extreme fires is also increasing. Our results highlight the importance of fire in the global carbon cycle and the need to manage fire in a more integrated way with climate change."

This pandemic is generally understood as the consequence of a singular introduction of Yersinia pestis, after which the disease established itself in European rodents over four centuries. To locate these putative plague reservoirs, we studied the climate fluctuations that preceded regional plague epidemics, based on a dataset of 7,711 georeferenced historical plague outbreaks and 15 annually resolved tree-ring records from Europe and Asia.

There is an urgent need for novel and more efficient therapies, ideally targeting AML stem cells that are essential for maintaining the disease. We show here that monoclonal antibodies targeting the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This study provides a proof-of-concept for the use of antibodies targeting IL1RAP as a treatment for AML. This"

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

We propose a new approach that uses the vast network of crop experts that are part of the US Department of Agriculture’s Crop Progress and Condition survey to provide a continuous and probabilistic measure of crop status. This approach is based on the idea that the subjective crop status reported by individual experts is a more accurate representation of crop status than objective models or satellite imagery. We demonstrate that this approach can provide earlier and more accurate predictions of crop yields than official forecasts released midseason. Our approach can be easily extended to other crops and countries, and can be used to monitor the status of other agricultural products such as livestock, fisheries, and forestry."

The discovery of this material, which is the oldest anthropogenic quasicrystal currently known, demonstrates that quasicrystalline structures can be formed under conditions that are not associated with meteorite impacts. This discovery also provides a unique link between the history of the 20th century and the structure of matter. (Show more)"

Photosynthesis relies on these modified tetrapyrroles for the capture of solar radiation and its conversion to chemical energy. The formation of the isocyclic fifth ring, the presence of which is unique to (bacterio)chlorophylls, has remained a mystery for more than 60 y. This reaction is catalyzed by two unrelated enzymes using different chemistries. The majority of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria use a [4Fe-4S] cluster protein, whereas plants, cyanobacteria, and some phototrophic bacteria possess a diiron enzyme. Plant and cyanobacterial mutants in ycf54 display impaired function of the diiron enzyme, accumulating the reaction substrate. Swapping cyclases between cyanobacteria and purple phototrophic bacteria reveals three classes of the diiron enzyme. A diiron enzyme in Rubrivivax gelatinosus is required for growth, whereas alphaproteobacterial cyclases require a newly discovered protein that we term BciE, encoded by a gene conserved in these organisms.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral inflexibility in autism and may facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies. This article is protected by copyright.

However, the factors that contribute to virus spillover from bats are not well understood. Here, we identified and characterized an immunosuppressant protein (MTX) that is highly concentrated in the submandibular salivary gland of the bat, Myotis pilosus. MTX selectively inhibits the epoxide hydrolase function of leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) to inhibit LTB4 generation and the generation of LTB4-dependent host defense against infection. MTX potently inhibited proinflammatory proteases to induce immune tolerance and maintain high stability. In mouse models, influenza A virus (IAV) H1N1 infection and pathogenicity were exacerbated by MTX but were reversed by interfering with the effects of MTX on LTA4H or exogenous LTB4 administration.

To better understand how sequential proteolysis contributes to MERS-CoV infection, we introduced mutations that blocked the first S protein cleavage events. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past cell-surface proteases and into endosomes, whereas precleaved MERS viruses used endosomal proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry. Uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that"

We find that the surfaceome is highly variable among the cells, and that each oncogene has a distinct surfaceome. However, the surfaceome is harmonized by common biological themes including up-regulation of nutrient transporters, down-regulation of adhesion molecules, and alteration in immune modulators. These studies provide a systems-level view of how oncogenes remodel the surfaceome and the glycoproteome in a cell autologous fashion, and suggest possible surface targets and combinations thereof, for drug and biomarker discovery.

Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus using in vitro experiments. We demonstrated that this interaction takes place in infected cells and is required for optimal viral replication. Disruption of this interaction did not affect the HA titer of the mutant viruses, suggesting that the same amount of viral particles was produced.

In turn, the dysbiotic microbiome triggers a regenerative response and stimulates tumor growth. We find that inhibiting JNK signaling or depletion of the microbiome restores barrier function of the intestinal epithelium, leading to a reestablishment of host–microbe homeostasis, and organismic lifespan extension.

We also show that freshwater fisheries provide the equivalent of all dietary animal protein for 158 million people, and that poor and undernourished populations are particularly reliant on inland fisheries compared with marine or aquaculture sources. Our data can be used to identify regions where fisheries are a high priority for conservation and management, and where alternative sources of protein are scarce. This highlights the critical role of rivers and lakes in providing locally sourced, low-cost protein, and underscores the high stakes for improving fishery management. Our map of global riverine fisheries can be used to facilitate the inclusion of inland fisheries in environmental planning to protect both food security and species diversity. (Show more)"

Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. (Show more)"

However, these factors are most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects of biodiversity loss and environmental warming on ecosystem functioning. Here we show that changes in temperature systematically alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures depart from ambient conditions, the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increases, meaning that more species are required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. This is a fundamental insight into the impacts of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. It has implications for the design of conservation and management strategies.

To understand the potential for future abrupt climate change, it is important to understand the processes that led to the past abrupt climate change. Here, we present a case study of an abrupt climate change that occurred ∼304 Ma, which is also unprecedented in the last 2 million y. We show that the climate change was driven by a global warming event that was superimposed on a longer-term greenhouse climate state. The warming event was linked to an injection of organic matter–derived carbon into the ocean, which led to anoxia and a biodiversity nadir. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the processes that led to past abrupt climate change to better understand the potential for future abrupt climate change. (Show more)"

Certification is the primary tool used by major corporations and countries to reduce this impact. However, the impact of certification on deforestation has been unclear. We show that certification is associated with reduced deforestation in Indonesia. Nevertheless, certification had no causal impact on deforestation in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation. Our results highlight the need for certification to be tightly regulated and for certification to be combined with other conservation and climate mitigation policies. This is particularly important in Indonesia, where the government has recently relaxed regulations on palm oil production.

It is essential for the formation of the fusion pore and the release of the cargo from the trans-Golgi network. The exocyst complex is evolutionarily conserved from bacteria to humans. Dysfunction of the exocyst complex is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. We discovered a small molecule that inhibits the exocyst complex and provides a valuable tool for studying the regulation of the exocyst complex. This study also offers a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

In vertebrates, sex is determined by a single locus, resulting in two sexes. In species with multiple sex determination alleles, however, sex determination is polygenic, and the number of sexes can vary. Here we investigate the effects of polygenic sex determination on secondary sexual characteristics in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii. We find that polygenic sex determination results in modular variation in secondary sexual characteristics, including genital morphology, craniofacial morphology, gastrointestinal morphology, and home tank behaviors. These results provide context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of the maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations. Understanding the evolutionary consequences of sex determination is critical for understanding the diversity of sex in the animal kingdom. (Show more)"

The photoreceptor-generated ROS are quenched by the RPE, but the ROS generated by the RPE can damage photoreceptors. We sought to understand how Fe levels impact the retina, given that retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are also challenged by accumulations of vitamin A aldehyde adducts (bisretinoid lipofuscin) that photogenerate reactive oxygen species and photodecompose into damaging aldehyde- and dicarbonyl-bearing species. We found that intracellular Fe promotes bisretinoid oxidation and degradation. This interpretation was supported by experiments showing that Fe chelation decreased the oxidative/degradation of the bisretinoid A2E in the presence of light and reduced cell death in cell-based experiments. Moreover, light-independent oxidation and degradation of A2E by Fenton chemistry products were evidenced by the consumption of A2E, release of dicarbonyls, and generation of oxidized A2E species in cell-free assays. These findings indicate that Fe is a key factor in the oxidation and degradation of bisretinoids in the"

However, the evolution of predator specialization is often considered a dead end. We show that siphonophores, a group of pelagic predators, can evolve into generalists and that specialists on one prey type can evolve into specialists on other prey types. These findings help us understand how specialization and morphological evolution have shaped present-day food webs. They also provide a new perspective on the evolution of predator morphology, which is fundamental to understanding how organisms interact with their environment."

The fossil record for the evolution of the human hand is fragmentary, however, and there is a gap in the fossil record between 800,000 and 1.8 My old. This gap is well documented for the evolution of stone tool technology, but the reasons for the lack of change in the hand are not well understood. Here we report the discovery of a hand fossil from East Africa that shows a key derived feature of the human hand, the third metacarpal styloid process, which is absent in early hominins. This fossil provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of this key derived feature of the human hand. This finding suggests that the evolution of the human hand may have been more rapid than previously thought. (Show more)"

Mammalian serine hydroxymethyltransferse (SHMT) converts serine to glycine and a tetrahydrofolate-bound one-carbon unit. In this study, we identify a small-molecule inhibitor of SHMT, which blocks colon cancer tumor growth in mice. We also identify a glycine import defect in a subset of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which is a particularly aggressive form of cancer. These findings suggest that targeting SHMT may be a promising strategy for treating cancer, and may also be useful in treating lymphoma. This study also provides a proof-of-concept for the use of small-molecule inhibitors of SHMT in cancer therapy. This approach may be useful in treating other cancers as well.

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the largest sauropods, the brachiosaurids, had the lowest"
