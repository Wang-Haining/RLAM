In this work, we report the structure of ice II hydrate, which is a new phase of water. We show that neon, a noble gas, can be enclathrated in water molecules to form ice II-structured hydrates. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. The resolved structure where Ne dissolved in ice II is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. Our results provide a new perspective on the structure of ice II and its hydrate. They also provide a new material for studying the properties of water under high pressure. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Our results provide insights into the evolution of parasitic lifestyles and the origin of the Myxozoa. (Show more)"

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to block the nuclear import of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in order to impair their transcriptional induction. We found that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade the host immune response and may help in the development of new strategies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of these channels. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of the proton channel. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits the channel will further our understanding of the channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for the channel.

However, the magnitude of the yield reduction is uncertain because of the lack of data on the relationship between temperature and crop yield. We use global datasets of maize production and climate variability combined with future temperature projections to quantify how yield variability will change in the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. Our results show that the probability of simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year increases from virtually zero to 7% under 2 °C warming and to 86% under 4 °C warming. These results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the 800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes.

We found that the extent of diet overlap was greater between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption than between species that were dissimilar in these ways. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammal assemblages.

However, the global load of floating plastic debris is still unknown. We show that the plastic debris load on the open ocean surface is far less than expected. This is due to the size-selective sinks of floating plastic debris, which are mostly related to the fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller. This sink may involve a combination of fast fragmentation, transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."

However, the policy failed to halt the decline of older-forest–associated bird populations, which are now accelerating. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure. The NWFP is a model for how science can be used to inform policy for biodiversity conservation. We hope that this study will help to ensure that the NWFP continues to be effective in the future.

This problem can be addressed by the development of new antibacterial agents to keep pace with the evolutionary adaptation of pathogens. In this study, we present a rational design approach to identify new antibiotics. We used computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome to screen acylide antibiotics. The best candidate was tested in vitro and in vivo, and showed activity against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization. Our study demonstrates the potential of computational approaches to address the challenge of antibiotic resistance. This approach can be extended to other antibiotic classes. The results of this study may contribute to the development of new antibiotics. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data. The proposed architecture is easy to implement, train, and apply in practice, and automatically adapts to different problems."

Our analyses resolved the evolutionary history of beetles and revealed that the origin of beetles and their plant-feeding habits coincide with the first appearance of genes encoding microbial enzymes that digest plant cell walls. These genes may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of beetles, which in turn may have led to the evolution of the most diverse group of animals."

However, the function of TRAP1 in normal cells has been difficult to determine because of the lack of specific inhibitors of TRAP1. We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species.

The island is located ∼400 km from the east coast of Africa, but its genetic and linguistic traits are from both regions. We used a grid-based approach to sample at high resolution the genomic diversity across Madagascar. We find that the Malagasy population is a mixture of Bantu and Austronesian populations, with a limited contribution from Europe and the Middle East. The settlement history of Madagascar is also revealed by the genomic data. We find that the settlement was recent, but the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the settlement was not homogeneous. Finally, we show that a few centuries are sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. This study provides a comprehensive view of the settlement history of Madagascar. It also provides a framework to study the human population in other island settings. (Show more)"

We found that mouse airway cells infected with mouse-adapted rhinovirus exhibit a striking enrichment in expression of antiviral defense response genes at 37 °C relative to 33 °C. This correlated with significantly higher expression levels of type I and type III IFN genes and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) at 37 °C.

However, the predominant Np4 decapping enzyme in bacteria, ApaH, is inactivated by the very conditions of disulfide stress that enable Np4 to accumulate. Here, we show that, in the presence of disulfide stress, the pyrophosphohydrolase RppH assumes a leading role in decapping Np4-capped RNAs. We also show that, unlike ApaH, RppH prefers to decape capped RNAs over their capped counterparts. This preference is due to the unconventional manner in which capped substrates bind to the active site of RppH, positioning the δ-phosphate, rather than the β-phosphate, for hydrolytic attack. The differential impact of RppH and ApaH on the rates at which capped and capped-capped RNAs are deprotected could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress.

They open and close their pore gates to allow or block ion flow. K+ channels commonly possess two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. We found that the BK channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We induced C-type inactivation in BK channels and studied the relationship between activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery. We observed prominent slow C-type inactivation/recovery in BK channels by an extreme low concentration of extracellular K+ together with a Y294E/K/Q/S or Y279F mutation whose equivalent in Shaker channels (T449E/K/D/Q/S or W434F) caused a greatly accelerated rate of C-type inactivation or constitutive C-inactivation. C-type inactivation in most K+ channels occurs upon sustained membrane depolarization or channel opening and then recovers during hyperpolarized membrane potentials or channel closure. However, we found that the BK channel C-type"

In temperate regions, seasonal influenza outbreaks are associated with decreases in ambient humidity. However, the impact of humidity on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes them more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that low humidity impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of interferon-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

However, the stability of the pol δ holoenzyme has not been measured. Here, we developed unique kinetic assays to measure the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme. We found that the pol δ holoenzyme is stable and maintains a loose association with the PCNA sliding clamp. Such behavior has profound implications for lagging strand synthesis in humans."

We connect changes in the physical appearance of five US cities with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities."

We show here that monoclonal antibodies targeting interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

While sRNAs generally are considered to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164-nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28-amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and increases dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuR). Interestingly, AzuC translation interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base-pairing functions compete.

We show that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting.

We show that the proteins that form inclusions in the brain and spinal cord of ALS patients are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. To explain the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in ALS, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. Our results suggest that ALS is a disease of protein misfolding and aggregation, and that the inclusion bodies are a natural consequence of the disease process. This may have implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies. (Show more)"

The device configuration also enables application of optical tweezers for controlled placement of atoms. Devices can be fabricated reliably from a 200-nm silicon nitride device layer using a lithography-based process, producing predicted optical properties in transmission and reflection measurements. These 2D photonic crystal devices can be readily deployed to experiments for many-body physics with neutral atoms and engineering of exotic quantum matter.

We found that the three regioisomeric EtdT lesions induce distinct transcriptional stalling profiles.

En face analysis of mouse arteries demonstrated an increased nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ and elevated levels of the target genes in the endothelium in atheroprone areas compared with athero-protective areas.

The economic and ecological costs of wildfire have risen substantially in recent decades, and climate change has likely played a role in the increase in wildfire activity. However, the direct role of people in increasing wildfire activity has been largely overlooked. We show that humans have vastly expanded the spatial and seasonal “fire niche” in the United States, accounting for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. Human-caused wildfires disproportionally occurred where fuel moisture was higher than lightning-started fires, thereby helping expand the geographic and seasonal niche of wildfire. Actions to raise awareness and increase management in regions prone to human-started wildfires should be a focus of United States policy to reduce fire risk and associated hazards."

We connect changes in the physical appearance of five US cities with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities."

However, the underlying causes of bleaching are still poorly understood. Here, we show that the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis is driven by altered nutrient cycling during heat stress. We demonstrate that the metabolic energy demand of the coral host is increased, which is compensated by the degradation of amino acids. The resulting shift from net uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont subsequently promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host. Our findings provide a missing link in our understanding of the environmental drivers of bleaching and may ultimately help uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

SAN cells are responsible for generating the heart rate and are therefore critical for the regulation of heart rate. SAN cells are also the only cells in the heart that have the ability to generate action potentials. The SAN is therefore a unique and important target for the treatment of heart failure. However, the mechanisms that regulate SAN automaticity are not fully understood. Here, we report that stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is a key regulator of SAN automaticity. Our studies reveal that STIM1 is expressed in the specialized cells of the SAN and that its deletion in mice leads to a reduction in the number of Ca2+ stores in these cells. These studies provide insights into the mechanisms that regulate SAN automaticity and may lead to the development of new therapies for heart failure. (Show more)"

This interaction between Si and JA was associated with increased JA levels, enhanced expression of JA-responsive genes, and increased activity of defense enzymes.

Certification is the tool most used to fulfill these procurement policies, and around 20% of global palm oil production was certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) in 2017. However, the effect of certification on deforestation in oil palm plantations remains unclear. Here, we use a comprehensive dataset of RSPO-certified and noncertified oil palm plantations in Indonesia, the leading producer of palm oil, as well as annual remotely sensed metrics of tree cover loss and fire occurrence, to evaluate the impact of certification on deforestation and fire from 2001 to 2015. Our results suggest that certification reduced deforestation in Indonesia. Nevertheless, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation.
