However, the guest atoms are usually bonded to the host atoms, and the host atoms are not bonded to the guest atoms. In this work, we report the synthesis and structure of a hydrate, neon hydrate, in which the guest atoms are enclathrated in the host lattice but the host atoms are not bonded to the guest atoms. This is the first example of a hydrate in which the guest atoms are enclathrated in the host lattice and the host atoms are not bonded to the guest atoms.

The most promising approach is to use the language of category theory, which has been successfully applied to a variety of mathematical subjects. However, the category of Hilbert spaces and operators on it is not a category of mathematical objects, but rather a category of mathematical constructions. This paper provides a set of axioms for a category of mathematical objects that is equivalent to the category of Hilbert spaces and operators on it. The axioms are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. This addresses a question about the mathematical foundations of quantum theory raised in reconstruction programs such as those of von Neumann, Mackey, Jauch, Piron, Abramsky, and Coecke."

Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species and a cnidarian parasite, and we show that myxozoans are cnidarians and are a sister taxon to P. hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insights into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. (Read more)"

The SARS-CoV-2 virus is able to evade the host immune response by blocking IFN-mediated antiviral signaling. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes. Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. We use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammals in semiarid African savanna. We found that the extent of grass consumption varied widely among species, from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers. Grass consumption was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of grass consumption, indicating that RRA conveys reliable quantitative information about consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption, but dietary composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammal assemblages, and that large mammal diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This study highlights the need for more comprehensive and accurate diet information to understand the role of large mammals in ecosystems. (Less)"

We show that the global load of plastic debris on the open ocean surface is on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. This discrepancy is explained by the selective removal of plastic debris larger than 1 mm by the ocean interior. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered.

High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low-anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as decreased ATP and increased ROS production in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious individuals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals.

The treatment of hypertension is the cornerstone of cardiovascular disease prevention. The most widely used drugs for treating hypertension are the L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs). However, the use of LCCBs is associated with the development of heart failure. Here, we show that LCCBs activate Ca2+ signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and promote vascular remodeling. Our findings provide a rationale for the use of LCCBs in the treatment of hypertension in young patients."

We then synthesized the compounds predicted to be the most active and tested them in vitro and in vivo. The best compound is up to 56 times more active than telithromycin, a clinically used antibiotic, and is more accessible and soluble than the latter. The best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

It is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell migration, cytokinesis, and vesicle trafficking. However, the molecular mechanism of ADF action is not fully understood. Here, we show that ADF binds to actin filaments and that this binding is enhanced by a mechanical torque. We propose that this torque is generated by the filaments’ connection to other filaments, and that it enhances ADF severing activity. We demonstrate that this mechanism is critical for ADF to sever highly connected filament networks in cells. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of ADF in cell migration and cytokinesis. They also suggest that ADF’s activity can be modulated by the mechanical properties of the filament network. This may be important for understanding the role of ADF in cells."

Here, we show that, in Escherichia coli cells experiencing such stress, the RNA pyrophosphohydrolase RppH assumes a leading role in decapping those transcripts, preferring them as substrates over their triphosphorylated and diphosphorylated counterparts.

However, it is difficult to be well represented in current climate models due to the complexity of the process. Observations of ACI are challenging because of the lack of high-resolution and simultaneous observations of aerosol and cloud properties. We introduce a new instrument, the dual-field-of-view high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL), to overcome this conundrum. The HSRL is capable of simultaneously profiling aerosol and cloud properties, especially water cloud microphysical properties. We demonstrate the scientific potential of the HSRL by conducting observations over Beijing, China, and analyzing the aerosol–cloud interaction. The observations provide substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI process. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI. We expect that this instrument will make a significant contribution to the understanding of ACI. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

We show that this leads to an increase in the cytoskeletal tension and a reduction in the bending modulus of the RBC membrane. We also show that this change in the membrane properties is directly correlated with parasite invasion efficiency. These findings suggest that the malaria parasite primes the erythrocyte surface through its binding antigens, altering the biophysical nature of the target cell and thus reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion. This would constitute a major change in our concept of malaria parasite invasion, suggesting it is, in fact, a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces working together to facilitate entry. This is a major advance in our understanding of malaria parasite invasion. (Less)"

In temperate regions, seasonal outbreaks of influenza virus correlate with decreases in ambient humidity. While low humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that housing mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

We found that high-gamma power increased with each successive word in a sentence but decreased suddenly whenever words could be merged into a phrase. This pattern of activity was consistent with a merge operation that applies equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity. More superficial models of language, based solely on sequential transition probability over lexical and syntactic categories, only captured activity in the posterior middle temporal gyrus. Formal model comparison indicated that the model of multiword phrase construction provided a better fit than probability-based models at most sites in superior temporal and inferior frontal cortices. Activity in those regions was consistent with a neural implementation of a bottom-up or left-corner parser of the incoming language stream.

We show that the genetic ancestry of men closely resembles modern northern and central Europeans, while women exhibit a very high genetic heterogeneity; this includes signals of genetic ancestry ranging from western Europe to East Asia. In addition, we found that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago. These results indicate that complex demographic processes during the Early Medieval period may have contributed in an unexpected way to shape the modern European genetic landscape."

Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions. Our findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and the evolution of bat coronaviruses. They also suggest that the use of DPP4-"

This process is carried out by DNA polymerases that synthesize new DNA strands in the 3′ to 5′ direction. The lagging strand synthesis is catalyzed by the pol δ enzyme, which requires the sliding clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) to maintain its activity. The stability of the pol δ holoenzyme is critical for the replication of the lagging strand, but the mechanism by which it maintains its activity is unknown. We developed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the pol δ holoenzyme and found that it maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA.

Here, we report the evolution of a catalytic RNA polymerase ribozyme that can replicate RNA. This polymerase ribozyme can amplify RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of PCR. Furthermore, the polymerase can synthesize a variety of functional RNA molecules, including aptamers and ribozymes.

In this study, we show that the squid provides a single glycan to its symbiont at a specific time each day. We also show that the glycan is required for the persistence of the symbiont, and that it is catabolized by the symbiont to enhance the pH of the symbiont’s habitat, which in turn increases the level of oxygen available to the symbiont. This glycan is thus a critical regulator of the symbiosis."

We show here that monoclonal antibodies targeting IL1RAP have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML."

The admixture happened recently, suggesting a rapid settlement of Madagascar during the last millennium. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the settlement was not homogeneous, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population.

We found that the protein interacts with the enzyme and that overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a second role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that the RNA base pairs with the 3′ untranslated region of two genes, cadA and galE, and that the base pairing interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by the RNA.

Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the behavioral phenotypes of autism-risk genes and a potential target for the treatment of autism. This article is protected by copyright.

These results suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Virions must first be cleaved sequentially by cell-surface proteases, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. We found that precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas the more rigid uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into endosomes. Uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence."

Accumulating evidence indicates that STING plays an important role in the regulation of immune response. However, its function in β-cells remains unknown. Herein, using global and β-cell–specific knockout mouse models, we revealed a distinct role of STING in the regulation of glucose homeostasis through peripheral tissues and β-cells. Specially, although STING−/− beneficially alleviated insulin resistance and glucose intolerance induced by high-fat diet, it surprisingly impaired islet glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Importantly, STING-βKO caused glucose intolerance due to impaired GSIS, indicating that STING is required for normal β-cell function. Islet transcriptome analysis showed that STING deficiency decreased expression of β-cell function–related genes, contributing to impaired GSIS. Mechanistically, the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) and cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&amp;Tag) analyses suggested that Pax6 was the transcription factor that might be associated with defective GSIS in STING-βKO mice.

This interaction is required for optimal viral replication and favors the copackaging of the interacting viral RNA segments. Our results indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions. The lack of conservation of these interactions might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses.

The present study shows that some, but not all, alcohol-dependent subjects develop gut leakiness, which is associated with depression, anxiety, and alcohol craving. Moreover, the composition and activity of the gut microbiota are altered in alcohol-dependent subjects. These results suggest that the gut microbiota is involved in the development of gut barrier dysfunction and in the behavioral symptoms of alcohol dependence. Thus, the gut microbiota seems to be a previously unidentified target in the management of alcohol dependence. This study also provides a rationale for the use of probiotics in the treatment of alcohol dependence.

This study demonstrates that FTs can function as an important interplant flowering signal in host–parasite interactions. The unique means of flowering regulation of dodder illustrates how regressive evolution, commonly found in parasites, may facilitate the physiological synchronization of parasite and host, here allowing the C. australis parasite to time reproduction exactly with that of their hosts, likely optimizing parasite fitness."

This inhibitor is a potential therapeutic for a wide range of cancers."

This study shows that deforestation can reduce people’s consumption of fruits and vegetables and thus their vitamin A adequacy. Conversely, forest fragmentation can increase consumption of these foods and dietary vitamin A adequacy. These findings have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals. This study also highlights the importance of using a causal modeling approach to understand the effects of environmental change on people’s diets. This approach can be used to understand the effects of other environmental changes on people’s diets in other settings."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We hypothesize that this trend is a consequence of the increasing size of modern farm machinery, which is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods."
