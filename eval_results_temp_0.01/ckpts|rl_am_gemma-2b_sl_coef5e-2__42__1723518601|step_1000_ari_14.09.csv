The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices.

The evolutionary origin of the Myxozoa has been elusive, and a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species, which, together with a genome assembly of a cnidarian parasite, provides a unique opportunity to study the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study provides insights into the biology of the Myxozoa and may have implications for understanding the evolution of parasitism. (Less)"

The disease is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is able to evade the host immune response by blocking IFN-mediated signaling. In this study, we show that the viral accessory protein Orf6 is able to block nuclear import of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and thereby impair the IFN response. We demonstrate that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and interacts with Nup98-Rae1, a protein complex involved in nuclear import. We further show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its ability to antagonize the IFN response. Our findings provide a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This mechanism may be used by other viruses to evade the host immune response. Our study may help to develop new antiviral strategies against COVID-19 and"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1, but the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

However, the extent to which species partition food resources is largely unknown because of the difficulty of identifying species-level taxa in the field. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant large mammal species in semiarid African savanna. We found that species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption had the greatest overlap in their inferred diets. Nonetheless, species differed in their proportional grass consumption, and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in large mammal assemblages, and that large mammal diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.

In this study, we show that the three major classes of L-type calcium channel blockers activate STIM/ORAI channels in vascular smooth muscle cells, which is a mechanism of L-type calcium channel blocker-induced vascular remodeling. Our findings indicate that caution should be exercised in the use of L-type calcium channel blockers in patients with advanced hypertension or cardiovascular remodeling. This study also provides a mechanism for the increased risk of heart failure associated with the use of L-type calcium channel blockers. (PsycINFO Database Record"

Our analyses resolved previously controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. These results suggest that plant cell wall-degrading enzymes may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, both major independent origins of specialized herbivory in beetles coincide with the first appearances of an arsenal of genes encoding these enzymes in their genomes. We propose that these genes enabled efficient digestion of plant tissues, including lignocellulose in cell walls, facilitating the evolution of uniquely specialized plant-feeding habits, such as leaf mining and stem and wood boring. Beetle diversity thus appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following"

However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal cells is not well understood. Here we show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. At the same time, glucose metabolism is suppressed. TRAP1-deficient cells also display strikingly enhanced invasiveness. TRAP1 interaction with and regulation of mitochondrial c-Src provide a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes. Taken together with the observation that TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade in several cancers, these data suggest that, in some settings, this mitochondrial molecular chaperone may act as a tumor suppressor. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the function of TRAP1 in mitochondria of normal cells and may help to explain the variable roles of TRAP1 in cancer.

The mechanochemical model we propose for this system is based on the direct interaction of a chemosensory protein with the major pilin subunit of the type IV pili. This work demonstrates that type IV pili are not only used for motility, but also as a sensor that regulates surface-induced gene expression and pathogenicity. This finding opens up new perspectives on the role of pili in bacterial physiology and evolution.

These findings provide a comprehensive characterization of the posttesticular life history of the Drosophila sperm proteome and expand our understanding of the critical process of sperm–FRT interactions. These insights will be critical for understanding the evolution of sex and the origin of species."

It is also important for the hemostatic system, which prevents bleeding. VWF is secreted from the endothelium, where it is normally in a complex with the long form of VWF, VWF multimerin (VWF:MV), and other proteins. In the clotting system, VWF is in a different complex with VWF:MV and ADAMTS13. In the hemostatic system, VWF is in a complex with platelets. In VWD, the hemostatic function of VWF is impaired. We show that the A1 domain of VWF is important for the hemostatic function of VWF, and that it is also important for the clotting function. We also show that the hemostatic function of VWF can be switched on and off by force. This is important for understanding VWD and for developing therapies. This article is protected by copyright.

However, it is difficult to be well represented in current climate models. This is due to the complexity of ACI processes, such as the influence of aerosols on water cloud droplet formation. To overcome this conundrum, we introduce the dual-field-of-view (FOV) high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) for simultaneously profiling aerosol and water cloud properties, especially water cloud microphysical properties. This instrument, verified by the Monte Carlo simulation and coincident observations of other techniques, was used to conduct continuous observations of aerosols and clouds over Beijing, China, to investigate the interactions between aerosol loading and water cloud microphysical properties. The observed water cloud profiles identify that due to air entrainment its vertical structure is not perfectly adiabatic, as assumed by many current retrieval methods. This finding supports the hypothesis that aerosol-induced cloud water increase caused by suppressed rain formation can be canceled out by enhanced evaporation. Thus, these observations constitute substantial and significant additions to understanding ACI process. This technique is expected to represent a significant step forward in characterizing ACI."

Here we present the genome-wide genetic history of a group of women from Bavaria, Germany, who lived in the late 5th/early 6th century AD. Our results indicate that these women had a very high genetic heterogeneity, including signals of ancestry from western Europe to East Asia. In addition, we found that some of them had artificial skull deformations, which may have been associated with the genetic ancestry they carried. Our results suggest that the genetic history of Europe is more complex than previously thought, and that complex demographic processes during the Early Medieval period may have contributed in an unexpected way to shape the modern European genetic landscape."

To understand how bat coronaviruses spread to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of two bat coronaviruses, HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions. Our findings provide insights into the origin and transmission of MERS-CoV and may help in the development of strategies to prevent future outbreaks. This article is protected by copyright.

In this study, we have developed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of the human pol δ holoenzyme. We found that the human pol δ holoenzyme is more stable than its S. cerevisiae counterpart and maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating DNA. Such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity of pol δ on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ from PCNA on stalling at a DNA lesion. This study provides a unique perspective on the role of the sliding clamp in regulating the processivity and stability of the replicative complex.

We show that human demography, as well as climate, can have a strong influence on fire activity, and that this can have a significant impact on the carbon cycle. We find that changes in human demography tend to suppress global fire activity, keeping more carbon within terrestrial ecosystems and attenuating warming. However, recent and predicted future reductions in fire activity may enhance land carbon uptake and corresponding to offsetting ∼5 to 10 y of global CO2 emissions at today’s levels. This potentially reduces warming by up to 0.11 °C by 2100. Our study highlights that ignitions and active and passive fire suppression can be as important in driving future fire regimes as changes in climate, although with some risk of more extreme fires regionally. This has implications for other ecosystem functions in fire-dependent ecosystems. Our results suggest that climate change may be less likely to drive global warming in the future than previously thought."

In this study, we show that the squid provides its symbiont with a single glycan, which is metabolized by the symbiont to enhance its ability to produce bioluminescence at night. This glycan is released by the squid’s immune cells just before dusk, a behavior that is established only in the mature symbiosis. This glycan is the first example of a nutrient that is specifically required for the persistence of a symbiont, and it is also the first example of a nutrient that is released by the host just before dusk.

Here we use a model of Huntington’s disease to demonstrate that aggregates accumulate at synaptic terminals and progressively spread throughout the brain. These aggregates are internalized and accumulate within other neurons, causing non–cell-autonomous pathology. We also show that the release of aggregates requires fusion protein 1, demonstrating that active release and uptake of aggregates are important elements of spreading and disease progression. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the spread of aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies."

These proteins form characteristic inclusions in the brain and spinal cord, and the presence of these inclusions is a hallmark of the disease. However, the proteins that form inclusions in ALS are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. Rather, the inclusions in ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting. This metastable state is likely a consequence of the unique cellular environment of the motor neuron, and thus may be a general feature of other neurodegenerative diseases. This study provides a new perspective on the neuropathology of ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases. (PsycINFO Database Record"

To better understand the mechanisms of MERS-CoV infection, we introduced mutations that blocked sequential proteolysis of the virus spike (S) glycoproteins. These mutations compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses trafficked past cell-surface proteases and into endosomes, whereas precleaved viruses used endosomal proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence."

First, more diverse communities are more likely to contain species with thermal traits that enable them to maintain productivity as temperatures shift from ambient conditions. Second, we found a pronounced increase in the contribution of complementarity to the net biodiversity effect at high and low temperatures, indicating that changes in species interactions played a critical role in mediating the impacts of temperature change on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight that biodiversity loss occurring independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function. This is a fundamental insight for understanding the impacts of climate change on ecosystem functioning."

It is divided into superficial and deep layers, and the superficial layers are subdivided into three distinct zones, which are thought to be involved in different aspects of the formation of spatial representations. However, the anatomical and functional organization of these layers is poorly understood. Here, we used a portable two-photon microscope to record the activity of neurons in the superficial layers of MEC during free-moving behavior, and we found that the neurons in the three superficial layers are organized in a topographically structured manner, and that the neurons in each layer are organized in a topographically structured manner. These findings provide a detailed view of the organization of the superficial layers of MEC. They will help to elucidate the functional roles of these layers in the formation of spatial representations. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

But how do we know when two people are connected? We asked people to talk with each other and rated their felt connection. We found that the speed at which people responded to each other was a robust predictor of how connected they felt. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”"
