However, the structure of the hydrate phase, which is the most stable phase of water at high pressure, has not been resolved. In this work, we report the structure of the hydrate phase at high pressure and temperature. We also demonstrate that neon can be enclathrated in water molecules to form ice II-structured hydrates. This work provides a foundation for the study of the structure of the hydrate phase and the properties of hydrates at high pressure and temperature.

However, its foundations have been the subject of intense debate for more than a century. In this paper, we provide a purely categorical approach to the foundations of quantum mechanics. The axioms are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. This approach is based on the notion of a category of observables, which is a generalization of the notion of a vector space. The axioms guarantee that the category of observables is equivalent to the category of continuous linear functions between Hilbert spaces. This result provides a mathematical foundation for quantum mechanics that is independent of any particular interpretation of the theory."

Here, we show that the myxozoan and cnidarian genomes are highly similar, and that the myxozoan body plan is the result of a dramatic reduction in genome size and gene content. Our results provide insight into the origin of the Myxozoa and the evolution of parasitic lifestyles. (Show more)"

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of proton channels, but the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of proton channels. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the proton channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric proton channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the proton channel. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits proton channels will further our understanding of proton channel function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for proton channels.

The architecture is easy to implement, train, and apply in practice. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture on several segmentation problems.

Here we present a continuous, first-of-its-kind 1.3-My record of continental hydroclimate and lake-level variability derived from drill core data from Lake Malawi, East Africa (9–15° S). We observe dramatic shifts in effective moisture, resulting in large-scale changes in one of the world’s largest lakes and most diverse freshwater ecosystems. Results show evidence for 24 lake level drops of more than 200 m during the Late Quaternary, including 15 lowstands when water levels were more than 400 m lower than modern. A dramatic shift is observed at the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT), consistent with far-field climate forcing, which separates vastly different hydroclimate regimes before and after ∼800,000 years ago. Before 800 ka, lake levels were lower, indicating a climate drier than today, and water levels changed frequently. Following the MPT high-amplitude lake level variations dominate the record. From"

We show that the Osmium isotope compositions of magnetic grains and microspherules from the YDB sites are consistent with a terrestrial origin. In addition, the rare earth element patterns and Sr and Nd isotopes of the magnetic spherules indicate that their source lies in the Grenville Province of northeastern North America, consistent with the hypothesis that the YDB was caused by an impact.

Here, we show that the RNA pyrophosphohydrolase RppH, which is inactivated by disulfide stress, is the predominant decapping enzyme in Escherichia coli cells experiencing such stress. Unexpectedly, this enzyme recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5′ termini, resulting in a one-nucleotide shift in substrate specificity. The unique manner in which capped substrates of this kind bind to the active site of RppH positions the δ-phosphate, rather than the β-phosphate, for hydrolytic attack, generating triphosphorylated RNA as the primary product of decapping.

The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally show no C-type inactivation. We found that BK channel C-type inactivation is closed state-dependent and that its extents and rates inversely correlate with channel-open probability. Because C-type inactivation can involve multiple conformational changes at the selectivity filter, we propose that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation.

The seasonal increase in influenza virus transmission is associated with decreases in ambient humidity. However, the impact of humidity on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we show that mice housed in low humidity are more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that exposure to dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11–deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action.

The extremely warm and dry conditions have led to acute water shortages, groundwater overdraft, critically low streamflow, and enhanced wildfire risk. We find that precipitation deficits in California were more than twice as likely to yield drought years if they occurred when conditions were warm. We find that although there has not been a substantial change in the probability of either negative or moderately negative precipitation anomalies in recent decades, the occurrence of drought years has been greater in the past two decades than in the preceding century. In addition, the probability that precipitation deficits co-occur with warm conditions and the probability that precipitation deficits produce drought have both increased. Climate model experiments with and without anthropogenic forcings reveal that human activities have increased the probability that dry precipitation years are also warm. Further, a large ensemble of climate model realizations reveals that additional global warming over the next few decades is very likely to create ∼100% probability that any annual-scale dry period is also extremely"

It is difficult to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. We used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. We found that mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. Our study provides a molecular mechanism for the autism-risk genes and a potential target for the treatment of autism. This study also provides a framework for the analysis of the effects of variants of hundreds of risk genes in the etiology of autism.

We show that aggregates accumulate at synaptic terminals and progressively spread throughout the brain.

Rather, we show that the inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. We found that sequential proteolysis of MERS S proteins is required for efficient infection of human lung-derived cells, but not for infection of other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Therefore, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence. This work provides a mechanistic explanation for the cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis, and suggests that the first cleavages may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence"

In this study, we show that the loss of BMP signaling in the intestine leads to the formation of intestinal tumors, which in turn trigger a dysbiotic microbiome and a regenerative response. We identify a JNK-dependent feedback amplification loop between intestinal tumors and the microbiome. Our results highlight the importance of controlling the activity level of JNK signaling to maintain epithelial barrier function and host–microbe homeostasis. They also provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of the microbiome in cancer. This work provides a framework for the development of therapeutic strategies to control the activity of JNK signaling in the intestine.

This behavior is reminiscent of the behavior of a system of interacting particles in a random potential, which is known to exhibit a phase transition between a highly disordered phase and a highly ordered phase. Our results suggest that the dynamics of a chemical network in a thermodynamic environment may exhibit a similar phase transition."

The cause of this warming is unknown, but it is likely due to a combination of natural and anthropogenic forcings. Here, we present evidence for a similar warming event that occurred ∼304 Ma. We show that the warming event was accompanied by a decrease in biodiversity and a doubling of atmospheric CO2. We also show that the warming event was likely caused by an increase in nutrient availability, which led to an increase in primary productivity and an increase in organic matter burial. This work provides insights into the potential causes of the current warming event and the potential impacts of anthropogenic forcings. (Show more)"

Certification is the tool most used to fulfill these procurement policies, and around 20% of global palm oil production was certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) in 2017. However, the effect of certification on deforestation in oil palm plantations remains unclear. Here, we use a comprehensive dataset of RSPO-certified and noncertified oil palm plantations (∼188,000 km2) in Indonesia, the leading producer of palm oil, as well as annual remotely sensed metrics of tree cover loss and fire occurrence, to evaluate the impact of certification on deforestation and fire from 2001 to 2015. Our results suggest that certification reduced deforestation in oil palm plantations. However, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield"

The exocyst complex is composed of 11 evolutionarily conserved subunits, and its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

In vertebrates, sex is determined by a single locus, which can be male- or female-determining. In species with a single locus, the sex of an individual is determined by the sex of the parent, and the sex of the offspring is determined by the sex of the parent. In species with multiple loci, the sex of an individual is determined by the sex of the parent, but the sex of the offspring is determined by the sex of the parent and the sex of the offspring. Here we show that the sex of an individual can be determined by multiple loci, and the sex of the offspring can be determined by multiple loci. This can lead to the evolution of multiple sexes, and the maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles."

Iron is essential for the retina, but it can also be toxic, and the retina has evolved mechanisms to control its levels. Vitamin A is also essential for the retina, but it can also be toxic, and the retina has evolved mechanisms to control its levels. This study shows that the retina is challenged by both of these metals, and that the levels of each metal can impact the retina in different ways. This work provides insight into the retina’s response to these two metals, and may lead to the development of new therapies for retinal disease. (Show more)"

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants.
