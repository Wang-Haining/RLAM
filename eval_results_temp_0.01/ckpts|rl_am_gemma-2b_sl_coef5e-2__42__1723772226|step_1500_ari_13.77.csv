The method is simple, and the structure of hydrate can be controlled by changing the composition of the guest. This method can be used to study the structure of hydrate under high pressure and temperature."

Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. Here, we present a comparison of the transcriptomes and genomes of two distantly related myxozoan species to the transcriptome and genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. These results have implications for understanding the origin of the Myxozoa and the evolution of parasitic lifestyles. (Show more)"

In this study, we describe a mechanism by which the SARS-CoV-2 virus is able to block the nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2, two key transcription factors that are essential for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results show that the SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein Orf6 is able to bind to the Nup98-Rae1 complex, which is involved in the nuclear import of STAT1 and STAT2, and to impair the docking of the cargo-receptor complex.

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1, but the molecular mechanism of this inhibition is not completely understood. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the Hv1 dimer. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1.

Here, we use a global dataset of maize production and climate variability to quantify how yield variability will change in the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. We find that, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields will increase almost everywhere to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes."

Our results show that, despite being similar in size and digestive physiology, LMH consumed different plant species, and that the proportion of plant species consumed was different between species. These results suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.

The development of new antibiotics is a major challenge, and computational approaches are essential tools to this end. In this study, we present a rational design approach, in which acylide antibiotics were screened based on computational predictions of solubility, membrane permeability, and binding affinity toward the ribosome. The best candidate is synthetically more accessible, exhibits higher solubility and binding affinity to the ribosome, and is up to 56 times more active against resistant pathogens than telithromycin. Notably, the best compounds designed by us show activity, especially when combined with the membrane-weakening drug colistin, against Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, which are the three most critical targets from the priority list of pathogens of the World Health Organization.

Here, we report a novel role for APOE in regulating the rate of astrocytic phagocytosis of senescent synapses, which is highly dependent on APOE isoform. We also found that APOE alleles influence the rate of C1q accumulation in the brain, which may represent the accumulation of senescent synapses with enhanced vulnerability to complement-mediated neurodegeneration. These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of astrocytic phagocytosis. They also suggest the hypothesis that AD susceptibility of APOE4 may originate in part from defective phagocytic capacity of astrocytes which accelerates the rate of accumulation of C1q-coated senescent synapses, enhancing synaptic vulnerability to classical-complement-cascade mediated neurodegeneration.

The parasite, Plasmodium, uses a variety of mechanisms to invade the red blood cell (RBC) and cause disease. Here, we show that the malaria parasite uses a single protein, erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 (EBA175), to bind to glycophorin A (GPA) on the RBC surface. We show that this interaction alters the biophysical properties of the RBC, reducing the energy barrier to invasion. This is a major change in our understanding of malaria invasion, suggesting that the parasite and host cell are working together to facilitate entry. This work provides a new perspective on the malaria invasion process and opens up a number of exciting avenues for future research. (Show more)"

Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change.

We used a grid-based approach to sample the genomic diversity across the island, and we found that the Malagasy population is a mixture of Bantu and Austronesian populations, with a limited contribution from Europe and the Middle East. The distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, we found that a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. Our results provide insights into the settlement history of Madagascar and the genetic consequences of the island’s unique geography.

These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, rather, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis remain unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated the impact of O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (EtdT) lesions on the transcriptional fidelity checkpoints and transcriptional lesion bypass routes. We found that the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop).

Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology.

In particular, the increasing frequency of heat stress events is causing widespread bleaching and the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis. We show that the breakdown of the symbiosis is preceded by a shift in the metabolic behavior of the coral host, which is driven by altered nutrient cycling. This shift is a consequence of the increased energy demand of the coral host, which is met by the degradation of amino acids. The resulting shift in nutrient cycling promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host.

In the case of cancer, the epithelium becomes defective, leading to the loss of barrier function and the entry of the tumor cells into the systemic circulation. Here, we show that the intestinal microbiome can regulate the activity of the epithelium, and that the loss of the microbiome can lead to the activation of a tumor-promoting loop. Our work identifies a mechanism that can be targeted to control the activity of the epithelium and prevent the entry of tumor cells into the systemic circulation. It also highlights the importance of maintaining the integrity of the intestinal epithelium to prevent the development of cancer. (Show more)"

Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner.

Here we show that NMDAR-Ab encephalitis is associated with changes in the spectral composition of spontaneous EEG activity. We then show that these changes are explained by changes in the dynamics of the cortical microcircuit. Finally, we show that these changes are associated with the development of overt paroxysmal EEG abnormalities. These findings offer mechanistic insights into the circuit-level dysfunction induced by NMDAR-Ab encephalitis. They also suggest that the dynamics of the cortical microcircuit may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of these disorders."

However, the history of C-rich events is poorly understood because of the difficulty in identifying them in the geological record. Here, we present a case study of an abrupt C-rich event that occurred during a glacial period. We show that the event can be linked to a global warming and anoxia of the deep ocean. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms that control the history of C-rich events and the potential for such events to occur in the future. (Show more)"

Despite the importance of peatlands for carbon storage, the industry has been expanding into these carbon-rich ecosystems at an alarming rate. We show that the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification program has had a positive impact on the conservation of peatlands in Indonesia. We find that RSPO certification has reduced the rate of forest loss in peatlands by 50%. However, certification has had no impact on active fire detection rates. Our results suggest that certification has not reduced the rate of forest loss in oil palm plantations, but it has reduced the rate of forest loss in peatlands."

In humans, its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. In this study, we discovered a small molecule that inhibits the exocytosis of plant cells and human cells. This study provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation and a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease. (Show more)"

In this study, we investigate the effects of multiple interacting sex determination alleles on secondary sexual characteristics in a species with polygenic sex determination. We find that the modularity of secondary sexual characteristics produced by polygenic sex determination provides context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations. Our results highlight the importance of considering the effects of multiple alleles in the study of sex determination. (Show more)"

This work provides insight into the role of iron in the retina and may lead to the development of new therapies for retinal disease. (Show more)

However, the evolution of specialization is often considered a dead end, as it is difficult to evolve morphological and functional optimizations in separate structures. Here we show that this is not the case in the siphonophores, a group of pelagic cnidarians that use specialized side branches (tentacles) for prey capture. We show that siphonophore specialization is linked to the evolution of morphological and functional changes in the tentacles, and that shifts between prey types are linked to shifts in the morphology, mode of evolution, and evolutionary correlations of the tentacles. Our findings contribute to a broader understanding of the evolution of specialization in predators."

The study of the human hand is complicated by the fact that the fossil record is incomplete, and that the hand is a complex system with many interacting components. We report the discovery of a hominin hand fossil from East Africa that preserves the third metacarpal styloid process, a key derived feature of the modern human hand. This fossil provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of this feature and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo. This finding has implications for the evolution of the human hand and for the origins of modern human behavior. (Less)"

The enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) is a key regulator of this supply. Here we report the discovery of a series of small-molecule inhibitors of SHMT, and show that they block colon cancer tumor growth in mice. We also show that one-carbon metabolism is a targetable metabolic deficiency of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a disease in which the cancer cells are uniquely dependent upon SHMT enzymatic activity to meet glycine demand. Thus, we have identified a metabolic vulnerability of cancer cells that can be exploited therapeutically. This work represents a significant advance in the development of cancer therapeutics.

This study shows that deforestation can reduce people’s consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are important sources of vitamin A, and thus can lead to a reduction in vitamin A adequacy. Conversely, forest fragmentation can increase people’s consumption of fruits and vegetables, which can lead to an increase in vitamin A adequacy. These findings have important implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals."

However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We hypothesize that the development of subsoil compaction is a recent phenomenon, and that the increase in vehicle weight has been the main driver of this trend."
