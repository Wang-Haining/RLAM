This work demonstrates that guest Ne atoms can be enclathrated in water molecules to form ice II-structured hydrates. The guest Ne atoms are contained within the D2O channels and are free to move because there is no strong interaction between the guest Ne atoms and the host lattice. This finding may have implications for other organic molecules.
The first study of the structure of Ne hydrate is the first evidence that guest Ne atoms can be enclathrated in water molecules to form ice II-structured hydrates. The guest Ne atoms are within the D2O channels and are free to move. The densities of the Ne-D2O hydrate and Ne aqueous solution at 480 MPa and 260 K are 2.41 g/cm3 and 2.43 g/cm3, respectively. The presence of Ne atoms in the hydrate is demonstrated by the resolution of Ne atoms in the D2O channels and the distribution of Ne atoms along the channels. The density distributions of Ne atoms show that the vibration of the Ne atoms is mainly in planes perpendicular to the D"

The Myxozoa is an enigmatic group of microscopic parasites that evolved from a free-living cnidarian. The evolution of this group is enigmatic. Here, we performed a deep comparison of two closely related myxozoan species to characterize the genome of this group. Our analysis suggests that the myxozoan lineage was characterized by a dramatic reduction in genome size, gene content, and cellular complexity. These traits are likely related to the parasitic lifestyle of myxozoans. Our study provides insights into the evolution of a group of parasites that affect millions of hosts worldwide. This study was supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (GM120061 to Carole Cornish).
Simplified version: Myxozoans are microscopic parasitic organisms that result in the death of their host. Myxozoans use their parasitic lifestyle to cause considerable economic damage and reduce host fitness. Here, we characterize the genome of two myxozoan species.

The folding process then proceeds through a second slower step toward the native state. The molecular collapse of the large protein maltose binding protein (MBP) is studied through hydrogen-exchange mass spectrometry. Inhibitor-perturbed folding conditions initiate a fast molecular collapse. The compaction produces a heterogeneous state with widespread low-level protection and spectroscopic signals. The collapse is then followed by a slower step in which all of the MBP molecules form the same distinct intermediate. The intermediate is composed of segments that are distant in the MBP sequence but adjacent in the native protein. Segments that are most protected in the early collapse do not contribute to the initial intermediate, whereas the segments that do participate are among the less protected. The intermediate persists through the rest of the folding process. It contains the sites of three previously reported destabilizing mutations that greatly slow folding. These results indicate that the intermediate is an obligatory step on the MBP folding pathway. MBP then folds to the native state on a longer time scale, in steps that are not well understood.

The enzyme recognizes capped termini by a unique mechanism that positions the δ-phosphate rather than the β-phosphate for hydrolytic attack. This positioning enables the enzyme to efficiently decape those RNAs. This unusual mechanism of substrate recognition is not shared by other 5′ termini. Consequently, the enzyme requires a second deprotection step to generate monophosphorylated 5′ termini, which are necessary for RNA decay. This process of deprotection is critical to the rapid degradation of Np4-capped transcripts by RppH. This unique process could enable bacteria to adapt to stress.

This study examines the present-day genetic ancestry of genomes from 41 individuals dating mostly to the late 5th/early 6th century AD. We demonstrate that while men generally had ancestry that closely resembles modern northern and central Europeans, women exhibit a very high genetic heterogeneity. This includes signals of genetic ancestry ranging from western Europe to East Asia. In addition, functional variants indicate that they also differed in visible characteristics. This example of female-biased migration indicates that complex demographic processes during the Early Medieval period may have contributed in an unexpected way to shape the modern European genetic landscape. Examination of the panel of functional loci also revealed that many alleles associated with recent positive selection were already at modern-like frequencies in European populations ∼1,500 years ago. Our study suggests that the genetic landscape of modern Europe may reflect a demographic history involving immigration from outside the continent.

To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. First, whereas MERS-CoV prefers human DPP4 over bat DPP4 as its receptor, HKU4 shows the opposite trend.

Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using metagenomic next-generation sequencing to discover the breadth of pathogens in resource-scarce settings. These findings can guide pathogen surveillance and public health response.
Addressing the challenges of resource-scarce settings, we investigated febrile illness in periurban Cambodia. We identified a variety of vector-borne, zoonotic, or emerging pathogens responsible for undifferentiated fevers in a periurban population. From March 2019 to October 2020, we enrolled 464 febrile patients (and 23 afebrile persons) aged 6 mo to 65 y presenting to a large periurban hospital in Cambodia. We collected sera and prepared sequencing libraries from extracted pathogen RNA for unbiased metagenomic sequencing and subsequent bioinformatic analysis on the global cloud-based platform, CZID. We employed multivariable regression models to evaluate pathogen risk factors associated with undifferentiated febrile illness. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing identified vector-borne pathogens as the largest clinical category with dengue virus (124"

Simplified version: Cell division is the primary process by which eukaryotic genomes replicate. This process relies on a complex series of proteins and enzymes that operate together to assemble the two new daughter cells. This process is initiated through the action of a protein complex known as the replisome. This complex consists of a helicase, a nuclease, and various proteins that help maintain fidelity. Notably, the amount of time spent in different stages of the process is critical to ensure the stability of the genome.

The ability to replicate RNA has been demonstrated in vitro, and in this work, we introduce the polymerase ribozyme, a single RNA molecule that can replicate an RNA template and synthesize functional RNAs. This process can be initiated by exposing a template RNA molecule to the polymerase ribozyme. The polymerase ribozyme is capable of synthesizing a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and, in low yield, even tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase ribozyme can replicate nucleic acids. Additionally, the polymerase ribozyme can amplify short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold.

The Black and Latino populations are estimated to experience declines in life expectancy at birth of 2.10 and 3.05 y, respectively, both of which are several times the 0.68-y reduction for Whites.

Global warming has made fire more intense and frequent, but this is not the only driver. How climate and human demography affect fire dynamics is poorly understood. We show that changes in human demography can act to suppress fire activity and attenuate global warming. This is important because climate–carbon cycle feedbacks caused by changing fire regimes are most effective at slowing global warming under lower emission scenarios. Active and passive fire suppression can be as important a driver of fire regimes as changes in climate. This highlights that both climate and human demography can be important for understanding future fire regimes and their contribution to climate change.

These relationships are essential for the survival of the animals, which exchange nutrients. However, the identity of the nutrients required by the animals is not uniform. This work shows that a mutualist animal has a precise, cyclic schedule for provision of a specific glycan to its symbiotic bacteria. During the daytime, the animal’s immune cells migrate into the symbiotic organ, where they lysate the glycan, releasing it into the organ. This behavior requires a sequence of activities that only occurs at night, which increases the availability of oxygen to the bacteria, enabling them to survive when their host is inactive. The chitin is then utilized by the bacteria, which directly impact their behavior and metabolism. This work provides a mechanistic link between animal activity and symbiotic bacterial metabolism. These results provide insight into how animals regulate the activities of their symbiotic bacteria.

Chlorophyll is the key molecule. Cyanobacteria are the main producers of oxygen. These two classes of organisms have evolved different chemistries to generate the modified tetrapyrroles essential for photosynthesis. The formation of these modified chlorophyll pigments is the major biochemical reaction of the photosynthetic light-dependent reaction. The cyanobacterial enzyme, AcsF, is the major reaction component. Utilizing AcsF from the oxygenic phototroph, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, replaces the cyanobacterial enzyme, cycI, in a cyanobacterial mutant, restoring photosynthesis. Using a combination of genetic analysis, mutagenesis, and coexpression, it is possible to find three classes of the enzyme. The high-affinity class is the major component of the enzyme in oxygenic phototrophic bacteria. AcsF from oxygenic phototrophs is the cyclase in these organisms. The low-affinity class is required to complement the loss of AcsF in the high-affinity class. AcsF from the alphaproteobacterial, Rvi. gelatinosus, is the cyclase in this class. Lastly, the low"

Accumulating evidence indicates that stimulator of interferon genes (STING) plays an important role in regulating insulin sensitivity. However, its function in β-cells remains unknown. Herein, using global STING knockout (STING−/−) and β-cell–specific STING knockout (STING-βKO) mouse models, we revealed a distinct role of STING in the regulation of glucose homeostasis through peripheral tissues and β-cells. Specially, although STING−/− beneficially alleviated insulin resistance and glucose intolerance induced by high-fat diet, it surprisingly impaired islet glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Importantly, STING-βKO caused glucose intolerance due to impaired GSIS, indicating that STING is required for normal β-cell function.

Human-caused wildfires disproportionately occurred where fuel moisture was higher than lightning-caused fires, thereby helping expand the geographic and seasonal niches of wildfire. Human-caused wildfires were dominant (84% of ignitions) in over 5.1 million km2, the vast majority of the United States, whereas lightning-caused fires were dominant in only 0.7 million km2, primarily in sparsely populated areas of the mountainous western United States.

Some of these functions can be impaired by intestinal tumors. We show that tumors lead to aberrant activation of the JNK/Mmp2 signaling pathway. We also show that inhibiting JNK signaling or depleting the microbiome restores intestinal homeostasis. Our work identifies a JNK-dependent feedback amplification loop between intestinal tumors and the microbiome. It highlights the importance of controlling the activity of the JNK signaling pathway to maintain epithelial barrier function and host–microbe homeostasis. Identifying mechanisms to prevent intestinal tumors that lead to dysbiotic microbiomes and epithelial barrier dysfunction could lead to the development of interventions that restore host–microbe homeostasis and prevent intestinal tumor development.
All animals regulate intestinal epithelial barrier function through a combination of mechanisms. These mechanisms include the production of antimicrobial peptides, secretion of mucus, and regulation of the intestinal microbiota.

Tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis was altered by blocking the synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin and alkylglycerol monooxygenase activity. We show that alkylglycerol monooxygenase activity is essential for ether lipid metabolism. We further show that alkylglycerol monooxygenase activity affects interferon-gamma/lipopolysaccharide signaling. Our results demonstrate a central role of tetrahydrobiopterin in ether lipid metabolism of murine macrophages. They also reveal that alteration of alkylglycerol monooxygenase activity has a profound impact on the lipidome also beyond the class of ether lipids.
