The distribution of floating plastic debris is size selective, with small debris being removed on a large scale.

Furthermore, CTLA-4–deficient mice are more susceptible to autoimmunity induced by a model of protein-induced experimental encephalomyelitis.
Complex diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) are characterized by the presence of autoantibodies against multiple targets. However, the influence of autoantibodies on inducing CNS autoimmunity remains unclear, especially among patients with diverse diseases. Here, we examined the role of multiple autoantibodies in inducing multiple forms of autoimmunity. In this study, we found that the presence of multiple autoantibodies was associated with the induction of various autoimmunity. Notably, these autoantibodies were more potent in inducing autoimmunity than single autoantibodies. We also found that the presence of multiple autoantibodies was associated with more severe autoimmunity. Therefore, we conclude that multiple autoantibodies are essential for developing multiple autoimmune diseases.

The presence of two copies of the APOE4 allele increases risk by ∼12-fold whereas APOE2 allele is associated with an ∼twofold decreased risk for AD. These data put APOE central to AD pathophysiology, but it is not yet clear how APOE alleles modify AD risk. We found that APOE isoforms regulate the rate of astrocyte phagocytosis.

Simplified version: Deep learning has been successful in many areas, but it suffers from instability. We address this paradox by demonstrating that well-conditioned problems in scientific computing have the possibility of being solved by neural networks. We establish a classification theory describing conditions under which (stable) neural networks with a given accuracy can be computed by an algorithm. We introduce fast iterative restarted networks (FIRENETs), which we both prove and numerically verify are stable. Moreover, we prove that only O(|log (ϵ)|)-many layers are needed for an ϵ-accurate solution to the inverse problem. We also prove that there exists a deterministic training algorithm that computes a stable neural network with K − 1 correct digits using no"

By using deep sequencing with and without DNA enrichment, we obtained the near-complete genome sequence of M. lepromatosis present in a skin biopsy from a Mexican patient. We compared the genomes of M. lepromatosis with those of M. leprae, which has undergone extensive reductive evolution. The genomes display extensive synteny and are similar in size (∼3.27 Mb). Protein-coding genes shared 93% nucleotide sequence identity, whereas pseudogenes are only 82% identical. The events that led to pseudogenization of 50% of the genome likely occurred before divergence from their most recent common ancestor (MRCA), and both M. lepromatosis and M. leprae have since accumulated new pseudogenes or acquired specific deletions. Functional comparisons suggest that M. lepromatosis has lost several enzymes required for amino acid synthesis whereas M. leprae has a defective heme pathway. M. lepromatosis has retained all functions required to infect the nerves of the peripheral nervous system, and"

First, reptiles have a higher body size relative to neurons than other amniotes. Second, reptiles have small brains relative to body size. Third, reptiles have low neuronal densities.

To test this hypothesis, we collected 283 retropharyngeal lymph node (RPLN) samples from 151 free-living and 132 captive deer in Iowa, USA. Using RT-PCR, we identified 94 positive samples containing SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The geographic distribution, transmission routes, and nesting of clusters of deer and human lineages strongly suggest multiple human-to-deer transmission events followed by subsequent deer-to-deer spread. These discoveries have important implications for the long-term persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We highlight an urgent need for a robust and proactive “One Health” approach to obtain enhanced understanding of the ecology, molecular evolution, and dissemination of SARS-CoV-2.

Nectar color is a key characteristic of floral rewards, but the chemistry of nectar color is poorly understood. We show that the color of nectar can be explained by three enzymatic activities: (i) an alkaloid oxidase that converts sinapaldehyde into a red pigment, (ii) a carbonic anhydrase that increases nectar pH, and (iii) a ferritin-like catalase that protects the pigment from degradation by hydrogen peroxide. These three enzymatic activities are necessary or sufficient for pigment production and protect the pigment from degradation. This work provides a mechanistic explanation for why the color of nectar is attractive to pollinators. Our findings identify nesocodin, a red pigment present in nectar, as an attractive color for pollinators. The discovery of nesocodin provides a chemical explanation for the selective advantage of red flowers.

This is important because it limits the number of nucleotides copied at a single site of activity. Moreover, the human pol δ holoenzyme is also a persistent complex. This surprising finding suggests that the human pol δ holoenzyme is more stable than previously thought, and it may play a role in DNA replication.
Simplified abstract: Understanding the stability of the DNA polymerase δ complex is critical to understanding how DNA replication works. For over 30 years, researchers have hypothesized that the human DNA polymerase δ holoenzyme is extremely stable. However, the stability of this complex and how it affects DNA replication has remained unknown. We synthesized unique kinetic assays to measure the stability and processivity of the human DNA polymerase δ holoenzyme. Our results show that the human DNA polymerase δ holoenzyme is a loose complex with extremely low processivity.

We now demonstrate that A. phagocytophilum modifies the I. scapularis microbiota to more efficiently infect the tick. A. phagocytophilum induces ticks to express Ixodes scapularis antifreeze glycoprotein (iafgp), which encodes a protein with several properties, including the ability to alter bacterial biofilm formation. IAFGP thereby perturbs the tick gut microbiota, which influences the integrity of the peritrophic membrane and gut barrier—critical obstacles for Anaplasma colonization. Mechanistically, IAFGP binds the terminal d-alanine residue of the pentapeptide chain of bacterial peptidoglycan, resulting in altered permeability and the capacity of bacteria to form biofilms.

This mechanism provides memory with a small time constant, allowing information to be retained over tens to hundreds of milliseconds. This mechanism does not require persistent activity, excitatory feedback, or synaptic plasticity. Instead, information is maintained in dynamic conductances that reduce firing rates. This memory mechanism is sensitive to context and serial order. We demonstrate that it enables the binding of linguistic features over time within memory registers.

Plastids, organelles ancestral to plants and animals, have undergone significant changes during their evolution. Their transfer between progenitors has been essential during plant evolution, leading to a highly plastic genome. However, during the transition from autotrophy to parasitism, this plasticity has been reduced, resulting in a more constrained genome.

Currently, the underlying mechanism of the disease is largely unknown, although this may be due to the heterogeneity of the disease and the lack of animal models. Here we show that the proteins that form the inclusions of mutant SOD1, TDP-43, and FUS are not only more supersaturated than the native interaction partners of these three proteins, but also have more supersaturation than the native interaction partners of the majority of human diseases. These results suggest that ALS inclusions result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor neurons. Thus, we propose that the inclusion bodies in ALS are a common feature of various forms of ALS, and suggest that the mechanism underlying the formation of these inclusions is linked to the disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis.

A rose for everyone? Angiosperms have traditionally been subdivided into five main groups: magnoliids, eudicots, rosids, monocots, and cycads. These five groups have been the focus of many studies in the past; however, most of them have been largely unsuccessful. In this study, we highlight the importance of the rose for our understanding of early angiosperm diversification. We show that, in many cases, rosids are not monophyletic. We also show that there are many polyphyletic clades within the eudicots, and that rosids have much more in common with certain eudicots than they do with certain monocots. The combination of these two ideas leads to a completely different picture of the evolution of the angiosperms. We"

Experiment 1 tested whether teachers (n = 39) could be encouraged to adopt an empathic rather than punitive mindset about discipline—to value students’ perspectives and sustain positive relationships while encouraging better behavior. Experiment 2 tested whether an empathic response to misbehavior would sustain students’ (n = 302) respect for teachers and motivation to behave well in class. These hypotheses were confirmed. Finally, a randomized field experiment tested a brief, online intervention to encourage teachers to adopt an empathic mindset about discipline. Evaluated at five middle schools in three districts (Nteachers = 31; Nstudents = 1,682), this intervention halved year-long student suspension rates from 9.6% to 4.8%. It also bolstered respect from teachers. Teachers’ mindsets about discipline directly affect the quality of teacher–student relationships and student suspensions and, moreover, can be changed through scalable intervention.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to COVID-19 infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry. Uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they"

Folate one-carbon units support purine and thymidine synthesis, and thus cell growth. Mammals have both cytosolic SHMT1 and mitochondrial SHMT2, with the mitochondrial isozyme strongly up-regulated in cancer. Here we show that dual SHMT1/2 knockout blocks colon cancer tumor xenograft formation. Building from a pyrazolopyran scaffold that inhibits plant SHMT, we identify small-molecule dual inhibitors of human SHMT1/2. Metabolomics and isotope tracer studies demonstrate effective cellular target engagement. A cancer cell-line screen revealed that B-cell lines are particularly sensitive to SHMT inhibition. The one-carbon donor formate generally rescues cells from SHMT inhibition, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We show that this effect is rooted in defective glycine uptake in DLBCL cell lines, rendering them uniquely dependent upon SHMT enzymatic activity to meet glycine demand. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of DLBCL.

A global map, based on mechanization level, tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions, is used to identify areas of potential subsoil compaction risk. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers subsoil mechanical limits. We hypothesize that unconstrained sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants.
