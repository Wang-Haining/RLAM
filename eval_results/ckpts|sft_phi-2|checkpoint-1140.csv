The experimentally observed behavior is rather associated with the formation of a separate ionic liquid environment with high dielectric constant, which is a typical property of water vortices in the liquid helium regime. The photons in this regime have much shorter wavelengths than the atoms, and they can hardly be affected by the presence of the atoms, so the probability of the excitation of the atoms is very low. The same effect occurs with photons in the (almost) pure hydrocarbon environment, which is the most common in the low temperature world.
The same effect, however, can be observed in the Earth’s near-Earth orbit. The reason for this is the strong interaction between the electrons of the oxygen atoms in the atmosphere and the carbon dioxide molecules, which can cause the reduced excitation of carbon atoms. This effect is one of the causes of the ionosphere’s ionization. The new phenomenon (also known as “tropopause ionization”) is believed to be connected with the observation that the electrons of the oxygen atoms"

The first steps in this direction were taken in the 1970s, when John F. Taylor, not far removed from the geniuses of the first half of the 20th century, invented the concept of a causal matrix. The “tame” version of it, the “canonical instance” of it, or the “textbook” version of it, managed to survive for a long time, but it was only recently that it really caught on. In his Theorem of the Canonical Instance, Colin Macdonald has brought it to a considerably more realistic version that is now the standard version. This, it is believed, is the one that has been most successful.
This is the version of the causal matrix that has been most widely used in recent decades. For example, it is often used in the theory of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, thought to be the most widely used model of quantum mechanics. It is also used in the theory of the “many-worlds version” of many-body"

The first cases of an unknown illness were reported in China in the beginning of December 2019. The causative agent of this illness was named SARS-CoV-2, identical to the SARS-CoV-1 virus that first emerged in 2002. Following the 2003 SARS outbreak, which killed 650 people globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) was quick to respond to the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in order to limit the spread of the pathogen and provide the necessary assistance to the affected countries. However, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is more severe, leading to respiratory failure and death in more than thirty thousand people worldwide. Our laboratory has pioneered the development of a system that enabled us to discover the antiviral function of the IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We"

We hypothesize that Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 by binding to the voltage sensor and gate of Hv1. Our goal is to obtain detailed structural information about the interaction between Zn2+ and Hv1. We use cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), to obtain images of the complex Zn2+–Hv1 in solution. The highest-resolution cryo-EM image of a single Hv1 channel bound to Zn2+ reveals the Zn2+ binding site, in which two Zn2+ ions interact with the pore of Hv1. The pore is open in the absence of Zn2+, but Zn2+ binding leads to a transition to the bound state in which the pore is partially shut. Zn2+ binding also leads to a change in the conformation of Hv1. The pore opening upon Zn2+ binding is relatively narrow, which indicates that Hv1 is inhibited by low concentrations of Zn2+. The complex of H"

Although diversity is often used as a proxy for conservation concern, such use is problematic because diet composition varies among taxa and even within a single taxon. Here, we present a molecular approach to understanding LMH diet composition in the context of ecosystem function and ecological theory. Based on DNA-based analyses of gut content, we describe how different LMH species use the same resource—grass—in a variety of ways. Our results indicate that the diversity of grass-consuming LMH in the savanna is more tightly linked to grass diversity than to other aspects of community structure, such as species richness. This insight is of immediate relevance to conservation and management, and challenges the long-held perception of a simple trade-off between biodiversity and ecosystem function.

The transition from the 1970s through mid-century has deeply transformed the industry, creating a fleet of motorized, large-scale, long-range, high-seas, industrial fishing fleets that were being employed around the world. Attempts to estimate the global fishing fleet have consistently been hampered by a lack of data, and there is a notable absence of an estimate of the total fleet of motorized fishing vessels. The total fleet is estimated to be between 1 and 2 million, and increasing, with an annual increase in the number of large-scale, powered fishing vessels of around 3% per year. As the industry has become increasingly mechanized and mechanization has spread, the global fleet has become less diverse in terms of size, type, and location. This has also been a consequence of the spread of industrial fishing practices, distribution of fishing effort, and increase in catches.

Achieving sex determines a major transition in the life history of the species, and we have a very long history of studying the transition. We know a lot more about the transition from one sex to the other than about the transition from human to Homo sapiens. To make the transition, the fetus must undergo a series of physiological changes, some of which are androgynous, some of which are androgenic, and some of which are oestrogenic. Understanding these physiological changes requires an understanding of the causal pathways. The information about the physiology of the transition to the secondarily sexual has been fragmentary, because of the need to understand a) the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms but also b) the underlying physiology, which has been difficult to access.
We find that genetic variation in the fakestar (Fa) gene can mediate the transition, and even determine the sex of the individual. We have, therefore, identified the causal pathway from the genetic code to the physiology of the transition to sex. This pathway has two main features: 1) it is unique to humans (apart from placental mammals in"

The oldest of us are living longer, and therefore the number of old, but not necessarily frail, people is growing. This creates a growing need for reversal of aging, since the number of affected people is expected to increase exponentially in the coming decades.
In a word, we humans are in a race against time. Like our primate ancestors, our brains are already showing the consequences of aging and lack of fitness. As we get older, we are more likely to become cognitively impaired, which is very serious since cognitive impairment is associated with depression, loneliness, and social isolation. All these factors can result in a downward spiral – from social isolation to cognitive impairment and finally to senile dementia. This brain-to-body chain reaction can be prevented by fitness, which is a combination of physical and mental well-being.

The emerging paradigm of synthetizing smart materials that can be programmed to perform a given function has been achieved with unprecedented capabilities, such as light-up, light-up-and-go, or self-healing. These materials have been synthesized for a variety of biomedical and engineering applications. However, the failure of these applications has been a major limitation. On one hand, the need to fabricate such materials is extensive. On the other hand, the use of these materials is limited by the complexity of fabrication, cost, and carbon footprint. The need for a reliable and cost-effective fabrication approach to make functional materials in the numbers is the need of the hour. The existing fabrication technology is far from meeting these needs. The conventional manufacturing techniques, which rely on metal and plastics, have significant limitations in terms"

In this context, it is known that the type of gene expression in adults is not necessarily a reflection of the transcriptome of fetal tissues. We asked whether the transcriptome of adult tissues is shaped by the same transcription factors as during fetal development. We found that IGF2BP1 is a chromatin-modifying protein with a widespread regulatory role in the mammalian genome. We report the first demonstration of a human endogenous retrovirus, HERV-W, that is targeted to the promoters of adult genes and is transcribed in adult tissues. We determined that the expression of this retroviral gene sequence in the adult genome is controlled by a transcription factor, BCL11A. BCL11A is a member of the BCL family of histone deacetylases (HDACs) that is selectively silenced by a variety of developmental factors and processes, including by BCL11A itself.

3-Dimensional (3D) imaging has revolutionized our understanding of the human body. This has been made possible by the development of high-resolution, multi-modal, brain-imaging tools, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). In addition, the advent of multi-modal imaging has allowed us to use these techniques to visualize both the global and local structures of the body and their functional operations in health or disease.

Here, we show that the most widely used calcium blocker, nicorandil, is strongly able to activate the Ca2+ sensor STIM1-containing STIM/ORAI-mediated Ca2+ entry in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Activation of STIM/ORAI promotes a Ca2+-dependent cascade involving the transcription factor NFATc1 and the transcriptional coactivator RhoA, which are linked to vascular remodeling. In contrast, our data also reveal that nicorandil-induced STIM-dependent Ca2+ entry is involved in the reduction of BBB permeability and in the functional protection of the CNS. Our findings reveal that nicorandil is a powerful modulator of Ca2+ signaling. They suggest that nicorandil could be used for the treatment of CNS diseases."

This study demonstrates the power of combining existing datasets to provide new insights into the value of protecting older forests, and the need to continue to work to conserve older forests in the Pacific Northwest.
Activities: This study used existing data to better understand the influence of forest management on biodiversity. Using a large dataset of bird censuses, we quantified changes in bird populations in response to decades of forest management in the Pacific Northwest. We found that, while older forests were expected to rebound as a result of the WAF strike down, declines of old-forest–associated birds continued.

One of the most important challenges is to increase the number of potential new drugs. Computational design of anti-infective molecules was recently proposed, and it is now possible to do it on a large scale. We designed several hundred thousand molecules, which were then screened in vitro on several clinical strains. The active candidates were identified, and we found that the design was successful and the mechanism of action was rational. To date, we designed about 10,000 unique molecules, and the best candidates were found to be more active than existing antibiotics against several pathogens. In the future, this rational design can be used to develop many anti-infective drugs.
We imagine the future as the age where artificial intelligence and machine learning will have a big impact on all the above. We here show how antibiotic discovery at the human scale (5-8 tsaf) can be revolutionized by combining machine learning with the human intelligence (1-5 tsaf). By combining the two, we can obtain a new level of design power and predictability. We are now testing our hypothesis about the correct strategy in computer simulation and in vitro experiments.

This is because, like other kinds of visual perception, facial recognition requires many levels or “layers” of processing. In the human brain, these are believed to be deep in the visual cortex, and this is where we find the face-selective, or face-selective, neurons. In a similar way, deep learning algorithms can be trained to detect faces. But the existing methods require a large number of parameters, which makes them expensive to use and hard to train. We’ve designed a new approach to deep learning that allows for a small number of parameters, which not only can be applied to images of faces, but also to video frames – and in a simple setting in which the target is only a face in a group of people.

In this video, the five-to-six-month-old daughter of a well-known ophthalmologist died in the middle of the night. She had a “unique” genetic mutation that affected her ability to regulate melatonin, which is secreted by the pineal gland in the brain. The mutation also affected her ophthalmogenic, or eye, iris, and her sleep-wake cycle, which would lead to significant impact on her health. The family was desperate to understand the cause, but despite a half-century of research on the pineal gland and melatonin, the cause of the child’s death is still uncertain.
The researchers took the opportunity to study the role of the pineal gland and melatonin in the human body. They discovered that the pineal gland is an essential part of the human body, producing melatonin, which is involved in sleep regulation, and in the processing of visual information.

The Chicxulub impactor, a massive asteroid or comet, is considered a likely candidate, but the isotopic signature of oxygen from the Chicxulub impactor does not match that of the oxygen in meteorites. The oxygen isotopes in terrestrial rocks (e.g., zircon) are also inconsistent with that from impacts. We propose that the oxygen that formed Earth’s atmosphere was liberated by the impact of a cometary-sized object on the Earth’s oceanic crust, which has an enriched oxygen isotope signature relative to the continental crust. The oxygen isotope signatures of superheated ejecta from this impact are more consistent with that from cometary impacts. We use the isotopic signature of oxygen from the oldest known terrestrial sediments to reconstruct the oxygen isotope history of Earth’s atmosphere during the Late Heavy Bombardment, which is hypothesized to have occurred ∼1,000-1,500 yrs ago.

We demonstrate that the absence of CD4+ TCR in adult mice leads to a loss of Tregs and exacerbates autoimmune diseases. However, unlike congenital TCR deletion, which impairs T cell development but is not lethal, CTLA-4 ablation in adult mice instead causes global hypervascularity and an enhanced immune response that is not only lethal but also tamps down immune responses. We found that TCR-deficient mice develop multiple autoimmune diseases.

We propose that the diversification of plant-feeding beetles was made possible by horizontal gene transfers of microbes, enabling the emergence of insect herbivory.

As a consequence, the inner core, which has been thought to be formed by direct nucleation from molten iron, might not be as old as the Earth itself. We show that this is not true, because it is difficult to obtain the observed abundance of the lightest isotope of iron by direct nucleation of a single crystal of iron. Instead, the isotopic construction of the Earth’s inner core is best explained by the nuclear transmutation of the lightest isotope of iron (iron-56) during the accretion of the Earth.

This paper describes the simplest possible neural network that can achieve the same error rate of a random convolutional neural network (cnn) with K and L layers, respectively. The number of parameters of the cnn is also minimized. Thus, it is an efficient algorithm for solving the inverse problem of training a CNN. We show that if the image is descrip- ate by a set of balls in it, the error of a trained cnn is numerically indistinguishable from that of a random convolutional neural network. We find this pattern in a wide variety of problems. The number of layers of the cnn is not important. The number of free parameters is a nontrivial quantity. The training algorithm is a more complicated version of the Nesterov accelerated gradient method, which is also described in our paper. The algorithm can also be reduced to a version of Newton's method, where the gradients are obtained from the Fisher matrix of the data. We demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm by numerical experiments.

In the absence of replication, it is difficult to ascribe significance to any given piece of research, and no one should be surprised if a given study is refuted by another study.
Unfortunately, the Covid-19 pandemic is not the first time that a widespread social phenomenon, such as the 1918 influenza pandemic, has been mistaken for a “crisis”. In reality, it was only a flu-like pandemic.
The “Covid-19 pandemic” is not unique to the USA, or even to the West. The clinical trial of the antimalarial drug chloroquine, for instance, was undertaken on the basis of a single study from Southeast Asia, in the early 1960s. Totalitarian regimes such as the Chinese “Communist�"

However, the origin of the causative pathogen is unknown; thus, this study investigated the origins of M. lepromatosis, a close relative of M. leprae, using comparative genomic analyses of the two pathogens. The study identified several unique mutations in M. lepromatosis, the majority of which are not found in M. leprae, suggesting that M. lepromatosis evolved independently from M. leprae. The study also suggests that M. lepromatosis has lost several metabolic functions, including those essential for amino acid biosynthesis and heme metabolism. These findings suggest that M. lepromatosis may have evolved an unusual lifestyle, and could have acquired its pathogenic potential by acquiring a distinct metabolic pathway. The study also suggests that M. lepromatosis may be a transition to the complete loss of the ability to infect the peripheral nervous system, in which case it may have become lost in the course of evolution.

There are many open problems to be solved, and the most exciting one is to understand the fundamental limits of the entanglement of many-particle systems in time. The most important achievement of the last decade or so has been the discovery of the fact that the noninteracting limit of many-body physics can be captured by the standard picture of the entanglement of a spinor, which is surprisingly simple. This picture is amazingly powerful and can be applied to many problems. However, the noninteracting limit is applied to a very special case, namely, a system of spinor operators. The noninteracting case is technologically irrelevant, since it is impossible to build useful quantum computers with such a simple picture. The case of noninteracting systems is a good one to get to know the basic ideas of quantum mechanics, but it is incomputable in general. Therefore, the aim of this seminar is to show the audience how to tackle the problem of the entanglement evolution in the case of interacting systems. We will show how to do this by using the"

COVI-VAC’s key benefit is that it requires a single-dose administration in the same way as is typical of live attenuated vaccines. In contrast to the development of an anti–spike monoclonal antibody, COVI-VAC is potentially suitable for mass vaccination, as it is manufactured using recombinant DNA technology. Furthermore, a single-dose intranasal inoculation with COVI-VAC induced robust immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in a relevant in vivo model.

However, it appears that the species that caused the epidemics is not the only one. Our results indicate that human fleas, and possibly other ectoparasites, may have also played an important role in spreading the infection.
Biology, epidemiology, history, and social history
When the Black Death first appeared in Europe, it was associated with rats, but by 1369, the epidemic had spread to people. Based on the historical record, the most plausible hypothesis so far is that the pandemic spread through the human population via fleas that were transported by rats. In particular, the Black Death rat (Rattus rattus) was believed to be the primary vector. However, the presence of a single rat in a house does not mean that it is the main vector, and if the"

We present a different explanation: The brains of the great apes are “only” six times larger than those of chimpanzees, but they have about ten times more neurons. This finding is the result of an extensive analysis of encysted neurons across all amniotes. The fact that our brain is not only the most computationally powerful of all animals but also that the relative increase in the number of neurons is significantly larger than in other groups may explain our exceptional cognitive abilities.

TRAP1 regulates the balance between mitochondrial aerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. We find that TRAP1-deficient cells show a metabolic switch to glycolysis, enhanced invasive potential, and proliferating-like morphology. Because cancer cells have high proliferative potential, this switch may confer a proliferative advantage to cancer cells. The metabolic switch to glycolysis, in which glutamine is diverted to the TCA cycle, is promoted by the inhibition of glutaminase, not by the accumulation of glutamine-rich metabolites. Thus, the ability to target glutaminase represents a viable therapeutic strategy for cancer.

Cancer is the leading cause of death in both developed and developing countries, and it is estimated that cancer will become the leading cause of death in the US and Europe by 2030. One third of cancer-related deaths are due to cancer metastasis, which is a primary cause of death in more than half of all cancer patients. Metastasis-associated cancer stem cells (c-MACs), which are characterized by an enhanced capacity to self-renew, self-propagate, and initiate tumorigenesis, are essential drivers of cancer development and progression. In the last decade, c-MACs have been shown to be involved in the initiation and progression of a variety of human cancers, including breast, prostate, ovarian, mesothelioma, and head and neck cancers.

This project investigates whether fructose stimulates appetite and food-approach behavior, and whether this effect is mediated by changes in brain function and/or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). We hypothesize that eating fructose relative to glucose will result in greater activation of brain regions involved in attention and reward processing and greater activation of the brain’s reward system. We will test this hypothesis by measuring brain activation and hormone levels during processing of food cues and during a decision task where participants are given an enticing, high-calorie food reward in exchange for not eating for 30 min. We will also investigate variability in the effects of fructose versus glucose across individuals based on genetic factors that have been linked to brain function and food-related behaviors.

We have recently argued that the ancestral radiation of aquatic mammals was driven by the need to limit thermoregulatory costs of swimming. We show that in most extant terrestrial mammals, including humans, the scaling of energetic intake and cost functions with body size are approximately the same in and out of water. This allows the evolutionary trajectory of body size to be determined by energetic costs alone, and favors the evolution of relatively large body sizes. In contrast, aquatic mammals, swimming in water, are constrained by the need to minimize thermally driven costs. In addition to swimming, aquatic mammals must metabolize food with greater efficiency than terrestrial mammals, because of the rapid dissipation of heat to the water. Because of the lack of a “free-living” mammalian model, the relative importance of this energetic constraint, and the consequences for body size, have remained obscure. Here we show that the relative importance of the energetic constraints of thermoregulation and feeding in aquatic mammals is higher than in land-dwelling mammals, and that this difference is the main determinant of body size.

This virally encoded miRNA is a major determinant of rhinovirus-induced innate immune response in the nose. We show that the full-length genome of rhinovirus can be transcribed in the nose, and that the enteric miRNA is required for rhinovirus replication at the airway–blood barrier interface. Together, these findings indicate that the nose is a major route of viral entry into the body.

It also reveals that astrocytes are the primary target of this amyloidosis-induced inflammatory response. The combination of transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of neurons and astrocytes in a preclinical model of familial AD, which are known to be highly enriched for the amyloidogenic precursor protein, unveils the complete molecular signature of the disease. The study reveals that astrocytes are the primary target of amyloidosis-induced inflammation, and that astrocyte-centric immunophenotypes are directly related to the extent of neurodegeneration. In fact, it is hypothesized that the extent of microglial activation and the subsequent neurotoxicity may be attributed to the astrocytic inflammation, since astrocytes are the major bystander cells of the diseased brain. In other words, astrocytes appear to be the most affected cell type, while neurons are largely spared from neuroinflammation. This immunophenotype is highly correlated with disease severity and provides an important avenue for future therapy.

The first is the canonical mechanism, and it is believed that the latter is associated with many thermodynamically difficult transitions. The monotonic-folding theory rests on the assumption that the intermediate states are not important. We have now reported the first observation of a complete protein folding transition. The transition is of interest because it combines the general requirement of a tumbling-rod mechanism with the unusual feature of a large number of intermediate states and a substantial time scale of folding. The observation is a result of the combination of a very sensitive and very precise mass spectrometer with the determination of the structure of a short peptide. We report the structure of a transition to the native state in a peptide by means of a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and structural analysis. The analysis of this transition has identified the first protein folding mechanism not associated with the tumbling-rod mechanism. This states that the folding pathways can be in some respects very different.

Here, we show that the RppH–mediated deamidation of capped RNAs takes place via two distinct attack modes, each involving a different nucleotide: the β-phosphate-dependent attack on the 5′ end and the δ-phosphate-dependent attack on the 3′ end of capped RNAs. This work reveals for the first time that RppH can recognize a variety of RNA structures, including an unusual δ-phosphate-enriched cap, and that it can deamidate them in a manner that is distinct from that of the previously described β-phosphate-dependent deamidating enzyme described for other organisms. This discovery reveals with unprecedented detail a mechanism that can explain the apparent inability of some bacteria to thrive under conditions of stress, and could also provide insights into the consequences of the evolution of the unusual deamidating mechanism observed in this particular organism.

After sepsis, a significant number of patients develop immunodeficiency, which is mediated by Tregs and MDSCs. We believe that Tregs and MDSCs are the major cause of immune dysfunction in patients with sepsis. We demonstrate that the mechanism of Tregs and MDSCs-mediated immunosuppression can be reversed using citrullinated arginine-deficient diet (“citrulline deficient”).

“The critical period” is an integrative concept in which critical events determine the biological outcome. In the past decade, the field of “postmating” processes has emerged, revealing a coordinated, sex-specific molecular orchestration throughout the fertilization process. Understanding these processes is key to controlling fertilization, gamete quality, and even the evolution of sexual reproduction. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the postmating life history of the sperm proteome in Drosophila melanogaster, characterizing the molecular changes in the seminal fluid and sperm after copulation. We detect a pronounced female contribution to the postmating sperm proteome, which is enriched in genes and processes related to sperm viability, motility, and development. These findings provide a mechanistic insight into the critical processes that are critical to fertilization success"

The big reveal: The most binding force on a human body is the strongest possible force on a human body.

We find that expansion of CO2-tolerant cyanobacteria throughout the fossil record led to the demise of carbonate-utilizing organisms such as corals and brachiopods. This phenomenon is not observed in the modern ocean. We relate this observation to the rise of the oxygenic photosynthetic biosphere, which evolved to use carbon dioxide as its sole carbon source and thus did not compete with carbonate-utilizing organisms.

However, the neurophysiological mechanisms that generate this complex structure have remained elusive. We show that brain activity in many language-related areas is modulated by the presence of a single word or multiword sequence, but that the effects of a word or phrase extend throughout the hierarchy of phrase structure until the very top. We find that the brain’s hierarchical parser is able to generate a bottom-up structure of the incoming language stream, and that this structure is reflected in the amount of distinctively hierarchical brain activity. The results suggest that the brain has evolved a mechanism of hierarchical processing of language, and that its implementation is based on the ability of the brain to “see” or “hear” the structure of incoming sequences.

However, if you are wondering about the fate of our species in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, the following anecdote provides some insights into this question:
Nanotransistor for the first time fills the gap in the study of the early evolution of life on Earth. The discoveries shown here show that the same basic building blocks of life are used by the most primitive living organisms, including the oldest, the “lonely” bacteria-like archaea, which predate even the prokaryotes. The first living organisms of this period appeared about 3.5 to 4.0 billion years ago. The ability to read and write DNA is not a fundamental character of life from this point of view. The discovery, on the contrary, gives a new perspective on the origin of life.

Though a recent study has shown that some dopamine terminals that project to the VTA project to the pars reticulata (prLH), many more projects to the pars compacta (pcLH), where they are projected to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Stimulation of the pcLH induces eating, and lesion of the pcLH reduces eating. However, the contribution of the prLH to eating is less understood. Here, we find that stimulation of prLH terminals produces feeding behavior. Lesions of the prLH do not affect eating, thereby establishing it as a downstream circuit element for LH neurons. We further find that activation of GABA neurons (that project to the prLH) in the peri-locus coeruleus (pcL) region produces eating. Lesion of the pcL does not change feeding, implying that the pcL is a critical downstream circuit element for the prLH, which we propose contributes to the regulation of eating.

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented demands for the development of vaccines and therapeutics. To address this need, the pharmaceutical industry, academic research groups, and academic-based nonprofits have set up “virus factories” that mass-produce SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. This process involves the transformation of cells in bioreactors. One of the most common types of cells used to mass-produce the virus is MDCK-K562 hematopoietic stem cells (hSC) because they are relatively"

Such abilities do not come naturally to them by natural selection, but are shaped by the spiders’ ingenuity, which is manifested in a variety of ways. In this talk, we will provide an example of this ingenuity that is probably not apparantly obvious to most: the spider’s echolocation. In many other animals, the auditory organs are intrinsic parts of the body, such as the ears of humans and birds. However, the spider, and indeed all arthropods, have no ears, eyes, or nose. Thus, the spider’s auditory organs, which are essential for sensing prey, predators, and mates, are not integrated into the body, but rather are located on the exoskeleton, in the form of a sensory array. The spiders’ auditory organs are not only quite remarkable, but also surprisingly sensitive, as they detect and localize incoming sound waves with the highest possible precision, to within a few nanometers.

We are witnessing the death and the birth of the Anthropocene. The first of these has been driven by the exponential rise in fossil-fuel-related CO2 emission, which has caused the atmospheric CO2 level to rise from 280 ppm in the preindustrial era to over 400 ppm today, and the consequent ongoing global warming. The latter is driven by the combustion of fossil fuels, nuclear fission, and biomass burning. These become more obvious when the rate of increase in CO2 level is compared with the growth of population and GDP. The only alternative way to counter it is also fossil-fuel-related: control of fossil-fuel-related CO2 emissions and control of aerosol-related perturbation of the hydrologic cycle. We have estimated the mortality from fossil-fuel-related anthropogenic aerosol pollution, and shown that it is twice as large as the mortality due to the fossil-fuel-related CO2 emission.

It is a dangerous mistake to assume that the only relevant choices are between two alternatives, “right” and “wrong”; there are many shades of grey. How we think can also be a function of the world we live in.
The social entrepreneur can be considered a sort of cultural engineer (Gardner, 2012) because the entrepreneur shapes the cultural environment in which most of us live; thus, it is important to understand what society thinks of entrepreneurship. It is a mistake to conceptualize society as a homogeneous mass, where everyone thinks alike. The majority of people are willing to tolerate and even reward entrepreneurship, provided that the entrepreneurs do not abuse their power. However, this is not the case in all societies. The US, for instance, has a long tradition of entrepreneurship, with a somewhat negative image of the “rich”, whereas, the opposite is true for many other societies.

I will present some of our work on using computational and experimental techniques to study the emergence of self-organizing behavior in networks of interacting agents, particularly in the context of emergent social behaviors. We found that a large portion of emergent group behavior can be explained by a simple set of rules. I will also present a model of iridescence in fishes, which can be regarded as a self-organizing system. We found that the formation of the fish’s iridescent skin is not a by-product of the work of many cells, but rather an emergent property of a few large groups of melanocytes that are able to coordinate their interactions in a self-organizing manner. We discovered that the melanocytes form the first self-organizing system in the fish, and they encode the iridescent pattern with the help of a small set of interacting genes.

Although the reemergence of plague in the twenty-first century has been largely confined to Africa, the ancient genetic diversity of Y. pestis has remained largely elusive. Here, we present 17 sequenced genomes of Y. pestis from five continents spanning the LNBA period spanning from 5,000 to 2,500 y BP, providing the most comprehensive study to date on the prehistory of this pathogen. Y. pestis had a single lineage that persisted for millennia during its evolution, without any major diversification, and showed rapid dispersal across Eurasia. This finding suggests that the genetic diversity of the pathogen was stable for millennia and that its emergence and spread into Europe may have resulted from factors other than the spread of fleas by humans. Moreover, the lack of pace-of-life evidence in the genome-scale analysis indicates that Y. pestis was not a rapid-evolving pathogen.

The implications are that, to maximize long-term productivity, soil health management practices should be selected and implemented with consideration of soil type.
Carbon sequestration is a hot topic in agriculture, and the soil is a key player in the long-term sustainability of food production. The soil carbon pool is a combination of mineral and organic carbon, with the latter being the more dynamic component. Organic carbon consists of many different forms, but a number of microbes are intimately involved in its decomposition. Inorganic carbon (C in the mineral fraction) can be used directly by plants, whereas organic carbon (C in the POM fraction) is metabolized and recycled to replenish the mineral pool. The soil C cycle is tightly coupled to microbial community structure, which in turn is influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, moisture, and nutrient availability. These factors also influence the rate of POM decomposition. Hence, soil types with higher C and lower water-holding capacity (e.g., Mollisols)"

The evolution of these signals has been driven by the interactions of plants with herbivores, and the chemical diversity they afford has been the result of repeatedly divergent selective sweeps, and even convergent evolution. One of the most spectacular examples of this is the evolution of carotenoids, which have been documented in hundreds of plant families, including the economically important coffee, cacao, and rose families, but which are found in only a few hundred species of the 1.5 million extant vascular plant species. A fundamental question for plant biology has been the selection forces that have shaped the distribution of these pigments. Here, we explore these forces by taking a closer look at the evolution of carotenoid biosynthesis. We show that carotenoids are key to the survival of xanthophyll-producing plants, which were previously thought to be a minor and transient branch of plants. We further identify four distinct origins of carotenoid biosynthesis, providing a broader insight into the evolution of these key compounds in plants and their importance for plant fitness"

In these ways, I argue that analysis of physical appearance can guide us to understand the most economically vibrant neighborhoods and their potential for further success, or their potential for failure.

“There is no spate of this or that to be worried about. We’re in the midst of a crisis due to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria,” says Dr. Michael Smith, an assistant professor of biology at the University of Amsterdam.

The ability to model disease in the laboratory is greatly enhancing our ability to identify molecular mechanisms of disease, causing, diagnosing, and treating neurodegenerative diseases. However, the current generation of motor neurons and astrocytes are not derived from ancillary parts of the organism but, rather, build up from a variety of sources, including embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells. This can compromise the representativeness of the cells, and might even introduce non-physiologically relevant activities, particularly because they are not derived from neurons.

However, the closest relatives of birds are the dinosaurs, and the original avian features evolved in various ways, some of which we know very little about. Based on a new find, we are able to better understand how the early bird lineage evolved.
The avian lineage split into two branches in the late Jurassic, with the clade that includes Archaeopteryx and its relatives (the “classical” birds) and the group that includes theropods, which would eventually become dinosaurs. However, the early “dinosauriformes” group already evolved at least two major lineages, with one focusing on leg and foot evolution and the other on the development of wings and feathers. The origin of feathers is a striking example of this mosaic pattern, as feathers show a complex history of developmental evolution. In particular, the origin of the main characteristics of modern feathers, namely asymmetrical flight feathers, is still debated. Some studies indicate that asymmetries were present in the precursors to modern feathers, possibly being a result of the development of"

The evolution of the troposphere and stratosphere is a complex process, involving a number of interacting components. The figure shows an example of the equilibrium-troposphere-atmosphere (TEA) amplitude spectrum, which is a measure of the temperature of the troposphere relative to the temperature of the stratosphere. This spectrum is a function of the temperature of the troposphere, the mean temperature of the tropopause, and the tropopause-troposphere lapse rate – the rate at which temperatures increase with altitude in the troposphere.

Carbon capture has been considered as a key element in the fight against climate change. The implementation of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has been hindered by the high cost of the process. The US Department of Energy (DOE) has identified three types of carbon capture technologies: postcombustion, precombustion and oxyfuel. This is because the combination of these three technologies can reduce the overall cost of carbon capture by up to 50%. For example, the postcombustion and oxyfuel capture technologies can be combined to produce a hybrid system. The oxyfuel capture technology can reduce the energy required for the postcombustion capture by up to 30%.

Big-data analysis of the past two hundred years reveals that the pathway to capitalism can be reversed by conscious regulation of the economy, which in turn can favor a transition to frugal capitalism. We call this path “democratic recomputation” (DR). DR leads to the “regeneration of capitalism,” consisting of three distinct phases: the creation of a democratic economy, the transition to the postcapitalist economy, and the transformation of the postcapitalist economy to a “postcapitalist society.”
We show that DR, as defined by the three phases, is a fact of history, rather than a hypothetical utopia. This is because DR is a consequence of the fact that capitalism, in its present form, cannot be sustained for long against the relentless pressure of the “welfare-state cartel.” We analyze the economic and political dynamics that have been shaping the economic system in the United States over the past two hundred years.

We report analyses of this century’s most comprehensive collection of known dating samples to determine the origin of the parchment. By focusing on the DNA extracted from the parchment, we can rule out alternative animal sources, such as rabbit, and show that the most common use of the last hundred years was the use of calf or lamb hides. However, this did not prevent the use of other animals in some manuscripts. We show that this may be due to a preference in the region for a certain grade of parchment, allowing the use of calf, lamb, or goat hides.
The history of the parchment of the Middle Ages has been a source of contention for centuries. The prevailing view for many years was that parchment from the twelfth to the fourteenth centuries, spreading from the Mediterranean to Northern Europe, was made from fetal veal skin. This interpretation was based on the fact that, among the available sources, the oldest and most important ones, such as the Bible, the Vulgate, and the Book of Kells, are made from this type of parchment.

The end of the Triassic-Jurassic extinction, also caused by a combination of an asteroid impact and global warming, is well known, but the Permo-Triassic boundary extinction, which was not caused by an impactor, is poorly understood. Study of a record from the Ediacara biota (the oldest of the non-avian dinosaurs) shows that the Permo-Triassic extinction was preceded by a long-lived (1,000 ka) negative isotope excursion in carbonate carbon, presumably caused by a major disruption of marine carbon cycle driven by the impactor or heat pulse or both. The negative excursion is associated with a major reorganization of the marine ecosystem that is marked by a widespread loss of taxa.

Using a knockdown of RORα, we demonstrate that RORα-mediated inhibition of NF-κB promotes intestinal homeostasis. The metatranscriptome analysis of the intestinal epithelium of Ror1-deficient mice reveals a dysregulated expression of inflammatory genes, which are required in the repair of damaged and inflamed epithelium. These insights provide a better understanding of the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases, such as colitis.
The most important observation in this study is that RORα depletion specifically promotes the innate immune response. This observation is in contrast with the effects of RORα depletion in many other tissues, where it promotes the adaptive immune response.

This description is based on the concept of a “pressure-induced electron gap”, replacing the traditional “electron affinity” concept. It is based on the fact that the strength of the nuclear attraction of the electron toward the nucleus is the most significant factor determining the electron affinity, while the electron density, and hence the magnetic moment and the strength of the chemical interaction between the electron and the nucleus, is governed by the size of the nucleus. Nucleus size is determined by the atomic number, and hence by the number of protons and neutrons. This implies that the electron affinity is invariant for atoms with the same number of protons and neutrons, while the nucleus size, and hence the electron density, the magnetic moment, and the chemical potential, is affected by pressure. This implies that under high pressure, the chemical potential, the protective or repulsive nature of the core shell of the"

We find that, while the total number of victims of human trafficking and sexual exploitation is not knowable, it is probably in the range of 200,000 to 400,000, with about 150,000 to 340,000 victims in prostitution and about 100,000 to 200,000 victims trafficked for other purposes. We estimate that the number of victims in prostitution in the United States is larger than the number of human trafficked for other purposes in all countries in the world combined. The United States is the world’s largest destination country for human trafficking victims.
Abstract: People are the most important resource of all economies, and yet there are only rough estimates of the number of people in the world. We estimate the number of people in the world using the same approach as the United Nations, the World Bank, and many other organizations, using a combination of censuses, surveys, and extrapolation"

While the physiological and ecological significance of the associated metagenome has been extensively investigated, little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which the host shapes the activities of these organisms. Here, using an animal-plant symbiosis, we show that a host-derived metabolite (i.e., chitin) is vital for the establishment and maintenance of the symbiosis and that the metabolite is catabolized selectively by the microbe. We also show that the cyclic sequence of metabolite availability and consumption is essential for the existence of the symbiosis. Finally, we propose that the metabolic regulation of the symbiont is similar to the genetic control of metabolic pathways in the host. These findings constitute a new paradigm for the mechanistic understanding of the evolution of complex ecological interactions.
(…) The idea that the host may regulate the activities of the associated microorganisms in a metabolically selective manner is in line with the “metabolome-centric view of the cell”, which holds that the chemical environment of the cell is the key to the regulation of the genome (Langmead et al"

Although the basic epidemiological characteristics of the 18th-century pandemic are well known, the timing and geography of the initial introduction are poorly known. Here we show that a single, large plague outbreak introduced the bacterium into four European harbors, where it then established a persistent and widespread population. This disease then spread to other parts of Europe via migratory birds, and it gradually spread to Africa and America. The disease was then maintained in Europe by the domesticated animal trade and the cultivation of fleas on farm animals. The first human plague epidemic in the Americas was documented in the 16th century, but our analysis of the historical evidence suggests that the disease was imported from Europe, and that it reached Asia by sea. As a result, the Black Death was not a truly global pandemic.

This was the result of the seminal work of Lewis Henry Morgan, who was one of the first to blend Darwinian and Lamarckian ideas in one theory of evolution. Although he was not the first individual to do this, he was the only one to do so in a comprehensive manner and to make use of it in a systematic way for understanding human evolution. His legacy is now taken for granted in many biology courses. To this day, there is a widespread perception that Africa is the origin of the human species.
In fact, the mitochondrial DNA of humans originated in Africa, but this date is just a taster of the past.

In the 1960s, it was shown that many bacterial gene families are homologous to human genes, particularly those in the metazoan ribosome-binding protein (RBP) gene family. We now know that the bacterial RBPs are critical for protein synthesis and that the antibiotic vancomycin (tetracycline isomer analog) reduces the rate of protein synthesis in E. coli by inhibiting the activity of the bacterial ribosome. We propose the existence of a cognitive and emotional analogue to vancomycin, a concept we call hyperactive inhibition. The RBP effector motif in vancomycin is a hyperactive inhibitor of the bacterial ribosome, whereas the hyperactive inhibition of the human brain by the “psychotoxin” PCP is a hyperactive inhibitor of serotonin reuptake. The “hyperactive inhibition” of the human brain by psychoactive drugs like PCP is a model for a general mechanism of mind control that is archetypal of the forcing agent hypothesis.

In many cases, the mutations have been observed in the virus, which are responsible for the emergence of variants of concern (VOC). These variants exhibit reduced neutralizing activity of antibodies and in some cases, vaccines against ancestral strains are no longer effective. Here, we demonstrate how geometric deep learning can be used to identify mutational changes in the viral or antibody epitope that are responsible for the reduced neutralizing activity. We also show how this approach can be used to develop antibodies against these variants. This has the potential to help fight and prevent future pandemics.

We quantify the time lag between infection and economic recession in the US by examining the relationship between the reported covid-19 cases and economic data as a function of time at the county level. The pandemic is a “time-varying confounder” whose effects are not only geographically heterogeneous but also asymmetric over time. We use a time-varying confounder to isolate the effect of the covid-19 pandemic on the economy. We show that the economic disruptions of the pandemic account for more than half of the US recession in 2020, and that the covid-19 pandemic is the leading cause of the US recession. However, we cannot estimate the relative contributions of covid-19 and other confounding factors to the recession."

We believe that it offers a unified framework for studying life, mind, and the universe. This framework is also in agreement with the well-established fact that the universe is a “self-organizing” system. It is driven by a fundamental law of information processing, which is thought to be ubiquitous for the universe. We show that this law is highly nonlinear and oscillatory, and that the universe is as such a “complex adaptive system”.

We used a combination of mechanistic, isotopic, and empirical analyses to synthesize the temperature response of soil respiration across the globe. Specifically, we found that soil respiration does not respond significantly to warming across the majority of temperate and boreal biomes, with a consistent decrease in temperature sensitivity of respiration beyond a threshold of ∼25 °C. In contrast, we find an increase in temperature sensitivity of respiration in the tropics, where soils are already warming at a faster rate than other biomes. Our results suggest that warmer climates may be more responsive to climate change, and that the relationship between temperature and soil respiration is context dependent.

Our finding of these genes and the characterization of the gene regulatory network provide a platform for a general reconstruction of the submerged photosynthetic lifestyle of the genus Candidatus.

The impacts of anthropogenic climate change on the frequency and intensity of droughts in the tropics and subtropics have been the subject of much debate, but the empirical and modeling evidence are often conflicting. This is mainly due to a mismatch between the resolution (resolution ≈ 300 km) of global and regional climate models and the regional and seasonal scales of observations, and the long time series of observations are often insufficient to disentangle the effects of natural variability. Here we apply an ensemble of high-resolution global climate models to assess the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the observed increase in risk of multi-year droughts in Southern Africa. We show that the anthropogenic impact is indeed detectable in the data, and that the risk of multiyear droughts is increasing by a factor of four to six in comparison to pre-industrial times.

Our work demonstrates that quick and easy access to news and information about social, political and economic phenomena is not enough. In the age of Trump and Brexit, the zeitgeist is of increased negativity, even if it is mostly “fake news” or “alternative facts.” The work is important for three reasons. First, for individuals, it provides insight into the extent to which the news media will be a mitigating force in understanding and mitigating the potential for political polarization and social division, or alternatively, a contributing factor. Second, it is a warning for the news media that they may be exacerbating polarization and division, which in turn may be threatening to the health of democratic societies. And third, for governments and new media businesses, it indicates the need for increased investment in mitigating the potentially destabilizing effects of negativity.

T-cell immunogenetic studies have revealed that the human genome hosts numerous rare, unstable, and inactivating mutations in genes that impact growth, development, and immune function. A new study of 2,500 T-cell receptor heavy-chain (TCR) variants in the Pedigreed TCRA/TCRB dataset revealed that TCR variants that encode for an inverted repeat (IR) have an unselected effect on the genotype-phenotype relationship.

We have found that, in human diseases such as Huntington’s, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s, the specific type of spread that occurs is important for determining whether spread is beneficial or detrimental. Our work demonstrates that different types of aggregation arise through different mechanisms, and these mechanisms can have very different effects on disease progression.
“If we understand how aggregation occurs, we can better understand how to prevent or stop it.”
We are investigating the mechanisms of aggregation in neurodegenerative disease, namely, how and why the spreading of devastating pathogenic aggregates occurs and how we can stop it. To do so, we use a combination of genetic, biochemical, and cryoelectron tomography. We are interested in how the nature of the spread affects the spread itself, as well as the effect of the spread on its host. We have recently worked on the spread of protein aggregates in Drosophila, and are expanding this work to human neurodegenerative diseases.

It is possible to inhibit viral infection and pathogenesis in humans by inhibiting the function of LTA4H via MTX’s antagonistic interaction with it.

NK cells are the most actively patrolling immune cells in humans, where they are activated and proliferate to attack virus-infected cells and tumor cells.

Cancer metabolomics is emerging from a long history of proteome-guided drug discovery. What’s new is that metabolic targets have been left out of standard cancer proteomics. We show that SHMT is an untapped cancer therapy target. SHMT is a serine-tetrahydrofolate reductase/isocitrate dehydrogenase complex, with roles in purine biosynthesis, cell proliferation, and cell death. There is extensive evidence that SHMT is up-regulated in cancer, and that SHMT inhibition is a nontransgenic approach to cancer therapy. Even more compelling is that SHMT-deficient cells have deficiencies in amino acid uptake, a defect that explains the drug’s efficacy in cancer. The simplest test of this idea was to develop dual SHMT inhibitors. We show that single SHMT inhibition is not sufficient to block the growth of cancer cells. Rather, dual SHMT inhibition allows the enzyme to perform its normal role in purine biosynthesis while blocking cancer growth. This result implies that cancer cells need SHMT-mediated purine biosynthesis to survive, and that dual"

The analysis compares the morphological data of plant fossils to a set of stringent constraints, including the earliest appearance of the eukaryotic mitotic spindles. The earliest appearance of the eukaryotic mitotic spindle of any size is given by the monophyletic Euphyllophyceae, which are relatives of the angiosperms.

This reaction is of fundamental importance to the biosynthesis of tryptophan and, more broadly, all of the so-called “vital’ amino acids, and the enzyme is a member of the largest family of α-keto acid oxidoreductases. We show that the reaction proceeds through a concerted process involving the formation of a imino-iminium formyl radical intermediate at the pyridoxal phosphate residue. This analysis provides insight into the reactivity of the pyridoxal phosphate residue in this important reaction and identifies the position and orientation of a key water molecule in the active site, a key control site for the reaction.

Using a combination of transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome mapping, we reveal that hypoxia induces edema by triggering at least three different mechanisms: (i) up-regulation of CRF and downstream signaling of CK2, which activates astrocytic apoptosis; (ii) up-regulation of CRF/CRFR1/AQP4 signaling, which triggers a massive influx of water into astrocytes; and (iii) up-regulation of ET-1 expression, which contributes to cerebral edema by activating astrocytic glucose transporters, leading to a massive uptake of glucose by astrocytes. We show that these mechanisms are independent of one another in different cell types. Our findings provide a mechanistic understanding of the pathogenesis of cerebral edema and suggest that the combination of the up-regulation of CRF, up-regulation of the CRF receptor, and up-regulation of ET-1 is a critical factor for the development of cerebral edema in humans.

We can also use causal inference and model selection algorithms to tease out the causal mechanisms of what we observe in the data.
The challenge is that the size of datasets continues to grow exponentially. For example, it is now possible to collect more than a gigabyte of data in a few seconds using the right tools.

Although the mechanism of β-cell failure remains elusive, recent evidence suggests a key role of innate immune system, especially of innate immune regulating protein STING, in β-cell dysfunction. Here, we demonstrate that STING is essential for maintaining normal glucose homeostasis by ameliorating insulin resistance and improving insulin secretion in db/db mice, which is associated with decreased expression of pancreatic transcription factor Pax6 in β-cells. Our data reveal a novel function for STING in the process of β-cell failure and provide insights into the pathogenesis of IDDM.
Impact: The present study demonstrates the importance of STING for maintaining β-cell homeostasis. STING is a crucial regulator of both innate and adaptive immunity and is also involved in the regulation of insulin secretion. The therapeutic targeting of STING could be an important way to prevent or treat insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.

The emergence of a pandemic virus depends on the rare ability of genetic recombination to generate a new virus strain or, in the case of a reassortant virus, an antigenic shift of the existing viral strain by reassortment. The recently reported genome-wide interaction of the prophage with the viral genome of the causative organism of the Spanish flu pandemic provided an entry point, not only for identifying possible viral packaging signals, but also for investigating the pathogenicity of the virus. We identified and validated a viral packaging signal that is unique to the causative organism of the 1918 pandemic and is required for virulence. We also identified a functional packaging signal that is conserved across all known viral genera of the Orthomyxoviridae family.

We found that the activation of YAP/TAZ by disturbed flow promoted endothelial proliferation, inflammation, and arrhythmogenic remodeling to generate atheroprone endothelial phenotypes. In contrast, inhibition of YAP/TAZ activity by morpholino oligos significantly attenuated the atheroprone phenotype and the size of atherosclerotic lesions. Therefore, we propose that inhibition of YAP/TAZ is a promising therapeutic strategy to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic diseases.

The current state of the art in the field of secure communication is based on public-key cryptography, which relies on the ability to factorize large numbers. This approach has fundamental limits, because the security of public-key cryptography is directly related to the security of the underlying factorization problem. A promising alternative to these limitations is the use of one-way functions, which are computationally difficult to compute and easy to verify. However, one-way functions suffer from the fact that they are not secure by construction. Therefore, it is necessary to devise new techniques to verify the security of one-way functions in an efficient manner. This talk will discuss recent progress in this area.

Under these extreme conditions, we investigated the metabolic and physiological responses of the coral Stylophora pistillata by combining in situ on-site sampling, ex situ laboratory experiments, and genomics.

Aqueous electrolytes have a large electrochemical stability window (ESW) due to their low lattice energy and high degree of singlet oxygen formation. Based on the large ESW of aqueous electrolytes and the variety of chemical engineering strategies, various aqueous Li-ion batteries, such as aqueous lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors, and gel cells, have been demonstrated. However, the"

Transcription factor repression in light of the ancient evolution of the soma-to-soma gradient signaling pathway: Devising an evolutionary-driven model of aging and regeneration in the CNS
“Many of the mechanisms that control the regeneration and aging processes of the nervous system are conserved among diverse animal phyla. Nevertheless, there is a great deal that we simply don't know about the genetics and signaling pathways that regulate the most fundamental aspects of these processes. We are taking a number of approaches to try to identify and characterize the conserved molecular mechanisms that appear to underlie these processes. The goal is to develop a mechanistic theory of aging and regeneration that explains what is known about these processes in a unified fashion.
In particular, we have been using the genome-wide distribution of genes that are differentially expressed in young and old animals as a proxy for the transcriptional programs that determine the fate of their cells. We have found that there are substantial differences in the transcriptional programs that control the behavior of these cells. We are seeking to combine these data with other studies to develop a unified theoretical framework for the regulation of the"

Transposition, often called trans-from-to, is rare in eukaryotes, but it is not zero. It is at least as rare as the reverse, transition-to-transition (trans-in) and may be comparable in rate. The genetic data are surprising. The rate of transition is much higher than the rate of transposition. The difference between the two is generally about 10-fold. The difference is even larger in the sequence of the human genome, where the transition rate is about one order of magnitude higher than the transposition rate. (This, of course, is a function of the size of the genome.)
The history of the DNA damage theory of aging and of senescence is much the same as the history of the free-radical theory.

In the context of alcohol dependence, it has been demonstrated that gut microbiota regulate appetite, food intake, and alcohol craving and intake, and that the dysbiosis that occurs in alcohol dependence is associated with depression. We investigated whether the gut microbiota could be a target to reduce or prevent the symptoms of alcohol dependence.

We show that the dicotyledonous parasite Cuscuta is able to induce flowering via FT, a small peptide-derived transcription factor in the photomorphogensis pathway. This FT can move from the shoot apex to the roots of the host plant, where it physically interacts with the promoter of the floral gene FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and activates its transcription. Interestingly, the same FT gene is conserved across all plants. This indicates that FT likely plays an important role in the flowering of different plant species. This study reveals that a parasitic plant can induce flowering in its host, and thus can control the flowering time of the host.

However, most lakes, including Lake Michigan, are dominated by smaller watersheds, and they collectively account for a disproportionate amount of total nutrient loading. This is because the small streams have higher bioavailability, which exacerbates the potential for nutrient enrichment of coastal ecosystems. We quantified nutrient loads and bioavailability for tributaries across the watersheds of the world’s fifth largest freshwater lake, Lake Michigan, including the continental United States. We found that the six largest tributaries (accounting for ∼70% of total loads) receive smaller contributions of nutrients and P in the form of dissolved inorganic forms, such as nitrate, than smaller tributaries. This is largely due to the biases of their catchment in N and P deposition, and the greater bioavailability of nutrients in small watersheds. These findings represent a new perspective on the proportion of nutrients that reach coastal areas via small"

In particular, it seems that many phenomena that we now take for granted in the natural sciences actually arise from a richly diverse set of underlying mechanisms that take up most of the space of possibilities. It would be a mistake to believe that this is a recent discovery. However, the fact that the natural sciences are only just now discovering these fascinating facts doesn't mean that they were ignorant of the underlying physics and chemistry for centuries. Indeed, it just means that the tools that we used to have were far less powerful than they are now.

A couple of decades ago, if you want to understand the behavior of a system, you need to be able to build a sufficiently complex and accurate model of it. This is a difficult task, so you need a lot of data, and you have to be able to understand what it means to have data on a particular system in a particular way. In the old days, most of the data that was available had to be collected by hand with"

Understanding of the mechanisms by which NMDAR-Ab cause such a devastating phenotype is still in its infancy. Here we use a combination of (i) brain recordings in affected patients, (ii) re-analysis of a large set of brain recordings in the ‘typical amotivational syndrome’, and (iii) a mouse model of NMDAR-Ab encephalitis, to provide mechanistic insights into its pathogenesis. We show that NMDAR-Ab–mediated microcircuitry dysfunction is the primary cause of the cognitive and behaviour deficits in NMDAR-Ab encephalitis, and that NMDAR-Ab–related circuit dysfunction is much more critical to the phenotype than the more commonly used ‘excitotoxic’ hypothesis.

Here we study an abrupt warming event ∼300 ka ago that is the most devastating of all episodes of paleotemperature excursion. The abrupt warming episode is associated with the middle of the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) and the largest release of CO2 in the Earth’s history. This episode, which was likely caused by a methane-induced runaway greenhouse effect, resulted in a recovery of the Earth’s climate to a warmish Holocene state, with average planetary–wide temperatures 1.5 degrees warmer and sea level up to 60 m higher than today. There were large-scale impacts, such as the extinction of 30 to 40 percent of species from the fossil record and the prevalence of anoxic waters. Our analysis of organic carbon in the deep ocean and of methane oxidation rates suggest that similar conditions could occur today.

To this end, we study how a mechanism-oriented approach to the evolution of the genome can be applied to identify the function of proteins/genes that remained conserved across evolution.
Encoding of these conserved sequences in the human genome by means of ancestral sequence reconstruction and mutational analysis of the human genome indicates that the human genome harbors a complex and essential role in the regulation of exocytosis.
Although the function of the human genome in exocytosis is not yet fully understood, we have found that the highly conserved histone-like domains in the human genome are involved in regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. The N-terminal domain of the human TCA cycle-related protein (TCRAP) has been identified as a major contributor to exocytosis. Interestingly, successive expansions of the TCA cycle-related protein repeat domain (TCAR) and its deletion in mice result in"

Here we review the implications of polygenic sex determination for the evolution of sex in a variety of species. In addition, we describe how polygenic sex determination can lead to novel forms of sexual dimorphism based on the relative abundance of different sex determination alleles in a population. This leads to the emergence of a variety of possible phenotypes, including atypical gender expression. Finally, we discuss whether polygenic sex determination allows for the evolution of genetic sex (genetic sex) or if it is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for the evolution of distinct male and female phenotypes.
Evolutionary sex determination systems are based on the presence or absence of sex chromosomes. In many species, a genetically determined sex can be assigned by a single gene, although alternative versions of this process exist. For example, in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the sex-determining gene “Y” (Y) is necessary and sufficient for male development. However, in many species, including humans, sex is not determined by a single"

The use of Fe chelators to inhibit Fe-dependent toxic processes has shown promise in the treatment of retinal degeneration in various pathologies, and the mechanistic understanding of this effect may inform treatment approaches. However, the retinal redox system is far from being understood, and it is not known whether endogenous reductants, such as heme and cytochrome c, are involved in the retinal degeneration of various diseases. Here, we demonstrate that Fe chelation by the chelator deferiprone protects retinal pigment epithelium cells from the toxic effects of the hemoprotein heme, which is metabolized by oxygen radicals to form the heme radical and toxic aldehyde products. Our findings indicate that redox processes, including those involving the Fe-redox couple heme and cytochrome c, are involved in retinal degeneration and that the use of Fe chelators in the treatment of retinal degeneration is promising.

However, the phylogenetic associativity between morphology and prey relationships has been revealed mainly by morphological studies of a single species group: the solitary and colonial box jellyfish. Here we identify and analyze this association for siphonophores by systematically characterizing tentacles of 45 species and fitting them to a phylogenetic tree using evolutionarily-weighted maximum-likelihood analysis. Our results show that tentacles with tentilla specialized for capturing jellyfish are adaptive morphological innovations and that this specialization is often associated with the evolution of feeding on jellyfish. Most interestingly, siphonophore specialists can be identified using morphological evolution alone. Our results show how morphological evolution is associated with the evolution of prey type, and they suggest that changes in morphology are linked to changes in mode of evolution. We also posit that the evolution of feeding on jellyfish has been a major influence in shaping the morphology of the tentacles of siphonophores. This insight is relevant for a better understanding of the evolution of predatory specialization and the evolution of morphology in general.

We therefore hypothesize that a regressive (“democratizing”) process in hand morphology occurred among hominoids during the evolution of the genus Homo, which was accompanied by an increase in tool use, tool making, and use of hand features as weapons. Here we report the discovery of a fossil hand from the early human ancestor Homo erectus from 1.42 Mya in East Africa, which bears the distinctive RSP characteristic of humans and is the earliest unambiguous fossil evidence for its presence in a hominin hand. This fossil is consistent with the hypothesis that the RSP formed a key component of a uniquely human hand.

In contrast to the cancer-specific SHMT inhibitor developed by our group, which is a broadly active cytotoxin, we demonstrate a highly selective, tumor-killing, chaperone-independent SHMT blocker. This kind of agent is needed because SHMT is a promiscuous enzyme, catalyzing the biosynthesis of polyamino acid-based molecules such as isoprenoids and purines. SHMT is induced in cancer cells when they are exposed to mitotoxic agents such as camptothecin and vinblastine, and it also participates in the Warburg effect of cancer cells. Inhibition of SHMT with a selective inhibitor boosts the cytotoxic dose of these drugs and a broad class of anticancer agents. In cancer, SHMT deficiency is associated with shortened disease progression. Thus, we show our compound is a candidate SHMT inhibitor that is highly selective for cancer cells and highly cytotoxic for them.
We have found that SHMT is of particular importance in the regulation of the anticancer effect of the anthracycline class"

A causal link was found between forest loss and reduction in household fruit and vegetable consumption, especially leafy green vegetables, which provided about two-thirds of the reduction in dietary adequacy. The magnitude of the impact is relatively minor compared to other socioeconomic and environmental impacts of deforestation, but it is reasonable to expect that a global pattern of deforestation will have large impacts on human health and nutrition in many countries.

However, our current situation calls for a broad understanding of the role of weight and movement on soil ecosystems. The main reason for this concern is that the weight of modern mechanized farm vehicles is approaching that of the largest animals that walked the Earth. Agricultural mechanization has greatly contributed to the increase in global food production, but a novel understanding is needed for mechanized agriculture in an era of global warming and environmental stresses. We quantify the impact of mechanized farming on the Earth’s surface from the first mechanized farming in the Middle East to the present day, revealing a trend toward increasing weight of farm vehicles and subsoil compaction effects on soil ecosystems. We quantify the mechanized farming load in different regions, and show that nearly two billion people are affected by chronic exposure to soil compaction. Finally, we show how mechanized farming has had a severe impact on large animals that roam the Earth.
