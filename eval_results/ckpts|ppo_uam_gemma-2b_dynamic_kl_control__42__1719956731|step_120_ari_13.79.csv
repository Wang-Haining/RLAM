How the concentration of the transition metal Zn2+ inhibits the proton permeability of the Hv1 channel in the acidic environment of the male and female reproductive tract is not completely understood. Using molecules of Zn2+ and the voltage clamp fluorometry technique, we have identified the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We have shown that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function, might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels, and may have implications for other proton channels.

This higher coefficient of variation is due both to an increase in the standard deviation of yields and a decrease in mean yields.

By analyzing DNA-based diet questionnaires of 122 species, we found that although carnivores consumed 73% of plants, herbivores consumed 99% of the plants—suggesting species coexistence. However, this high herbivore consumption was not reflected in species overlap, which was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. These findings suggest that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence.

These social-learning conditions were compared with an asocial individual-learning condition in which individual participants made repeated attempts at constructing a paper plane, without having access to any planes produced by other participants. Larger populations generated greater variation in plane performance and gave participants access to better-adapted planes, but this did not enhance CCE.

These data put APOE central to AD pathophysiology, but it is not yet clear how APOE alleles modify AD risk. We found that astrocytes, a major central nervous system cell type that produces APOE, are highly phagocytic and participate in normal synapse pruning and turnover. Here, we report a novel role for APOE in controlling the phagocytic capacity of astrocytes that is highly dependent on APOE isoform. These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes. They also suggest the hypothesis that APOE4 susceptibility to AD may originate from defective phagocytic capacity of astrocytes which accelerates the rate of accumulation of C1q-coated senescent synapses, enhancing synaptic vulnerability to classical-complement-cascade mediated neurodegeneration.

This study estimates the numbers of neurons in amniote brains and explores the scaling relationships between brain size and brain neuron numbers across amniotes. We find a broader range of neuron numbers in amniote brains than previously thought. We also show that reptiles have relatively small brains relative to body size but also relatively low neuronal densities, resulting in exceptionally high numbers of individual neurons. Amniotes have four major shifts in the numbers of neurons in their brains. Three of these shifts, which occurred in birds and mammals, make them better cognitive machines than reptiles.

In this study, we use single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques to quantify the action of ADF/cofilin in different mechanical situations. We find that local curvature favors severing while tension has no effect on cofilin binding. Remarkably, we observe that filament segments held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist, experience a mechanical torque that enhances severing dramatically. A simple model that captures our experimental observations indicates that the ADF/cofilin-induced torque increases the severing rate constant by an order of magnitude. We propose a mechanochemical mechanism by which this mechanism is critical to boost the ADF/cofilin’s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells.

The A1 domain in VWF binds to glycoprotein Ibα (GPIbα) on platelets, in a reaction triggered, in part, by alterations in flow during bleeding. The A1 and GPIbα domains participate in platelet binding to VWF. Gain-of-function mutations in A1 and GPIbα in VWD suggest conformational regulation. We report that force application switches A1 and/or GPIbα to a second state with faster on-rate, providing a mechanism for activating VWF binding to platelets. Switching occurs near 10 pN, a force that also induces a state of the receptor−ligand complex with slower off-rate. Force greatly increases the effects of VWD mutations, explaining pathophysiology. Conversion of single molecule kon to bulk phase kon and the kon and koff values extrapolated to zero force for the low-force pathways show remarkably good agreement with bulk-phase measurements.

The parasite interacts with a variety of proteins on the surface of the red blood cell. This work focuses on the interaction of the malaria parasite with a protein called EBA-175.

RORα is critical for maintaining intestinal homeostasis by attenuating nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) transcriptional activity. Here, we generate intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific RORα-deficient (RORαΔIEC) mice and find that RORα is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis by attenuating NF-κB transcriptional activity. RORαΔIEC mice exhibit excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model. Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis reveals that RORα/HDAC3-mediated attenuation of NF-κB signaling controls the balance of inflammatory responses, and therapeutic strategies targeting this epigenetic regulation may be beneficial to the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

The global carbon cycle is a key driver of global warming. We report the results of the largest global dataset to date of soil respiration, moisture, and temperature measurements, spanning nine biomes and over 2 decades of warming. Our analysis reveals that despite considerable scientific attention in recent decades, the overall response of soil respiration to anticipated climatic warming remains unclear. We also show that across all biomes, soil respiration rates with and without experimental warming follow a Gaussian response, increasing with soil temperature up to a threshold of ∼25 °C, above which respiration rates decrease with further increases in temperature. This consistent decrease in temperature sensitivity at higher temperatures demonstrates that rising global temperatures may result in regionally variable responses in soil respiration. This information critical to improving our mechanistic understanding of how soil carbon dynamics change with climatic warming.

Photosynthesis relies on these modified tetrapyrroles for the capture of sunlight and its conversion to chemical energy. (Bacterio)chlorophylls have an isocyclic fifth ring, the formation of which has remained enigmatic for more than 60 y. This reaction is catalyzed by two unrelated cyclase enzymes using different chemistries. The majority of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria use BchE, an O2-sensitive [4Fe-4S] cluster protein, whereas plants, cyanobacteria, and some phototrophic bacteria possess an O2-dependent enzyme, the major catalytic component of which is a diiron protein, AcsF. Plant and cyanobacterial mutants in ycf54 display impaired function of the O2-dependent enzyme, accumulating the reaction substrate. Swapping cyclases between cyanobacteria and purple phototrophic bacteria reveals three classes of the O2-dependent enzyme.

One answer may lie in the tendency for humans to react more strongly to negative than positive information. “Negativity biases” in human cognition and behavior are well documented, but existing research is based on small Anglo-American samples and stimuli that are only tangentially related to our political world. This work accordingly reports results from a 17-country, 6-continent experimental study examining psychophysiological reactions to real video news content. Results offer the most comprehensive cross-national demonstration of negativity biases to date, but they also serve to highlight considerable individual-level variation in responsiveness to news content. Insofar as our results make clear the pervasiveness of negativity biases on average, they help account for the tendency for audience-seeking news around the world to be predominantly negative. Insofar as our results highlight individual-level variation, however, they highlight the potential for more positive content, and suggest that there may be reason to reconsider the conventional journalistic wisdom that “if it bleeds, it leads.”

The virus requires spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. These findings unravel how sequential proteolysis regulates MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells and may explain why the virus uses receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to infect these cells. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. These findings may help to explain why two of the three MERS-CoV strains are more infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures. Finally, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence.

The genome is segmented into eight fragments, which offers evolutionary advantages but complicates genomic packaging. The existence of a selective packaging mechanism, in which one copy of each viral RNA is specifically packaged into each virion, is suspected, but its molecular details remain unknown. Here, we identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral genomic RNA segments of an avian influenza A virus using in vitro experiments. Using silent trans-complementary mutants, we then demonstrated that this interaction takes place in infected cells and is required for optimal viral replication. Disruption of this interaction did not affect the HA titer of the mutant viruses, suggesting that the same amount of viral particles was produced. However, it nonspecifically decreased the amount of viral RNA in the viral particles, resulting in an eightfold increase in empty viral particles. Competition experiments indicated that this interaction favored copackaging of the interacting viral RNA segments. The interaction we identified involves regions not previously designated as packaging signals and is not widely conserved among influenza A virus. The lack of conservation of these interactions might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses.

Simplified version: In all animals, the intestinal epithelium forms a tight barrier to the environment. Tumorigenesis on the microbiome using a Drosophila intestinal tumor model. We find that upon loss of BMP signaling, tumors lead to aberrant activation of JNK/Mmp2-signaling, followed by intestinal barrier dysfunction and commensal imbalance. In turn, the dysbiotic microbiome triggers a regenerative response and stimulates tumor growth. We find that inhibiting JNK signaling or depletion of the microbiome restores barrier function of the intestinal epithelium, leading to a reestablishment of host–microbe homeostasis, and organismic lifespan extension.

The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters approaches that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction.
Simplified version: Mechanical plowing is widely used in modern agriculture. With the increase in the number of farm vehicles, more soil compaction risk has been perpetuated. We show that while surface contact stresses remained almost constant, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions.
