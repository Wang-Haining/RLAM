Imidacloprid is the most widely used insecticide in the world, and its mode of action has been studied extensively. We show that imidacloprid crystallizes in a hexagonal ice II structure at high pressure. The structure of imidacloprid in ice II is made possible by the absence of direct bonding interactions between imidacloprid molecules and the host lattice. The results presented in this paper have implications for the structure of other guest molecules in ice II and highlight the importance of the host lattice in determining the structure of the guest molecule.

They are of great interest because they represent a transition in the relationship between the parasite and its host. We studied two species of myxozoans, Kudoa iwatai and Myxobolus cerebralis, and compared them with the transcriptome and genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that myxozoans are a sister taxon to the polypodium hydriforme. Analyses of genomic and transcriptomic data from the two species reveal that myxozoans have one of the smallest reported animal genomes. Genes related to development and cell differentiation were significantly less expressed in the myxozoans than in the polypodium hydriforme. Our results indicate that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content. This study contributes to understanding the evolution of parasitic protists.

One of these strategies is to block nuclear import of the IFN-stimulated transcription factor STAT1. We show that the virus uses its accessory protein Orf6 to localize to the nuclear pore complex in order to block nuclear import of STAT1. Our results demonstrate that the viral protein localizes at the nuclear pore complex and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain. We also found that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its antiviral function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. This study provides molecular insights into the strategy by which the virus evades the antiviral action of IFN. This knowledge may help to develop strategies to block viral evasion of IFN action.

Simplified version: Climate change has increased the frequency of heat waves. While crop breeding has been critical to increasing crop yields, increases in heat intensity may necessitate new and different strategies for crop breeding. Identifying the genes that predict crop tolerance to heat could be an effective strategy for breeding heat-tolerant crops. We identified and characterized 15 candidate genes for heat tolerance. Using artificial breeding to develop heat-tolerant maize, we evaluated the performance of these candidate genes in maize breeding. Our findings suggest that 7 of the candidate genes are promising candidates for future maize breeding.

This work introduces a synthesis, fabrication, and assembly strategy for digital synthesis of function-oriented structures. The proposed strategy can be utilized to design function-oriented and situation-specific mechanical devices for applications across domains.
Programming structures to realize any prescribed mechanical response under large deformation is highly desired for diverse functionalities, such as actuation and energy trapping. Yet, the use of a single material phase and heuristically developed structural patterns leads to restricted design space and potential failure to achieve specific target behaviors. Here, through a free-form inverse design approach, multiple hyperelastic materials with distinct properties are synthesized into composite structures to precisely achieve arbitrary and extreme prescribed responses under large deformations. The digitally synthesized structures exhibit organic shapes and motions with irregular distributions of material phases. Within the structures, different materials play distinct roles yet seamlessly collaborate through sophisticated deformation mechanisms to produce the target behaviors, some of which are unachievable by a single material. While complex in geometry and material heterogeneity, the discovered structures are effectively manufactured via multimaterial fabrication with different PDMS elastomers with distinct behaviors and their highly nonlinear responses are physically and accurately realized in experiments.

The same problems are being repeated, with new locations being added to areas where dams have already been built. The paper examines reasons why large dams have been built in developing countries, and some of the challenges associated with them.

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, women’s and men’s endorsement of masculinity predicted voting for Trump and evaluations of him, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government. These effects also held for evaluating his democratic challengers: Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020. As conceptualized, masculinity was associated with less trust in the government (Study 3), more sexism (Study 4), more racism (Study 5), and more xenophobia (Study 6) but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors.

We therefore compare the structure of the D614G spike protein to that of the wild-type spike to assess the impact of this mutation. We find that the D614G spike protein adopts a range of structural arrangements that may facilitate binding to the ACE2 receptor and subsequent structural rearrangements required for viral membrane fusion. The structure of the D614G spike protein is more complex than that of the wild-type protein, and the G protein contains a number of loops that are absent in the wild-type protein. These structural differences may contribute to the increased infectivity of the D614G mutant virus.

Estimating life expectancy at birth is an important public health indicator. It is used to evaluate the impact of policies and programs and as a general measure of health and well-being. It is also used as a tool to evaluate health disparities. An important question in the United States is whether the life expectancy of Blacks and Latins is lower than that of Whites. This question is relevant for several reasons. First, it is an important measure of health. Second, it is used as a tool to evaluate health disparities.

Simplified version: A humanized anti-IL1RAP antibody inhibits the proliferation of human AML cells and causes antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. IL1RAP is a target for therapeutic intervention. The IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RA) is expressed on candidate leukemic stem cells in the majority of AML patients, but not on normal hematopoietic stem cells. We show that monoclonal antibodies targeting IL1RAP have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and showed that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML.

However, the molecular mechanisms of EtdT-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis remain unclear. In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II recognizes and bypasses these regioisomeric EtdT lesions. We observed distinct pol II stalling profiles for the three regioisomeric EtdT lesions. Intriguingly, pol II stalling at O2- and N3-EtdT sites is exacerbated by TFIIS-stimulated proofreading activity. Assessment for the impact of the EtdT lesions on individual fidelity checkpoints provided mechanistic insights into transcriptional lesion bypass routes. The results from the present in vitro transcriptional studies are well correlated with in vivo transcriptional mutagenesis analysis. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II (termed Pro-Gate loop) that faces toward the minor groove of RNA:DNA hybrid and is involved in modulating the translocation of minor-groove alkylated DNA template after nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion. Taken together, this work provides mechanistic insights into transcriptional stalling, lesion bypass, and mutagenesis of alkylated DNA lesions."

Simplified version: Calcium carbonate production has long been recognized as an important role of scleractinian corals. However, it has only recently been discovered that this role is accomplished by the coral host.

This process forms a feedback loop, which in turn promotes the degradation of amino acids.

We identify multiple forms of inherent regeneration that are triggered by a physical lesion of the sensory axon, loss of neuronal activity, or regulation of calcium signaling. These connections suggest that this capacity is a powerful platform for gene discovery in neuronal regeneration. Moreover, we note numerous parallels between C. elegans and mammalian endogenous regeneration. Both forms of regeneration are triggered by lesion of a sensory neurite, are dependent on calcium signaling, and are enhanced by regulating L-type calcium channels or elevating cAMP. Taken together, these parallels suggest the existence of a previously unknown mechanism of neuronal regeneration that is regulated by calcium signaling.

In yeast, hotspots tend to occur in promoter regions of genes, whereas in humans and mice, hotspots are largely defined by binding sites of the positive-regulatory domain zinc finger protein 9. To investigate the detailed recombination pattern in a flowering plant, we use shotgun resequencing of a wild population of the monkeyflower Mimulus guttatus to precisely locate over 400,000 boundaries of historic crossovers or gene conversion tracts. Their distribution defines some 13,000 hotspots of varying strengths, interspersed with cold regions of undetectably low recombination. Average recombination rates peak near starts of genes and fall off sharply, exhibiting polarity. Within genes, recombination tracts are more likely to terminate in exons than in introns. The general pattern is similar to that observed in yeast, as well as in positive-regulatory domain zinc finger protein 9 knockout mice, suggesting that recombination initiation described here in Mimulus may reflect ancient and conserved eukaryotic mechanisms.

We identified resting states in healthy and disease subjects that were reproducible across healthy and disease cohorts. Time-course comparisons showed that the DMN was significantly reduced in advanced PD. This abnormality was partially corrected by dopaminergic therapy. We also illustrated that significant reductions in the network were already present at diagnosis.

This study reveals that more diverse communities can buffer the negative impacts of global warming on ecosystem functioning. In particular, the study provides evidence that changes in temperature increase the probability of species with thermal traits that allow them to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in thermal tolerance curves. First, more diverse communities have a greater chance of including species with thermal traits that allow them to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. Second, we found a pronounced increase in the contribution of complementarity to the net biodiversity effect at high and low temperatures, indicating that changes in species interactions played a critical role in mediating the impacts of temperature change on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species’ thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function.

However, the effect of certification on deforestation in oil palm plantations remains unclear, with limited research on this issue. This study combines multiple datasets to evaluate the effect of certification on deforestation in oil palm plantations in Indonesia. We found that certification was correlated with reduced deforestation. Nevertheless, most plantations contained little residual forest when they received certification. As a result, certified palm oil had less than 1% of the forests remaining within oil palm plantations. Moreover, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Thus, certification may have important conservation benefits, but its effects on forest loss and active fire detection rates are unclear. Wider adoption of certification in forested regions, stricter requirements for peatland avoidance and active fire detection, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations may be necessary for the certification program to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation.

These increasing stresses are now reaching limits that are detrimental to soil ecology. We propose a new global map to identify soil compaction susceptibility. This map is designed for use by farmers and policymakers, as a tool that can inform soil management decisions. The map can be used to determine the extent of soil compaction susceptibility in the country of interest.
