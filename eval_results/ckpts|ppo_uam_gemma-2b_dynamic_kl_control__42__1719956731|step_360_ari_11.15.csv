Nevertheless, the process of water hydrate formation is not fully understood. In this work, we first demonstrate that water can hydrate neon. We then show that the structure of the hydrate formed by neon in water is unique. We also demonstrate that this unique hydrate can be synthesized at high pressure and low temperature. The results of this work provide insight into the structural characteristics of the hydrate formed by neon in water.
Simplified summary: Neon hydrate was synthesized and studied by in situ neutron diffraction at 480 MPa and temperatures ranging from 260 to 70 K. For the first time to our knowledge, we demonstrate that neon atoms can be enclathrated in water molecules to form ice II-structured hydrates. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. Molecular dynamics simulation confirms that the resolved structure where Ne dissolved in ice II is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. The density distributions indicate that the vibration of Ne atoms is mainly in planes perpendicular to D2O channels,"

Because of the extreme reduction of the genomes of myxozoans, the evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a parasitic one is poorly understood. Our study provides insight into the extreme evolutionary transition of the myxozoan lifestyle. We analyzed the genomes of two distantly related myxozoans and compared them to the genome of a less reduced cnidarian parasite. Our results suggest that degeneration of the myxozoan body plan was accompanied by extreme reduction of genome size and gene content. 2022-01-30 2022-01-30 2022-01-30 2022-01-30 2022-01-30 2022-01-30 2022-01-30 2022-01-30 2022-01-30 2022-01-30"

These declines are partly explained by continued clearcutting on federal land. The NWFP stopped clearcutting on federal lands but has so far been insufficient to reverse bird population declines in older forests.

We introduce a new algorithm for training neural networks called fast iterative restarted networks (FIRENETs), which is stable and scales to large problems. We prove that NNs with a given accuracy can be learned by FIRENETs, even in problems with only O(|log (ϵ)|) layers needed. This algorithm can learn stable NNs with an arbitrary desired accuracy using only O(|log (ϵ)|) layers of computation. We support our algorithmic claims by numerical verification of NNs computed with our algorithm. We also present an inverse problem that can be solved with only O(|log (ϵ)|) layers of computation and show that these networks are stable.

Many animal species are susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. These animals act as reservoirs. Deer, the predominant cervid in North America, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Deer are regarded as a popular game in North America. Experimental infection of fawns can transmit the virus. We collected 283 RPLN samples from 151 free-living and 132 captive deer in Iowa from April 2020 through January of 2021. We used RT-PCR to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 94 (33.2%) of the 283 samples. Whole genome sequencing identified 12 lineages of SARS-CoV-2.

The drought began in 2012 and now includes the lowest calendar-year and 12-month precipitation, the highest annual temperature, and the most extreme drought indicators on record. Analyzing historical climate observations from California, we find that precipitation deficits in California were more than twice as likely to yield drought years if they occurred when conditions were warm. We find that although there has not been a substantial change in the probability of either negative or moderately negative precipitation anomalies in recent decades, the occurrence of drought years has been greater in the past two decades than in the preceding century. Further, a large ensemble of climate model realizations reveals that additional global warming over the next few decades is very likely to create ∼100% probability that any annual-scale dry period is also extremely warm. We therefore conclude that anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of co-occurring warm–dry conditions like those that have created the exceptional 2012–2014 drought in California.

ALS is characterized by the formation of intracellular inclusion bodies, which can be used to classify different clinical subtypes of ALS. Such inclusions are often composed of a large number of aggregated proteins. We show that the proteins that form inclusions of mutant SOD1, TDP-43, and FUS are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins. Rather, we show that the proteins that form inclusions of mutant SOD1, TDP-43, and FUS are supersaturated. We show that the proteins that form inclusions of mutant SOD1, TDP-43, and FUS are supersaturated even more than the native interaction partners of these proteins. Our findings suggest that inclusion bodies in various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable and prone to aggregation upon a disease-related collapse in protein homeostasis in a specific setting. These observations suggest that the protein composition of inclusions in ALS has a significant impact on the clinical phenotype. We hypothesize that the composition of inclusions in ALS is a primary determinant of disease progression. Hence, our findings have therapeutic implications.2022"

The acceleration of sea level rise is constrained by the ocean thermal expansion and increased precipitation processes, but the melting ice sheets process is unknown. These processes are by no means isolated from each other, but this analysis suggests that the acceleration process is driven by compensation. The compensation process is the result of a very brief period of negative ocean thermal expansion, followed by a period of positive ocean thermal expansion, followed by a period of negative ocean thermal expansion. The combination of these processes results in a gradual increase in sea level. This compensation is not observed in every year, so this process is not the dominant mechanism at any point in time. The ocean thermal expansion and increased precipitation processes are the dominant mechanisms in all years. Further, we find that this compensation process is not observed in the 25 y of TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter data.

Loss of intestinal barrier function leads to systemic infections. What happens to the microbiome when the intestinal epithelium is compromised? The present study demonstrates that tumorigenesis triggers the dysbiosis of the microbiome, which, in turn, leads to aberrant signaling and tumor growth. We show that inhibiting JNK signaling restores host–microbe homeostasis and extends organismal lifespan.

However, the higher capacity has increased risk of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remain nearly constant, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers. We derive a map with subsoil compaction susceptibility estimates. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land suggests a need for more stringent design of farm machinery. The paradox of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction stress is supported by a hypothesized relationship between prehistoric sauropods and modern farm machinery. Given the widespread agricultural use of farm machinery, our results point to a need for robust safety guidelines to mitigate subsoil compaction.
