To gain insight into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite, we analyzed genomic and transcriptomic assemblies from two distantly related myxozoan species, Kudoa iwatai and Myxobolus cerebralis, and compared these to the transcriptome and genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme.

Evasion of IFN-mediated antiviral signaling is a common defense strategy that pathogenic viruses use to replicate and propagate in their host. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 exerts this anti-IFN activity. We found that SARS-CoV-2 Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with NUP98-RAE1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex, and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the NUP98-RAE1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function.

Several mechanisms have been identified, including differential consumption of grasses versus non-grasses and spatiotemporal stratification in use of different parts of the same plant. However, the extent to which LMH partition food resources remains unknown because comprehensive identification of LMH is prohibitively difficult with traditional methods. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant LMH species in semiarid African savanna. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers: Grass consumption inferred from mean sequence relative read abundance (RRA) ranged from &gt;99% (plains zebra) to &lt;1% (dik-dik). Grass RRA was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of % grass consumption, indicating that RRA conveys reliable quantitative information about consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. These findings suggest that coarse trophic categorizations"

It is the primary site of blood interaction with the body and controls the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products between the circulating blood and tissue. To control each function, the endothelium receives numerous requests from multiple sources using multiple communication networks to integrate the multiple lines of information and coordinate endothelial responses. The nature of the communication network has been addressed using single-cell calcium imaging across thousands of endothelial cells in intact blood vessels. Cell activities were cross-correlated and compared to a stochastic model to determine network connections. Highly correlated Ca2+ activities occurred in scattered cell clusters, and network communication links between them exhibited unexpectedly short path lengths. The number of connections between cells (degree distribution) followed a power-law relationship revealing a scale-free network topology. The path length and degree distribution revealed an endothelial network with a “small-world” configuration. The small-world configuration confers particularly dynamic endothelial properties including high signal-propagation speed, stability, and a high degree of synchronizability. Local activation of small clusters of cells revealed that the short path lengths and rapid signal transmission were achieved by shortcuts via connecting extensions to nonlocal cells. These"

Simplified version: The selectivity filter and the activation gate in potassium channels are functionally and structurally coupled. An allosteric coupling underlies C-type inactivation coupled to activation gating in this ion-channel family. The allosteric communication between these gates is critical for determining channel gating. We have identified the second Threonine residue within the TTVGYGD signature sequence of K+ channels as a crucial residue for this allosteric communication. This Threonine to Alanine substitution at this position was studied in three representatives of the K+ channel family. Interestingly, all of the mutant channels exhibited lack of C-type inactivation gating and an inversion of their allosteric coupling (i.e., closing of the activation gate collapses the channel’s selectivity filter). A state-dependent crystallographic study of KcsA-T75A proved that, on activation, the selectivity filter transitions from a nonconductive and deep C-type inactivated conformation to a conductive one.

The results presented here demonstrate that many of the frequently cited natural products produced by microbial systems are not truly natural products and that, due to their variable structures and mechanisms of action, some of these “natural products” are more accurately considered to be “natural product chemistry” compounds. In addition, this work highlights the need to better define the term “bioactive compound” in the context of the chemical sciences.

The synthesized structures are rationally tailored through multimaterial fabrication to exhibit organic shapes and motions with irregular material distributions and specific behaviors. The physical implementation of the digital synthesis through heteroassembly creates highly complex yet programmable structures with dynamic responses that are vastly different but seamlessly integrated to achieve multiple target behaviors.
Synapses in the cerebral cortex perform myriad functions and facilitate neural circuit assembly. To achieve desired behaviors, neurons are mechanically integrated in various combinatorial configurations. This article demonstrates two aspects of combinatorial assembly: 1) via an inverse design method, a digital synthesis of a dynamic structure; 2) via heteroassembly, a free-form fabrication of highly complex structures. The combinatorial assembly of neurons in the digital synthesis and heteroassembly of neurons in the free-form fabrication yields highly complex yet navigable responses that facilitate desired functionalities. The two aspects of combinatorial assembly open new avenues for the design of functional neural networks.

This contradiction is referred to as the inner core nucleation paradox. Using a persistent embryo method and molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the metastable, body-centered, cubic (bcc) phase of iron has a much higher nucleation rate than does the hcp phase under inner core conditions. Thus, the bcc nucleation is likely to be the first step of inner core formation, instead of direct nucleation of the hcp phase.

The two-step nucleation scenario of the inner core also opens an avenue for understanding the structure and anisotropy of the present inner core.

However, current DL methods typically suffer from instability, even when universal approximation properties guarantee the existence of stable neural networks (NNs). We address this paradox by demonstrating basic well-conditioned problems in scientific computing where one can prove the existence of NNs with great approximation qualities; however, there does not exist any algorithm, even randomized, that can train (or compute) such a NN. For any positive integers K&gt;2 and L, there are cases where simultaneously 1) no randomized training algorithm can compute a NN correct to K digits with probability greater than 1/2; 2) there exists a deterministic training algorithm that computes a NN with K –1 correct digits, but any such (even randomized) algorithm needs arbitrarily many training data; and 3) there exists a deterministic training algorithm that computes a NN with K –2 correct digits using no more than L training samples. These results imply a classification theory describing conditions under which (stable) NNs with a given accuracy can be computed by an algorithm. We begin this theory by establishing sufficient conditions for the existence of algorithms that compute stable NNs in inverse problems"

The concept of the ecological footprint is not new, and the issues it addresses are probably as old as humanity. However, it is precisely this familiarity that is often used as a rationale for the lack of interest in what is essentially a very old problem.

Simplified version: Hydropower has been the leading source of renewable energy across the world, accounting for up to 71% of this supply as of 2016. This capacity was built up in North America and Europe between 1920 and 1970 when thousands of dams were built. Big dams stopped being built in developed nations, because the best sites for dams were already developed and environmental and social concerns made the costs unacceptable. Nowadays, more dams are being removed in North America and Europe than are being built.

However, the immunological mechanisms underpinning disease are poorly understood. Here, using a mouse model of AD, we demonstrate that neurons are the principal source of proinflammatory cytokines, which are implicated in the earliest stages of AD. We identify the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) as a significant proinflammatory trigger and demonstrate that neurons expressing Aβ can proliferate and release proinflammatory cytokines, even in the absence of tau or extracellular plaques. These findings suggest that the intense inflammatory response in preplaque stages may be at the origin of the neurodegeneration observed in AD. Furthermore, we identify the neuron in which the accumulation of Aβ is the most proinflammatory. This data indicates that the accumulation of Aβ represents the primary source of the earliest proinflammatory response in AD.

The intermediate is a highly structured, polyglobular state preceding the native state. We then determined the folding pathway of MBP using a combination of methods that include small angle X-ray scattering, high-resolution X-ray crystallography, and mass spectrometry. The folding pathway is hierarchical, with early steps involving formation of distinct structures followed by folding to the native state. The intermediates are present at all stages of folding and are characterized by a large number of segments that are highly protected from HX mass spectrometry.

The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally shows no C-type inactivation. We hypothesize that the BK channel’s activation gate may spatially overlap or coexist with the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter. We induced C-type inactivation in BK channels and studied the relationship between activation/deactivation and C-type inactivation/recovery. We found that the BK channel C-type inactivation occurred with hyperpolarized membrane potentials or with decreased intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) and recovered with depolarized membrane potentials or elevated [Ca2+]i. Constitutively open mutation prevented BK channels from C-type inactivation. We concluded that BK channel C-type inactivation is state-dependent. We propose that the BK channel’s normal closing represents an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation.

We show that the orb web has the potential to increase its sound-sensitive surface area beyond the spider itself by 10,000 times, facilitating the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously. The orb web has also the potential to be used as a novel acoustic flow detector for precise fluid dynamic measurement and manipulation.

We also show that the bacteria are responsible for the host’s ability to produce and store bioluminescent light in the absence of the bacteria. These results suggest that the bacteria in the gut may actively regulate signaling between the host and luminescent bacteria.

The biosynthesis of (bacterio)chlorophyll pigments is an ancient process that is of critical importance to the survival of the photosynthetic organisms. The bacterial photosynthetic process in which the precursor of chlorophyll is synthesized and the mechanism by which this precursor is converted to chlorophyll have remained enigmatic. We have identified a protein named AcsF that catalyzes a step in the biosynthesis of (bacterio)chlorophylls. The presence of AcsF in plants and cyanobacteria indicates that AcsF is a core enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of chlorophyll. The discovery of AcsF in cyanobacteria and plants reveals three classes of the enzyme based on their requirement for an additional protein, termed BciE, that we propose is required for O2-sensitivity. These results indicate that O2-sensitivity is an essential property of the enzyme catalyzing the final step in the biosynthesis of (bacterio)chlorophyll pigments.

Metabolomics and isotope tracer studies demonstrate effective cellular target engagement. A cancer cell-line screen revealed that B-cell lines are particularly sensitive to SHMT inhibition. The one-carbon donor formate generally rescues cells from SHMT inhibition, but paradoxically increases the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We show that this effect is rooted in defective glycine uptake in DLBCL cell lines, rendering them uniquely dependent upon SHMT enzymatic activity to meet glycine demand. Thus, defective glycine import is a targetable metabolic deficiency of DLBCL.

These proteins, including SOD1, TDP-43, and FUS, are characteristic of different neuropathological subtypes of the disease.

However, recent evidence from other neurodegenerative disorders suggests that disease-affected biochemical pathways can be characterized by the presence of proteins that are supersaturated, with cellular concentrations significantly greater than their solubilities. Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions of mutant SOD1, TDP-43, and FUS are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves supersaturated. To explain the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in the brain and spinal cord, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues.

Experiment 1 tested whether teachers (n = 39) could be encouraged to adopt an empathic rather than punitive mindset about discipline—to value students’ perspectives and sustain positive relationships while encouraging better behavior. Experiment 2 tested whether an empathic response to misbehavior would sustain students’ (n = 302) respect for teachers and motivation to behave well in class. These hypotheses were confirmed. Finally, a randomized field experiment tested a brief, online intervention to encourage teachers to adopt an empathic mindset about discipline. Evaluated at five middle schools in three districts (Nteachers = 31; Nstudents = 1,682), this intervention halved year-long student suspension rates from 9.6% to 4.8%. It also bolstered respect the most at-risk students, previously suspended students, perceived from teachers. Teachers’ mindsets about discipline directly affect the quality of teacher–student relationships and student suspensions and, moreover, can be changed through scalable intervention.

In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We observed distinct pol II stalling profiles for the three regioisomeric EtdT lesions. Intriguingly, pol II stalling at O2-EtdT and N3-EtdT sites is exacerbated by TFIIS-stimulated proofreading activity. Assessment for the impact of the EtdT lesions on individual fidelity checkpoints provided further mechanistic insights, where the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion. For the N3-EtdT lesion that disrupts base pairing,"

Simplified version: We describe the problem of “selective inference.” This addresses the following challenge: Having mined a set of data to find potential associations, how do we properly assess the strength of these associations? The fact that we have “cherry-picked”—searched for the strongest associations—means that we must set a higher bar for declaring significant the associations that we see. This challenge becomes more important in the era of big data and complex statistical modeling. The cherry tree (dataset) can be very large and the tools for cherry picking (statistical learning methods) are now very sophisticated. We describe some recent new developments in selective inference and illustrate their use in forward stepwise regression, the lasso, and principal components analysis.

First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with “invasion” theories of urban sociology.

We also discover that inhibiting JNK signaling or depletion of the gut microbiome restores intestinal barrier function, leading to the reestablishment of host–microbiome homeostasis, and organismic longevity. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of controlling the activity level of JNK signaling to maintain intestinal barrier function and host–microbiome homeostasis.

Although the function of Si in plant physiology has long been debated, its beneficial effects on plant resistance against abiotic and biotic stresses, including insect herbivory, have been well documented. The jasmonate (JA) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in mediating antiherbivore defense responses in plants. Potential interactions between JA and Si in response to insect attack have not been examined directly. To explore the role JA may play in Si-enhanced resistance, we silenced the expression of allene oxide synthase (OsAOS; active in JA biosynthesis) and CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (OsCOI1; active in JA perception) genes in transgenic rice plants via RNAi and examined resulting changes in Si accumulation and defense responses against rice leaffolder infestation (Cnaphalocrocis medinalis). In wild-type plants, Si pretreatment increased resistance against LF larvae. Upon LF attack, Si-pretreated plants exhibited higher levels of JA accumulation and defense responses. These results suggest a strong interaction between Si and JA in defense against insect herbivores.

We show that this adaptive mechanism underlies memory on timescales ranging from milliseconds to seconds. We demonstrate that this mechanism provides the basis for dynamic memory, which may be suitable for language-specific processing.
Simplified version: Language processing involves the ability to store and integrate pieces of information in working memory over short periods of time. Here we propose an account that memory is supported by adaptive changes in neuronal excitability. From these changes in excitability, information is continuously read back into the active membrane state for processing. This mechanism does not rely on persistent activity, inhibitory feedback, or synaptic plasticity for storage. Instead, information is maintained in adaptive conductances that reduce firing rates and can be accessed directly without cued retrieval. This memory mechanism is sensitive to context and serial order, which makes it suitable for temporal integration in sequence processing within the language domain. It also enables the binding of linguistic features over time within dynamic memory registers. This work provides a step toward a computational neurobiology of language.

Despite the massive investment in agriculture over the past century, many currently arable soils are now showing signs of subsoil compaction. Compaction leads to a reduction in the root growth and nutrient uptake capacity of the soil, with possible serious consequences for crop productivity.
Simplified version: Our understanding of the effects of soil compaction on crop productivity is limited by a lack of high-quality data. Here we present a global map of the distribution of soil compaction susceptibility that can help guide plant breeders and policymakers to target regions with high potential for subsoil compaction in future crop breeding programs.
Simplified version: We present a global map of the distribution of soil compaction susceptibility, based on test plots and survey data for 11 major crops, to help guide plant breeders and policymakers to target regions with high potential for subsoil compaction.
