Zn2+ is an important inhibitor of Hv1 channels. This study uses the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1 channels. The results show that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1.

We use DNA metabarcoding to investigate diet partitioning among seven LMH in a semiarid African savanna. Most species consumed only grasses. Species that consumed more grass were more similar in body size and digestive physiology. Grass RRA was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of % grass consumption, indicating that RRA conveys reliable quantitative information about grass consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in both body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in body size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages. Thus, additional research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie dietary partitioning among LMH.

Its function is to control vascular contractility, hemostasis and inflammation. To control each function, the endothelium processes endlessly arriving requests from multiple sources using separate clusters of cells specialized to detect specific stimuli. A well-developed but poorly understood communication system operates between cells to integrate multiple lines of information and coordinate endothelial responses. Here, the nature of the communication network has been addressed using single-cell Ca2+ imaging across thousands of endothelial cells in intact blood vessels. Cell activities were cross-correlated and compared to a stochastic model to determine network connections. Highly correlated Ca2+ activities occurred in scattered cell clusters, and network communication links between them exhibited unexpectedly short path lengths. The number of connections between cells (degree distribution) followed a power-law relationship revealing a scale-free network topology. The path length and degree distribution revealed an endothelial network with a “small-world” configuration. The small-world configuration confers particularly dynamic endothelial properties including high signal-propagation speed, stability, and a high degree of synchronizability. Local activation of small clusters of cells revealed that the short path lengths and rapid signal transmission were achieved by shortcuts"

The most dramatic increases in brain neurons occurred independently with the appearance of birds and mammals, resulting in convergent neuron scaling in the two endotherm lineages. The other two major increases in the number of neurons happened in core land birds and anthropoid primates, which are two groups known for their cognitive prowess.

We use previously published data on the body mass of 3,859 living and 2,999 fossil mammals to examine the evolutionary trajectories of body size in aquatic mammals. Phylogenetic analysis and the fossil record indicate that the evolution of an aquatic lifestyle is driving three of the four extant aquatic mammal clades toward a size attractor. The existence of this body size attractor and the relatively rapid selection toward this attractor rule out most hypothesized drivers of size increase. These three independent body size increases are consistent with control by differences in the scaling of energetic intake and cost functions with body size between the terrestrial and aquatic realms. Under this energetic model, thermoregulatory costs constrain minimum size, whereas limitations on feeding efficiency constrain maximum size. Rather than being released from size pressures, water-dwelling mammals are driven and confined to larger body sizes by the strict energetic demands of the aquatic medium.2022/2023/2024/2025/2026/2027/2028/202"

 SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. By January 2022, more than 400 million cases had been reported, resulting in over 5.4 million deaths. Based on genomic analysis, SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic virus. The virus is highly contagious, and infected people can spread the virus to others through respiratory droplets. People with COVID-19 can spread the virus to others before they experience symptoms. It is therefore possible that asymptomatic people can transmit SARS-CoV-2. The virus can survive on surfaces for several hours. In animals, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted to humans. We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 is circulating in free-living animals. If this is true, SARS-"

Gain-of-function mutations in A1 and GPIbα in VWD suggest conformational regulation. We report that force application switches A1 and/or GPIbα to a second state with faster on-rate, providing a mechanism for activating VWF binding to platelets. Switching occurs near 10 pN, a force that also induces a state of the receptor—ligand complex with slower off-rate. Force greatly increases the effects of VWD mutations, explaining pathophysiology.

The improved polymerase ribozyme is able to synthesize a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and, in low yield, even tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR.

We find a common Bantu and Austronesian descent for all Malagasy individuals, including those with a limited paternal contribution from Europe and the Middle East. Admixture and demographic growth happened recently, suggesting a rapid settlement of Madagascar during the last millennium. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, there are geographic influences on the present genomic diversity, independent of the admixture, showing that a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations.

Mutations in STIM1 result in a Stormorken syndrome of thrombocytopenia, bleeding diathesis, miosis, and tubular aggregate myopathy but without hematological abnormalities. Here, we identify gain-of-function mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of STIM1 and ORAI1 that result in constitutive activation of the CRAC channel. These gain-of-function mutations inhibit the slow Ca2+-dependent inactivation of the CRAC channel.

Experiment 1 tested whether teachers (n = 39) could be encouraged to adopt an empathic rather than punitive mindset about discipline—to value students’ perspectives and sustain positive relationships while encouraging better behavior. Experiment 2 tested whether an empathic response to misbehavior would sustain students’ (n = 302) respect for teachers and motivation to behave well in class. These hypotheses were confirmed. Finally, a randomized field experiment tested a brief, online intervention to encourage teachers to adopt an empathic mindset about discipline. Evaluated at five middle schools in three districts (Nteachers = 31; Nstudents = 1,682), this intervention halved year-long student suspension rates from 9.6% to 4.8%. It also bolstered respect the most at-risk students, previously suspended students, perceived from teachers. Teachers’ mindsets about discipline directly affect the quality of teacher–student relationships and student suspensions and, moreover, can be changed through scalable intervention.

We found that increasing the proportion of plant-based meals available at cafeterias by doubling the proportion of vegetarian options would increase sales of plant-based meals by 61.8% and decrease meat meal sales by 39.5%.

We provide a comprehensive design-based analysis of the effect of universal vote-by-mail—a policy under which every voter is mailed a ballot in advance of the election—on electoral outcomes. We collect data from 1996 to 2018 on all three US states that implemented universal vote-by-mail in a staggered fashion across counties, allowing us to use a difference-in-differences design at the county level to estimate causal effects. We find that 1) universal vote-by-mail does not appear to affect either party’s share of turnout, 2) universal vote-by-mail does not appear to increase either party’s vote share, and 3) universal vote-by-mail modestly increases overall average turnout rates, in line with previous estimates.

Palm oil production is responsible for substantial tropical forest loss. Sustainable certification is the tool most frequently used to fulfill these policies.

Strict requirements to avoid all peat and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation.
The impact of sustainability certification on the reduction of tropical deforestation in palm oil plantations has been studied with a wide range of methodologies. However, the causal effects of certification remain unclear.

We demonstrate that mechanical limits on compaction are being exceeded in many locations, threatening the productivity of agricultural soils. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for improved agricultural machinery design. We demonstrate that the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth. As the weight of modern farm vehicles is now approaching that of the sauropods, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming by prehistoric sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern agricultural machinery, suggesting that ecological strategies for reducing compaction must be considered in the design of agricultural machines.
Simplified version: Although farm machinery has greatly increased soil productivity, it may be exceeding the intrinsic mechanical limits of the soil in some locations. We present a global map for delineating subsoil compaction risk based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions.
