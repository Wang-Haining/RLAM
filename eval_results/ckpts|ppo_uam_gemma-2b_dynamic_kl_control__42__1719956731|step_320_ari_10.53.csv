Cryo-electron microscopy has allowed us to resolve the structure of ice II hydrates. Because of the abundance of water molecules in the Earth’s crust, the identification of the structures of hydrate is crucial for understanding the processes that occur in the Earth’s crust. The structure of ice II hydrates is formed by tetrahedral water molecules, but how the guest atoms can be enclathrated in water is still unclear. Using a combination of in situ neutron diffraction and molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the guest atoms can be enclathrated in the water molecules.

This paper uses a global crop model to estimate how climate variability and temperature change will affect crop yields and variability and economic stability of the world’s major maize exporting countries. We find that as the global mean temperature increases, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation of maize yields will increase almost everywhere to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the SD of yields and a decrease in mean yields. For the top four maize-exporting countries, which account for 87% of global maize exports, we find that the probability that they have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes.

However, the evolutionary history of beetles remains poorly understood. Phylogenetic analysis of 146 beetles suggests that beetles diversified on land during the Carboniferous. Moreover, the extensive use of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) by beetles may have facilitated the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles. In addition, the first appearance of PCWDEs coincided with the diversification of beetles. PCWDEs thus appear to have been a key factor in their diversification. Several species of beetles, including several economically important species, are strongly associated with anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Using three lines of evidence, we demonstrate that beetles play a role in the global greenhouse gas cycle by emitting CO2 from the insect gut. These beetles may therefore play an important role in climate change.

However, to get a less biased picture of comparative evolution, we should compare brains not by mass but by numbers of neurons. The present study analyses the evolution of the amniote neural system, as no other study has done. We show that reptiles have not only small brains relative to body size but also low neuronal densities. The results suggest that amniote brains evolved through four major shifts in neuronal numbers. Two of these changes are related to the evolution of birds and mammals. The other two are related to the evolution of the two most cognitively powerful groups of amniotes, anthropoid primates and land birds. This study also reveals that relative brain size is associated with relative neuronal cell density in reptiles but not other amniotes.

Nowadays, more dams are being removed in North America and Europe than are being built. This paper studies the proliferation of large dams in developing countries and the importance of incorporating climate change into considerations of whether to build a dam. We also address the overestimation of benefits and underestimation of costs, along with changes that are needed to address the legitimate social and environmental concerns of people living in areas where dams are planned.

We anticipate that efforts to understand the molecular “hand-off” between sperm and the FRT will lead to improved reproductive outcomes for many species.
Females are required for spermatozoa to complete maturation. In Drosophila, sperm maturation is completed after copulation. This is important because sperm maturation is needed for fertilization. Since fertilization is the final stage in the life cycle of most species, it is imperative to understand the relationship between sperm and the female reproductive tract. Although the maturation process is critical, the molecular and functional changes that occur during maturation are poorly understood.

Y. pestis genomes recovered from the Eurasian Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age (LNBA) period have uncovered key evolutionary steps that led to its emergence from a Yersinia pseudotuberculosis-like progenitor. These findings reveal the dynamic nature of plague’s formative years, which may be less understood due to a lack of ancient genomes.

We use public health data to estimate life expectancy at birth and at age 65 y for 2020, for the total US population and by race and ethnicity. We also project life expectancy at age 65 y for 2021. Our estimates suggest that the Black and Latino populations are estimated to experience declines in life expectancy at birth of 3.0 y and 2.1 y, respectively, both of which are several times the 0.87-y reduction for Whites. These projections imply an increase in the Black−White life expectancy gap of over 40% and reduce the Latino mortality advantage, which has persisted since 2006, to less than 1 y.

It causes epidemics and pandemics. Influenza A viruses are segmented into eight RNA fragments. Their genome is packaged into each virion. We identified a direct intermolecular interaction between two viral RNA fragments of an avian influenza A virus. This interaction is required for optimal viral replication. Disrupting this interaction does not affect the HA titer of the mutant viruses, suggesting that the same amount of viral particles was produced. However, it nonspecifically decreases the amount of viral RNA in the viral particles. This interaction is likely to be widely conserved among influenza A viruses. In addition, we identified regions not previously designated as packaging signals. Taken together, our results indicate that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome by forming a sequence-dependent supramolecular network of interactions. This network is likely to be widely conserved among influenza A viruses. The lack of conservation of these interactions might limit genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses. Understanding this network could help elucidate mechanisms of RNA packaging during virus assembly.

We conducted a large-scale experiment to show that this is true. Clicking is one of the most robust metaphors for social connection. But how do we know when two people “click”? We asked pairs of friends and strangers to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected. Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsiveness: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. Finally, we demonstrate that this signal is used by third-party listeners as a heuristic of how well people are connected: Conversations with faster response times were perceived as more connected than the same conversations with"

This study focuses on forests as a potential “win–win” opportunity to meet goals of improving food and nutrition security. We show that deforestation is correlated with poorer diets. Further, we find that forests are often overlooked in strategies to improve food and nutrition security. Thus, we ask how much forests might be able to help improve nutrition diversity, and thus, food and nutrition security. The study also emphasizes the importance of including forest landscapes in strategies to meet food and nutrition security.
Simplified version: the study finds a causal link between deforestation and poorer diets. The study also identifies the need to include forest landscapes in strategies to meet food and nutrition security. The findings have implications for policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition.2021–2022 (2021–2022)

We show that the rate of compaction has increased with mechanization. This trend has resulted in subsoil compaction risks exceeding safe mechanical limits. We propose a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility. Our analysis highlights the need for more stringent design of farm machinery to reduce subsoil compaction.
Mechanization has greatly contributed to the success of modern agriculture, with vastly expanded food production capabilities. However, the increase in capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights. A key benefit of modern farm machinery is the ability to till deeper soil layers. This has allowed for increased planted area and productivity. However, the increase in vehicle weights has resulted in more severe soil compaction. Soil compaction results in increased soil resistance to plant growth, reducing crop yields.
This article focuses on soil compaction due to modern farm machinery. Its effects on crop yields are presented.
Soil compaction has been a persistent problem associated with mechanization. We propose a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility. Our analysis highlights the need for more stringent design of farm machinery.
