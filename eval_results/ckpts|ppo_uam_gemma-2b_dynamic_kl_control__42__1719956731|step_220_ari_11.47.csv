Our mechanistic studies reveal a viral strategy to evade IFN-mediated antiviral signaling. ABSTRACT Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that is a serious global health problem. Evasion of IFN-mediated antiviral signaling is a common strategy that pathogenic viruses use to replicate and propagate in their host. We show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). In addition, we found that the viral accessory protein ORF6 exerts this anti-IFN activity. We found that SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we showed that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs ORF6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex"

The endothelium processes and integrates information from multiple sources. A well-developed communication network exists among cells that receives and integrates information from diverse sources. The nature of this network has been addressed using single-cell calcium imaging across thousands of endothelial cells in intact blood vessels. High correlations occurred in clusters of cells. Short-path communication between clusters of cells was established by connecting them via “shortcuts.” Local activation of these short-path clusters of cells revealed a network topology that was characteristic of a small-world configuration. This configuration confers dynamic and robust communication between cells and high signal-propagation speed.

It is a human pathogen that causes diffuse lepromatous leprosy. Genetic comparison of the Mycobacterium lepromatosis genome with that of M. leprae revealed that both bacilli have retained approximately 80% of their genes. However, a comparison of the enzymatic functions of the two bacilli revealed that M. lepromatosis has lost several enzymes required for protein synthesis. This finding suggests that the two species may be highly similar in their pathophysiology.

However, current inhibitors cannot distinguish between HSP90 and TRAP1, making their utility as probes of TRAP1-specific function questionable. Some cancers express less TRAP1 than do their normal tissue counterparts, suggesting that TRAP1 function in mitochondria of normal and transformed cells is more complex than previously appreciated. We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 silencing/overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species.

These intermediates are either known or predicted to be of a size suitable for X-ray structural analysis. Many of these proteins fold through distinct pathways. In some cases, the intermediates are relatively stable, and in other cases, they are unstable.
Kinetic folding of the large two-domain maltose binding protein (MBP; 370 residues) was studied at high structural resolution by an advanced hydrogen-exchange pulse-labeling mass-spectrometry method (HX MS). Dilution into folding conditions initiates a fast molecular collapse into a polyglobular conformation (&lt;20 ms), determined by various methods including small angle X-ray scattering. The compaction produces a structurally heterogeneous state with widespread low-level HX protection and spectroscopic signals that match the equilibrium melting posttransition-state baseline. In a much slower step (7-s time constant), all of the MBP molecules, although initially heterogeneously structured, form the same distinct helix plus sheet folding intermediate with the same time constant. The intermediate is composed of segments that are distant in the MBP sequence but adjacent in the native protein where they close"

They also suggest that the brain may extract meaning from the syntax of language.2022/20232022/2023 The study of language and its neural implementation has been a focus of interest for many researchers. While many of these models are of a bottom-up or top-down nature, few have focused on the merging of phrases as the underlying neural implementation of language comprehension. Here, we investigate whether the brain performs this complex task. We focus on the left hemisphere of the brain, where the most pronounced effect of processing one word at a time is found. This effect is pronounced in a broad set of language-related areas, including the superior temporal and inferior frontal cortices. We find that each additional word or multiword phrase contributed a similar amount of additional brain activity. Our findings suggest that the brain compresses syntactically well-formed sequences of words into a hierarchy of nested phrases.

We propose a method to predict the pressure-induced electronic structure of atoms and molecules. We predict the chemical stability of several elements.
Abundant evidence has shown the emergence of exotic chemical phenomena under high pressure. This includes the formation of unexpected compounds and strange crystal structures. In many cases, there is no convincing explanation for these phenomena. Here, we calculate, as a function of pressure, two central chemical properties of atoms, electronegativity and chemical hardness, which can be seen as the first- and second-order chemical potentials. We find that for most elements, chemical hardness and electronegativity decrease with pressure, consistent with pressure-induced metallization. Furthermore, we discover that pressure-induced s-d orbital transfer makes Ni, Pd, and Pt “pseudo–noble-gas” atoms with a closed d-shell configuration, and the elements preceding them (Fe and, especially, Co, Rh, and Ir) electron acceptors, while the elements right after them (Cu, Ag, Zn, and Cd) become highly electropositive. We show the explicative and predictive power of our electronegativity and chemical hardness scales. We predict the chemical"

This is because the interplay of socioeconomic and land use governance is poorly understood. We show that the effects of human activity on fire activity are complex, with changes in socioeconomic systems offsetting or exacerbating fire activity. This ranges from climate change and land use change, to how fire is suppressed by human activity.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a disease that is caused by a defective myeloid progenitor cell (MPC) that is characterized by a poor prognosis. We show that a monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) has strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML and that IL1RAP-deficient MPCs are more sensitive to chemotherapy than are MPCs with working IL1RAP. Hence, we identify IL1RAP as a target for antibodies targeting human leukemic cells. In addition, we show that antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity is an efficient mode of action for the anti-IL1RAP antibody. Finally, we show that the antibody is capable of blocking IL-1 signaling. Collectively, these results provide evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based therapy of AML.

A critical cellular and molecular mechanism of neuroinflammation in EAE remains unknown. We generated cell-type–specific conditional knockout mice to study the roles of ASK1 in EAE. We found that ASK1 deficiency in microglia/macrophages and astrocytes reduced neuroinflammation severity. ASK1 activity in microglia/macrophages exacerbates disease severity by inducing a proinflammatory environment. Astrocyte-specific ASK1 ablation promotes disease progression. Thus, our findings suggest a promising therapeutic target for reducing neuroinflammation.

One answer may lie in the tendency for humans to react more strongly to negative than positive information. “Negativity biases” in human cognition and behavior are well documented, but existing research is based on small Anglo-American samples and stimuli that are only tangentially related to our political world. This work accordingly reports results from a 17-country, 6-continent experimental study examining psychophysiological reactions to real video news content. Results offer the most comprehensive cross-national demonstration of negativity biases to date, but they also serve to highlight considerable individual-level variation in responsiveness to news content. Insofar as our results make clear the pervasiveness of negativity biases on average, they help account for the tendency for audience-seeking news around the world to be predominantly negative. Insofar as our results highlight individual-level variation, however, they highlight the potential for more positive content, and suggest that there may be reason to reconsider the conventional journalistic wisdom that “if it bleeds, it leads.”

Here, we identified a molecular interaction between two viral RNA segments and demonstrated that this interaction is required for optimal viral replication. Using silent trans-complementary mutants, we found that this interaction takes place in infected cells and is necessary for optimal viral replication. Disrupting the interaction resulted in a higher amount of viral RNA in the viral particles, indicating a potential non-specific infection of empty viral particles. Competition experiments showed that this interaction favored copackaging of the interacting viral RNA segments. The interaction we identified involves regions not previously designated as packaging signals, and this suggests that viral RNA segments can promote the selective packaging of the influenza A virus genome. This could potentially lead to genetic reassortment between divergent influenza A viruses.

The breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis is thought to be driven by the changes in the nutrient fluxes. Our study shows that the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis is driven by altered nutrient cycling during heat stress. We propose that these processes contribute to the breakdown of the symbiosis. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host. Our findings may help to uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general.

In the mature mammalian CNS, injury triggers a multifaceted process of neuronal growth and remodeling. This process is driven by the synthesis of neurotrophin-dependent growth factors and calcium signaling. Calcium signaling is mediated by the small G protein DLK/DLK-1, an activity-dependent MAPK. The current study reports a form of ectopic neuronal outgrowth that is independent of DLK-1/DLK. In C. elegans, this form of ectopic outgrowth is triggered by physical lesion of a sensory neuron, calcium signaling, or a mutation that limits outgrowth during neuronal maturation. These connections suggest that ectopic outgrowth represents a powerful platform for gene discovery in neuronal regeneration. We also note numerous similarities between C. elegans ectopic outgrowth and lesion conditioning, a phenomenon producing robust neuronal regeneration in the mammalian CNS. Taken together, our findings provide novel insights into the regulation of neuronal regeneration.2022-08-132022-07-30

Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if certification is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation.

Surface contact stresses have increased since the introduction of modern farm machinery. However, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map to evaluate the risk of subsoil compaction susceptibility. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land calls for more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. The increasing weight of modern farm machinery is reminiscent of prehistoric sauropods roaming the Earth.
