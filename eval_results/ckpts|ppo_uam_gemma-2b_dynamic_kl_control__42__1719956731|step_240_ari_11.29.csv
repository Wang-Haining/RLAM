Evasion of interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral signaling is a common defense strategy that pathogenic viruses use to propagate and replicate in their host. Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein ORF6 is able to block nuclear translocation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). We show that the viral accessory protein ORF6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) to disrupt docking of karyopherin/importin complex. In addition, we show that a viral protein ORF6-m58R impairs ORF6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravels a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN. Our findings unveil the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 antagonism of the IFN response. This knowledge will allow better understanding of the viral mechanism of action and its behavior in the host.

We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

DNA metabarcoding revealed that diet breadth, composition, and overlap varied widely across species. Dietary overlap was most pronounced between species that were similar in body size, digestive physiology, and location. Nonetheless, species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption consumed different plant species. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages. This study indicates that understanding LMH coexistence may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently acknowledged. Our results suggest that, despite common thinking, LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. Understanding plant diversity may be more critical than previously recognized to understanding LMH coexistence. We suggest that a shift in how LMH coexistence is studied is required. This would enable researchers to better understand the factors that affect coexistence among LMH species. In addition, it may be possible to use metabarcoding to efficiently obtain more detailed information about species-level diet partitioning among LMH species.

A recent study demonstrated that caspase-1, a protease that degrades α-syn, is increased in MSA. In addition, there is a strong association between α-syn and caspase-1 in MSA. We present here an in vivo proof of concept of the ability of the caspase-1 inhibitor prodrug VX-765 to mitigate α-syn pathology and to mediate neuroprotection in proteolipid protein (PLP)-synuclein mice, a transgenic model of MSA. In mice treated with the drug, the accumulation of α-syn was reduced, and the disease was attenuated.

It is regulated by iron-dependent peroxidation of phospholipids. Two key transcription factors involved in ferroptosis are sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and fatty acid synthase (FASN). We found that SREBP1 and fatty acid synthase are highly frequently mutated in human cancer. SREBP1 mediates the ferroptosis-suppressing activity of SREBP1 by producing monounsaturated fatty acids. This work reveals a potential strategy for cancer treatment. In conclusion, inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway combined with ferroptosis induction is a promising strategy for treating cancer.

In this study, we focus on neurons, which are the basic computational units of the brain. We show that amniote brains are substantially smaller relative to body size than brains in other endotherms. That is, they have low neuronal density. We also show that reptiles, birds, and primates, which are known for their cognitive abilities, have higher neuronal densities. This has important implications for studies using relative brain size to predict cognitive ability. We suggest that the low neuronal density in amniote brains leads to important evolutionary patterns. For example, reptiles, birds, and primates exhibit convergent scaling in brain neurons. This is an important finding for the study of brain evolution and the evolution of complex cognition.

Here, we demonstrate that the actin assembly machinery can be used for a slow but concerted action, as it is capable of severing actin filaments. The mechanism by which it does so is intriguing. It is based on the action of the protein actin depolymerizing factor/cofilin complex. We show that this machinery can be used to break the connections between filaments, thereby severing them. We believe that this mechanism is critical for the action of the actin assembly machinery in cells.

K+ channels commonly possess two pore gates, one at the intracellular end for fast channel activation/deactivation and the other at the selectivity filter for slow C-type inactivation/recovery. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks a classic intracellular bundle-crossing activation gate and normally shows no C-type inactivation. We observed prominent slow C-type inactivation in BK channels by an extreme low concentration of extracellular K+ together with a Y294E/K/Q/S or Y279F mutation whose equivalent in Shaker channels (T449E/K/D/Q/S or W434F) caused a greatly accelerated rate of C-type inactivation or constitutive C-inactivation. C-type inactivation in most K+ channels occurs upon sustained membrane depolarization or channel opening and then recovers during hyperpolarized membrane potentials or channel closure.

This invasion is essential for the parasite to establish the blood-stage infection. The invasion is facilitated by parasite-specific antigens, which bind to the red cell. The binding is crucial for parasite invasion, but its function is yet unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the binding of a parasite antigen to the red cell surface leads to the red cell displaying a lower membrane bending modulus and increased cytoskeletal tension. Using real-time deformability cytometry, we show that these changes in the red cell are significantly correlated with parasite invasion efficiency. This finding suggests that the malaria parasite primes the red cell surface through its antigens. This may lead to a reexamination of the mechanism of parasite invasion.
Simplified version: Malaria is a major health and economic burden in resource-limited countries. To date, experimental studies into malaria invasion have focused on the role of parasite adhesins or signaling pathways.

Previous work has suggested that a subset of the LH GABA neurons projects to the VTA and targets GABA neurons, inhibiting them and thereby disinhibiting dopaminergic activity and release. Stimulation-induced eating is attenuated by dopamine lesions or dopamine receptor antagonists. Here, we explored the involvement of dopamine in LH stimulation-induced eating. LH stimulation caused sated mice to pick up pellets of standard chow with latencies that varied based on stimulation intensity; once food was picked up, animals ate for the remainder of the 60-s stimulation period. However, lesion of VTA GABA neurons failed to disrupt this effect. Moreover, direct stimulation of VTA or substantia nigra dopamine cell bodies failed to induce food approach or eating. Looking further, we found that some LH GABA fibers pass through the VTA to more caudal sites, where they synapse onto neurons near the locus coeruleus. These findings establish the VTA as a critical downstream circuit element for LH neurons. Furthermore, we show that this circuit is not involved in the hunger or satiety mechanisms that govern normal feeding. Thus, we present a characterization of brain circuitry that may promote"

Simplified version: The Photosystem I (PS II) reaction center is a complex system of proteins that mediate the photochemical capture of solar energy and its conversion to chemical energy. It is composed of approximately 100 proteins, which are encoded by ~100 genes. PS I and PS II are the primary sites of photosynthesis in higher plants. The reaction center is unique among the Earth's metabolic activities because it is the only actively growing organelle. The photochemical reaction center is the site of oxygenic photosynthesis, the primary mechanism of energy capture by photosynthetic organisms. The reaction center is a complex system of proteins that mediate the photochemical capture of solar energy and its conversion to chemical energy. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the reaction center. We discuss the structure, function, evolution, and implications of the photochemical reaction center for oxygenic photosynthesis.

The squid hosts V. fischeri for a period of time, and the bacteria help the host light up the night by producing bioluminescence. In this study, we found that the squid provides chitin to the bacteria. This chitin is catabolized by the symbiont, and its metabolism is critical to the maintenance of the squid-bacteria partnership. We propose that other hosts may similarly regulate the activities of their symbionts through the strategic provision of specific nutrients. This process could be important to the evolution of microbial community-associated symbioses.
Simplified version: The commensal bacteria, Vibrio fischeri, are essential for the survival of the host, the squid, Euprymna scolopes.

It regulates the absorption of nutrients, mounts immune responses, and prevents systemic infections. In this study, we investigate the consequences of cancer on the microbiome. We find that intestinal tumorigenesis leads to a dysbiotic microbiome and activates a regenerative response. The dysbiotic microbiome triggers a feedback loop between the tumor and microbiome, leading to tumor growth. We establish a JNK-dependent feedback amplification loop between intestinal tumors and the microbiome. These findings identify a mechanism to control the activity level of JNK signaling to maintain epithelial barrier function and host–microbe homeostasis. Collectively, they highlight the importance of controlling the activity level of JNK signaling to maintain epithelial barrier function and host–microbe homeostasis.
Barrier function is essential to maintain homeostasis and prevent systemic infection. The intestine is the primary site where nutrients are absorbed. Moreover, the epithelium serves as the first line of defense against pathogens. The intestinal epithelium is composed of multiple layers of epithelial cells and immune cells.

Our high-resolution imaging of these structures suggests that the striosome–dendron bouquets are likely to be part of a system involved in dopamine-related function, which may be altered in human disorders of dopamine function. The striosome–dendron bouquets likely represent specialized integrative units within the dopamine-containing nigral system. Given evidence that striosomes receive input from cortical regions related to the control of mood and motivation, the striosome–dendron bouquets are likely critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease. Accordingly, a better understanding of the striosome–dendron bouquets may lead to a better understanding of the function of human disorders of dopamine.

However, the increased capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weight, increasing risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses were nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated deeper soil layers and now exceed safe mechanical limits. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery, such as those designed by the prehistoric giants, who were free to roam as they pleased. Our hypothesis is that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants.
