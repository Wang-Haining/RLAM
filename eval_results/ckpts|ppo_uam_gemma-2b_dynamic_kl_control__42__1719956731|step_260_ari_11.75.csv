We studied the structure of the encapsulated Ne hydrates. The guest Ne atoms occupy the center of channels and have substantial freedom of movement. The density distribution of the encapsulated Ne atoms along the channels is further constrained by interactions between adjacent Ne atoms. The chemical reactivity of Ne atoms suggests that their encapsulation in water may be a valuable approach for drug delivery.
The reported structure is very stable, with a stability threshold of 480 MPa.

This provides a compelling argument for the establishment of the species in Europe as early as the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC).

In addition, we show that RppH supports the hypothesis that the function of RppH is to ensure rapid degradation of Np4-capped RNA in response to stress. Consequently, we propose a model in which the function of RppH is to distinguish between capped and uncapped 5′ termini.

Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, in the days (Studies 1 and 2) and months (Studies 3 through 6) following the 2016 American presidential election, women’s and men’s endorsement of HM predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. In addition, as conceptualized, HM was associated with less trust in the government (Study 3), more sexism (Study 4), more racism (Study 5), and more xenophobia (Study 6) but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors.

Both MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes mediate pseudovirus entry into human cells, whereas only MERS-CoV spike mediates pseudovirus entry into bat cells. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4.

Climate warming is hypothesized to increase rates of soil respiration. However, despite considerable scientific attention, the effect of climate warming on soil respiration remains unclear. We synthesized a unique global dataset of soil respiration and climate warming experiments, totaling 3,800 observations representing 27 experimental climate warming manipulation studies spanning nine biomes. Our results demonstrate that there is no statistically significant difference in soil respiration between control and warmed plots in all biomes, with the exception of deserts and boreal forests. Our findings provide limited evidence of acclimation of soil respiration to experimental warming in several major biome types. Thus, this study provides limited evidence of regional variability in soil respiration responses to climate change. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that soil respiration rates increase with soil temperature up to a threshold of 25 °C, above which respiration rates decrease with further increases in temperature. This consistent decrease in soil respiration sensitivity to temperature at higher temperatures demonstrates that rising global temperatures may result in regionally variable responses in soil carbon dynamics.

Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. As an alternative approach to identify the convergence of the targets and functions of the autism-risk genes, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk genes. We discovered that all five autism-risk genes led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes. Our findings offer a critical insight into the complex etiology of ASD.”

This fossil material has been poorly understood and misinterpreted in the past. Now, based upon the study of more than 1,000 carefully prepared specimens, a detailed analysis of Montsechia is presented. The morphology and anatomy of the plant suggest that Montsechia is sister to Ceratophyllum, with which it shares many characteristics. Montsechia is Barremian in age, raising questions about the very early divergence of the Ceratophyllum clade compared with its position as sister to eudicots in many cladistic analyses.

Finally, we show that the symbiotic crypts are critical for the squid to survive.

The present study systematically investigated the mechanisms governing the regioisomeric DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis. Intriguingly, we discovered distinct pathways for the three regioisomeric DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis. Protein-mediated RNA primer synthesis is a crucial mechanism for bypass transcriptional lesions. In addition, the results of in vitro studies are well correlated with in vivo mutagenesis assay. Finally, we identified a minor-groove–sensing motif from pol II, which modulates transcriptional lesion-specific transcriptional bypass. This work provides important mechanistic insights into transcriptional stalling, transcriptional lesion bypass, and mutagenesis of alkylated DNA lesions.2019-2020-2021-2022-20232019-2020-2021-2022-20232019-2020-2021-2022-2023

Mutation of the first cleavage site expands virus tropism to lung-derived human cell cultures. Consistent with this finding, uncleaved S proteins resist receptor-induced conformational changes, which inhibit virus targeting to endosomes.

The effects of CRFR1 signaling on cerebral edema are blocked by the CRFR1 antagonist. In addition, we show that the CRFR1-induced signaling of cAMP/PKA contributes to the up-regulation of aquaporin-4 in astrocytes. Finally, using transfected CHO cells, we show that CRFR1-driven signaling of cAMP/PKA can trigger cerebral edema via the up-regulation of aquaporin-4.

Consequently, ETVECs exhibit endothelial functional features and form mature functional vasculature in Matrigel plugs transplanted in NOD/SCID mice.

A better understanding of processes involved in coral–algal symbiosis breakdown will help us address the current threats to coral reefs.
Simplified version: Recurrent mass bleaching events are pushing coral reefs worldwide to the brink of ecological collapse. While the symptoms and consequences of this breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis are well characterized, our understanding of the underlying causes remains incomplete. Here, we investigated the nutrient fluxes and the physiological and molecular responses of the widespread coral Stylophora pistillata to heat stress prior to the onset of bleaching to identify processes involved in the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis. We show that altered nutrient cycling during heat stress is a primary driver of the functional breakdown of the symbiosis. Heat stress increased the metabolic energy demand of the coral host, which was compensated by the catabolic degradation of amino acids. The resulting shift from net uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont subsequently promoted the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a"

We demonstrate that striatonigral fibers originating in striosomes form highly unusual bouquet-like arborizations that target bundles of ventrally oriented dopamine-containing dendrites and clusters of their parent nigral cell bodies. Retrograde tracing showed that these clustered cell bodies in turn project to the striatum as part of the classic nigrostriatal pathway. Thus, these striosome–dendron bouquets likely represent subsystems with the nigro–striato–nigral loop that are affected in human disorders including Parkinson’s disease. Within these bouquets, expansion microscopy resolved many individual striosome fibers tightly intertwined with dopamine-containing dendrites and also with afferents labeled by glutamatergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic markers and markers for astrocytic cells and fibers, and connexin 43 puncta. We suggest that striosome–dendron bouquets form specialized integrative units within the dopamine-containing nigral system. Given evidence that striosomes receive input from cortical regions related to mood and motivation and that they link functionally to reinforcement and decision-making, the striosome–dendron bouquets could be critical to dopamine-related function in health and disease."

Simplified version: Silicon can enhance the resistance of plants against insect herbivores. However, how silicon modifies the activity of the jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that silicon can enhance the resistance of plants against the rice leaffolder, a major herbivore of rice. Silicon pretreatment triggered the accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA) in leaves and promoted the accumulation of silicon in leaves. This, in turn, enhanced the resistance of plants against the rice leaffolder. This process was regulated by the jasmonic acid signaling pathway. Additionally, the expression of jasmonic acid-related genes was enhanced in leaves of silicon-treated plants. This indicates that silicon can enhance the defense of plants against insects by regulating the jasmonic acid signaling pathway.

We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on estimates of mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of chronic subsoil compaction risk over 20% of arable land, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters approaches that of the largest animals that walked Earth, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity as modern farm vehicles. We suggest that ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, must have guided these prehistoric giants.
