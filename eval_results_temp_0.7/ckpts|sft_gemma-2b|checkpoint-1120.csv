To understand the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite, we analyzed genetic data from two distantly related myxozoan species, Kudoa iwatai and Myxobolus cerebralis, and compared these to the transcriptome and genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite Polypodium hydriforme. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content.
Simplified summary: The Myxozoa are a group of microscopic, obligate, parasitic animals. Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians."

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1 channels, but become active once introduced into the low-Zn2+-concentration environment of the female reproductive tract. How Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. Here, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and"

Earlier studies suggest that once the optimum growing temperature is exceeded, mean crop yields decline and the variability of yield increases even if interannual climate variability remains unchanged. Here, we use global datasets of maize production and climate variability combined with future temperature projections to quantify how yield variability will change in the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. We find that as the global mean temperature increases, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation (CV) of maize yields increases almost everywhere to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the SD of yields and a decrease in mean yields. For the top four maize-exporting countries, which account for 87% of global maize exports, the probability that they have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °"

These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers, and grass consumption was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of % grass consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.

Second, the risk of closure was negatively associated with the expected length of the crisis. Moreover, businesses had widely varying beliefs about the likely duration of COVID-related disruptions. Third, many small businesses are financially fragile: The median business with more than \$10,000 in monthly expenses had only about 2 wk of cash on hand at the time of the survey. Fourth, the majority of businesses planned to seek funding through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.

Our observations of the size distribution of floating plastic debris indicate that nano-fragmentation of the plastics removes millimeter-sized fragments.

However, the use of a single material phase and heuristically developed structural patterns leads to restricted design space and potential failure to achieve specific target behaviors. Here, we propose a free-form inverse design approach that enables the discovery of composite structures with distinct materials seamlessly collaborating to produce target behaviors. The digitally synthesized structures exhibit organic shapes and motions with irregular distributions of material phases. Within the structures, different materials play distinct roles and seamlessly collaborate through sophisticated deformation mechanisms to produce the target behaviors. While complex in geometry and material heterogeneity, the discovered structures are effectively manufactured via multimaterial fabrication with different polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomers with distinct behaviors and their highly nonlinear responses are physically and accurately realized in experiments. To enhance programmability, the synthesized structures are heteroassembled into architectures that exhibit highly complex yet navigable responses. The proposed synthesis, multimaterial fabrication, and heteroassembly strategy can be utilized to design function-oriented and situation-specific mechanical devices for a wide range of applications.

This policy has shaped landscape-level forest restoration in the West, but its effect on biodiversity is unknown. We used 25 years of regional bird surveys, forest data, and land-ownership maps to test this policy’s effect on biodiversity. Clearcutting decreased rapidly, and we expected populations of older-forest–associated birds to stabilize on federal land, but to continue declining on private industrial lands. In contrast, we expected declines in early-seral–associated species on federal land because of reduced anthropogenic disturbance since the NWFP. Bayesian hierarchical models revealed that bird species’ population trends tracked changes in forest composition. However, against our expectations, declines of birds associated with older forests accelerated. These declines are partly explained by losses of older forests due to fire on federal land and continued clearcutting elsewhere. Overall, the early-seral ecosystem area was stable, but declined in two ecoregions—the Coast Range and Cascades—along with early-seral bird populations.

We address this paradox by demonstrating that it is possible to prove that deep learning can be described using mathematical properties that guarantee the existence of stable neural networks with great approximation qualities; however, there does not exist any algorithm, even randomized, that can train (or compute) such a network. For any positive integers K and L, there are cases where simultaneously 1) no randomized training algorithm can compute a neural network correct to K digits with probability greater than 1/2; 2) there exists a deterministic training algorithm that computes a network with K –1 correct digits, but any such (even randomized) algorithm needs arbitrarily many training data; and 3) there exists a deterministic training algorithm that computes a network with K –2 correct digits using no more than L training samples. These results imply a classification theory describing conditions under which (stable) neural networks with a given accuracy can be computed by an algorithm.

Therefore, it is crucial to know which factors facilitated this innovation. The most frequently used proxy for cognitive ability is relative brain size, which provides an insight into the brain structures of animals without looking at the evolution of their cognitive abilities. To get a less biased picture of the evolutionary paths leading to cognitive superpowers, we need to analyze brain evolution by the numbers of neurons in animals. This study compares the numbers of neurons in the largest dataset of its kind by using the numbers of neurons to reconstruct the evolution of brain size across amniotes. We show that relative brain size is not just a proxy but that the number of neurons in reptiles, birds, and primates is associated with relative brain size. This has important implications for studies using relative brain size as a proxy when looking for evolutionary drivers of animal cognition.

We find a common Bantu and Austronesian descent for all Malagasy individuals with a limited paternal contribution from Europe and the Middle East. Admixture and demographic growth happened recently, suggesting a rapid settlement of Madagascar during the last millennium. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, there are geographic influences on the present genomic diversity, independent of the admixture, showing that a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations.

Gain-of-function mutations in A1 and GPIbα in VWD suggest conformational regulation. We report that force application switches A1 and/or GPIbα to a second state with faster on-rate, providing a mechanism for activating VWF binding to platelets.

Second, it exploits the current global climate, using aerosol transmission to infect more people. Third, it exploits perception, adopting methods that allow it to evade detection methods.

Whether and how the brain builds such structures, however, remains largely unknown. Here, we used human intracranial recordings to investigate how left-hemispheric brain activity varies during the formation of phrase structures. In a broad set of language-related areas, comprising multiple superior temporal and inferior frontal sites, high-gamma power increased with each successive word in a sentence but decreased suddenly whenever words could be merged into a phrase. Regression analyses showed that each additional word or multiword phrase contributed a similar amount of additional brain activity, providing evidence for a merge operation that applies equally to linguistic objects of arbitrary complexity. More superficial models of language, based solely on sequential transition probability over lexical and syntactic categories, only captured activity in the posterior middle temporal gyrus. Formal model comparison indicated that the model of multiword phrase construction provided a better fit than probability-based models at most sites in superior temporal and inferior frontal cortices. Activity in those regions was consistent with a neural implementation of a bottom-up or left-corner parser of the incoming language stream. Our results provide initial intracranial evidence for"

The arachnid spider can increase its sound-sensitive surface area enormously to detect and locate the source of airborne acoustic waves. By outsourcing its acoustic sensors to its web, the spider is released from body size constraints and permits the araneid spider to increase its sound-sensitive surface area up to 10,000 times greater than the spider itself. We also demonstrate that the spider is capable of functionally adjusting and regularly regenerating its external ""eardrum"" according to its needs.

This paper presents a simple and objective method to identify the animal origin of parchment. The noninvasive method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles that originated in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals; however, we did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides. These results suggest that ultrafine vellum does not necessarily derive from the use of abortive or newborn animals with ultrathin hides, but could equally well reflect a production process that allowed the skins of maturing animals of several species to be rendered into vellum of equal quality and fineness.

Mulliken electronegativity, which is the negative of the chemical potential of the electron in a given atom relative to the vacuum, is appropriately modified; instead of taking the vacuum (impossible under high pressure), we take the homogeneous electron gas as reference. We find that for most elements, chemical hardness and electronegativity decrease with pressure, consistent with pressure-induced metallization.

The squid and its symbiont both use chitin, a polymeric carbon source, and they both use a diurnal cycle of light provision. This study provides a direct link between chitin utilization and symbiont persistence. Finally, chitin catabolism by the symbionts was also specifically required for a periodic acidification of the adult crypts, increasing the level of oxygen available to the symbionts, enhancing their capacity to produce bioluminescence at night.

The NVDRS summarizes violent death incidents with structured variables and unstructured narratives. We identify 225 latent topics in the narratives (e.g., preparation for death and physical aggression); many of these topics are not captured by existing structured variables. Motivated by known patterns in suicide and homicide by gender and recent research on gender biases in semantic space, we identify the gender bias of our topics (e.g., a topic about pain medication is feminine). We then compare the gender bias of topics to their prevalence in narratives of female versus male victims.

Despite considerable scientific attention in recent decades, the overall response of soil respiration to anticipated climatic warming remains unclear. Our analysis reveals no significant differences in the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration between control and warmed plots in all biomes, with the exception of deserts and boreal forests. Thus, our data provide limited evidence of acclimation of soil respiration to experimental warming in several major biome types, contrary to the results from multiple single-site studies. Moreover, across all nondesert biomes, respiration rates with and without experimental warming follow a Gaussian response, increasing with soil temperature up to a threshold of ∼25 °C, above which respiration rates decrease with further increases in temperature. This consistent decrease in temperature sensitivity at higher temperatures demonstrates that rising global temperatures may result in regionally variable responses in soil respiration, with colder climates being considerably more responsive to increased ambient temperatures compared with warmer regions. Our analysis adds a unique cross-biome perspective on the temperature response of soil respiration, information critical to improving our mechanistic understanding of how soil carbon dynamics change with climatic warming.

Chromate-type oxygen-sensitive proteins (O2-sensitive [4Fe-4S] cluster proteins), which are used by many anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria, are composed of two proteins. One protein, the catalytic subunit of the O2-dependent enzyme, is highly conserved among cyanobacteria and photosynthesizing bacteria, whereas the other protein, which we term the O2-dependent enzyme, is not. In contrast to the O2-dependent enzymes of higher plants, cyanobacteria, and certain phototrophic bacteria, the O2-dependent enzyme of the purple betaproteobacterium Rubrivivax gelatinosus requires an additional subunit, and we term this protein the O2-dependent enzyme. The O2-dependent enzymes of the cyanobacteria and photosynthesizing bacteria have extended evolutionarily, and we discuss the perspectives of the O2-dependent enzymes of higher plants, cyanobacteria, and photosynthesizing bacteria. This review includes a discussion of the catalytic mechanism of the O2-dependent enzymes of higher plants, cyanobacteria, and photosynthesizing bacteria.

Here we use a polyglutamine-expanded form of human huntingtin with a fluorescent tag to monitor the spreading of aggregates in the Drosophila brain in a model of Huntington’s disease. Upon expression of this construct in a defined subset of neurons, we demonstrate that protein aggregates accumulate at synaptic terminals and progressively spread throughout the brain. These aggregates are internalized and accumulate within other neurons. We show that Htt aggregates cause non-cell-autonomous pathology, including loss of vulnerable neurons that can be prevented by inhibiting endocytosis in these neurons. Finally, we show that the release of aggregates requires N-ethylmalemide-sensitive fusion protein 1, demonstrating that active release and uptake of Htt aggregates are important elements of spreading and disease progression.

Surprisingly, we found that the squid supplied chitin to the bacteria only at night, when the light-producing activity of the bacteria was high. This suggestion that the squid provides chitin to its symbionts only at night provides a direct link between chitin utilization and symbiont persistence. The squid achieves this through a specific temporal rhythm of hemocytes, which migrate into the symbiotic organ. The subsequent catabolism of chitin induces an increase in the level of oxygen available to the symbionts, allowing them to produce bioluminescence at night.

In 2004, NIH funded a study of how stress and chronic stress affect the brain. In 2013, NIH funded a study of how stress and chronic stress affect the brain. Therefore, I propose that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) fund a longitudinal study of the relationship between stress and the brain.

However, the molecular mechanisms of DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional stalling and mutagenesis remain unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated how RNA polymerase II (pol II) recognizes and bypasses regioisomeric O2-, N3-, and O4-ethylthymidine (O2-, N3-, and O4-EtdT) lesions. We observed distinct pol II stalling profiles for the three regioisomeric EtdT lesions. Intriguingly, pol II stalling at O2-EtdT and N3-EtdT sites is exacerbated by TFIIS-stimulated proofreading activity. Assessment for the impact of the EtdT lesions on individual fidelity checkpoints provided further mechanistic insights, where the transcriptional lesion bypass routes for the three EtdT lesions are controlled by distinct fidelity checkpoints. The error-free transcriptional lesion bypass route is strongly favored for the minor-groove O2-EtdT lesion. In contrast, a dominant error-prone route stemming from GMP misincorporation was observed for the major-groove O4-EtdT lesion"

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus–cell membrane fusion. Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas the more rigid uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into"

Here, we demonstrate that ets variant 2 (ETV2) alone directly converts primary human adult skin fibroblasts into functional vascular endothelial cells. In coordination with endogenous FOXC2, transduced ETV2 elicits expression of multiple key endothelial development factors, including FLI1, ERG, and TAL1, and induces expression of endothelial functional molecules, including EGFL7 and von Willebrand factor. Consequently, ETVECs exhibits EC characteristics in vitro and forms mature functional vasculature in Matrigel plugs transplanted in NOD SCID mice.

Both neuron outgrowth types are triggered by physical lesion of the sensory dendrite or mutations disrupting sensory activity, calcium signaling, or genes that restrict outgrowth during neuronal maturation, such as SAX-1/NDR kinase or UNC-43/CaMKII. These connections suggest that ectopic outgrowth represents a powerful platform for gene discovery in neuronal regeneration. Moreover, we note numerous similarities between C. elegans DLK-independent regeneration and lesion conditioning, a phenomenon producing robust regeneration in the mammalian CNS.

Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1 and that this is established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies.

We also investigated whether gut dysfunction is associated with the psychological symptoms of alcohol dependence. Finally, we tested the reversibility of the biological and behavioral parameters after a short-term detoxification program. We found that some, but not all, alcohol-dependent subjects developed gut leakiness, which was associated with higher scores of depression, anxiety, and alcohol craving after 3 wk of abstinence, which may be important psychological factors of relapse. Moreover, subjects with increased gut permeability also had altered composition and activity of the gut microbiota.

An examination of the sequence and expression analysis demonstrated that FT does not function in activating flowering in dodder. We show that FT-induced flowering of the host is likely required for both host and parasite flowering. The study illustrates how regressive evolution, commonly found in parasites, may facilitate the synchronization of parasite and host, here allowing the C. australis parasite to time reproduction exactly with that of their host.

Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. The temporal scale of these effects (&lt;250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners.

These cells integrate voltage-gated currents from channels on the membrane surface (membrane clock) with rhythmic Ca2+ release from internal Ca2+ stores (Ca2+ clock) to adjust heart rate to meet hemodynamic demand. Here, we report that stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and Orai1 channels, key components of store-operated Ca2+ entry, are selectively expressed in SANCs. Cardiac-specific deletion of STIM1 in mice resulted in depletion of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ stores of SANCs and led to SAN dysfunction, as was evident by a reduction in heart rate, sinus arrest, and an exaggerated autonomic response to cholinergic signaling. STIM1 influenced SAN function by regulating ionic fluxes in SANCs, including activation of a store-operated Ca2+ current, a reduction in L-type Ca2+ current, and enhancing the activities of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. These studies reveal that STIM1 is a multifunctional regulator of Ca2+ dynamics in SANCs that links SR Ca2+ store content with electrical"
