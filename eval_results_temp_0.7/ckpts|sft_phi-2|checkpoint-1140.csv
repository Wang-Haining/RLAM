The key is that the excitation of the transition state of the redox reaction (a) in the presence of a singlet oxygen radical (∼ΔH=−45.5 eV) is compensated by the formation of a triplet oxygen radical (∼ΔH=−14.1 eV) in the presence of a triplet excited state of the metal complex. The photo-induced structural changes are accompanied by a decrease in the surface tension, which is ∼1.5 times lower than the equilibrium value of the free radical.

This is not a conventional ontology of math, but a continuum in which the only option is to let it live or die. Some of us have a conviction that the theory is more or less right, and that the math is mostly right, but not really. The right (but not the whole) is almost certainly not the same as the whole. And the whole is not necessarily the same as the right. The question is whether or not we are in a position to change the math to make it compatible with the physics, biology, and economics of the natural world.
The simple version is that it is not the math that matters, but the right or wrongness of the theory. Or, as physicist Carlo Rovelli has put it, “the math is not the science, but rather the way we describe the science.” The corollary is that it is not the math, but the rightness of the math, that makes the difference between success and failure.

This pandemic has taught us a lot about the origin and behavior of this particular coronavirus, and it has also shown us that viral antagonism is a key to the replication and proliferation of the virus. We must now consider this phenomenon as a valuable weapon against the pandemic. To be able to prepare a response to this phenomenon is therefore essential.

We propose that the evolutionary origin of the eukaryotic cell may have been a transition from a hydrogen-dependent prokaryotic eukaryote to a “proton-dependent eukaryote” (protometabolism). We hypothesize that the emergence of this proton-dependent eukaryotic metabolism was possible due to a shift in the position of the proton sensor of the voltage-gated proton channel Hv1 to the cytosol. We analyze the mechanism of proton sensing and conduction by Hv1 to show that the proton sensor is located within the innermost domain of the pore. This provides a new hypothesis for the origin of eukaryotic metabolism.

Our results reveal a striking level of dietary overlap within and between assemblages, as well as strong correlations between assemblage-level diversity and plant diversity.

In the US, the median business with more than $10,000 in monthly expenses had only 2 wk of cash on hand at the time of our survey. However, the CARES Act provides loans rather than grants to small businesses, and we find that small business owners are hesitant to apply for funds.

In the rest of the world, the plastic waste is largely removed from the environment. However, the plastic waste in the ocean, especially the plastic waste on the oceanic gyre, is not disappearing. This study demonstrates that the plastic waste is being continuously recycled and concentrated in the form of small plastic particles in the ocean. These findings indicate that the oceanic plastic pollution is a much bigger problem than previously thought and also indicates that the cumulative impact of this pollution on the entire oceanic ecosystem should be investigated.

We argue that the reason is that they have more energy to devote to reproduction.
Theoretically, if you can get away with it, the “reproductive power” of a species should be very sensitive to the environmental conditions of the habitat and to the availability of resources. In fact, an important limiting factor for reproduction is the maternal metabolic rate. Mothers in environments with limited resources are expected to be more energetic-efficient and to have higher reproductive success. We compare the reproductive output of placental mammal mothers in the USA, the UK, and China and find that maternal energy expenditure is the most important factor explaining variance in reproductive output. We identify that maternal metabolic rate is roughly 20% higher in the UK and 10% higher in China than in the USA. The most important factor explaining these differences is the availability of allomaternal care. In the UK, where the cost of allomaternal care is lower, the reproductive power of mothers is much higher. This result is robust to the inclusion of habitat, household income, and other variables, and is independent of"

The quote “I don’t believe this is what we’re here to do” is on the lips of many science and engineering students and postdocs. We are enamored of building and making and sometimes forget the essential biological tasks that are so crucial to the functioning of the body. We are so enamored that we often fail to recognize the complexity and the hard work of the body’s own “amateur” engineers, the endothelial cells. The endothelium is the single-cell organ of the circulatory system, and its cells form a barrier between blood and the tissues of the body. The endothelium’s unique structure, function, and activity are essential to the body’s ability to adapt to changes in the environment and to repair itself. A critical question that has not been well understood is how this single-cell organ processes the massive amount of information needed to detect and respond to its constantly changing environment. We have developed a method for single-cell Ca2+ imaging and analysis to measure the spatial and temporal activity of thousands of endothelial cells simultaneously. The highly"

The social context of the mind is a major determinant of human behavior, yet the underlying neural mechanisms of its modulation remain elusive. The neural substrate of social dominance and anxiety is thought to be represented in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), the reward center of the striatum. However, the direct causal relationship between the NAc and social behavior is unknown. We identified the main determinant of social dominance and anxiety in male outbred rats as low-anxious individuals, who establish a subordinate status in a social encounter with a high-anxious individual. We found that anxiety-prone animals exhibited reduced mitochondrial function in the NAc, and in particular of the more vulnerable mitochondrial complex I. Moreover, an anxiolytic drug ameliorated the subordinate status of high-anxious rats, whereas a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor exacerbated the subordinate status of high-anxious animals. We conclude that the brain’s energy metabolism is a key factor in the modulation of social behavior, and suggest that mitochondrial function in the NAc is a promising biomarker and potential target"

A while ago, I attended a talk by a neuroscientist who did some work on the role of the hippocampus in episodic memory. He suggested that episodic memory is a function of the hippocampus, and that this might be the origin of the word “episodic”. Episodic memory is memory of episodes in one’s life, which are the basis of autobiographical memory. Episodic memory is arguably one of the most important aspects of the human mind, and arguably, one of the most interesting.
I was fascinated by the idea that episodic memory is the origin of the word episodic.

However, in a small proportion of humans, the fetal to adult hemoglobin ratio is disrupted. We have identified a putative mechanism by which the IGF2BP1 transcription factor can repress the induction of adult hemoglobin in erythroid cells by repressing the expression of BCL11A.
The mechanism of the fetal to adult hemoglobin reprogramming was tested in the reprogramming of erythroid cells to fibroblasts. The expression of BCL11A was repressed by IGF2BP1, and the adult to fetal hemoglobin reprogramming was blocked in the absence of IGF2BP1. The reprogramming was also blocked by IGF2BP1 in human erythroid cells in vitro. The age-dependent changes in hemoglobin expression were confirmed in an erythroid cell model. These results suggest a mechanism for the fetal to adult hemoglobin reprogramming.

The Tumor Microenvironment, Tumor Heterogeneity, and Resistance to Cancer Therapy: An Evolving Conceptual Framework
Tumor heterogeneity is a well-established hallmark of malignant cancer, but its functional significance is still unclear. In particular, the role of tumor heterogeneity in the development of resistance to cancer therapy remains elusive. Here, we address this issue by integrating the concepts of cancer heterogeneity and tumor microenvironment, which are considered to be closely linked. We provide a comprehensive review of the potential roles of tumor heterogeneity in the development of resistance to cancer therapy, with a focus on the tumor microenvironment. The proposed models of tumor heterogeneity-driven therapy resistance are (i) a preexisting"

One class, the calcium channel blockers (CCBs), has been developed from the “naturally occurring” catecholamine analog verapamil. Another, the angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), has been developed from the “naturally occurring” plant alkaloid losartan. The discovery of these drugs has opened up new avenues for drug discovery and development.

Our understanding of the impact of the lake level drop on Lake Malawi’s endemic cichlid fishes is particularly revealing, as the extinctions and speciation events that occurred in the lake are unprecedented in the fossil record. By analyzing lake level fluctuations and lake–cichlid population dynamics, we are able to reconstruct the combined impact of past climate change and human impact on this system, and to assess the resilience of a tropical lake to rapid and large-scale environmental change. The presentation will discuss the implications of this study for our understanding of the dynamics of tropical lakes and their fish communities, which are expected to be especially vulnerable to anthropogenic climate change.

This scenario is consistent with the hypothesis of a global impact event at the YBP, which may have been responsible for the most recent global glaciation.

While CTLA-4 deficiency produced an extreme phenotype of autoimmunity, deletion of CTLA-4 in adult mice did not kill the animals. Rather, it induced autoimmune diseases with more or less severe symptoms. This discrepancy may be due to the fact that CTLA-4 deficiency affects the balance between proinflammatory Th1- and Th2-like cells. Thus, deletion of CTLA-4 in adult mice might be beneficial in the presence of a chronic infection or cancer and is therefore not as harmful as in congenital CTLA-4 deficiency.
In a similar fashion to the liver, where the CTLA-4 family is expressed in various cells and subcellular compartments, we have identified a subset of thymocytes that express CTLA-4 predominantly on the surface.

This is largely due to the ability of animals to occupy most ecological niches on land and in the oceans. The origin of animals is also marked by a series of adaptive radiations of herbivorous animals, including insects, which ultimately led to the evolution of the largest and most diverse group of animals on Earth, the beetles. However, the diversification of animals has been a highly debated topic, with different hypotheses on the factors that drove animal diversification and the timing of major events in animal evolution. Here, we explore the evolution of herbivorous beetles by integrating data from genome sequencing and analysis of ancient fossils. We find that the origin of the herbivorous insects coincides with the earliest appearances of angiosperms and horizontal gene transfer events in beetles, which in turn led to the evolution of specialized plant-feeding strategies. Our study supports the hypothesis that the diversification of animals was driven by multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles.

Dear Students,

We hope this email finds you well. We wanted to bring to your attention a pressing matter that requires your immediate attention. As you may have heard, the world is currently facing a global pandemic caused by the emergence of new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These variants, such as the Delta variant, have the potential to cause significant harm and disrupt our lives. It is crucial for us to understand the magnitude of this threat and take necessary precautions to safeguard ourselves and our loved ones.

The extent to which these processes rely on social learning, rather than biological evolution, is still a matter of debate. Here we use a large-scale social learning experiment, in which 543 people attempted to build a paper plane, to test whether social learning can be a significant contributor to artifactive evolution. We find that large populations of learners produce more adaptive artifacts, but only up to a point. After a certain point, they produce poorer artifacts. This relationship is driven by the fact that larger populations provide more variation for trial-and-error learning, but also overwhelm working memory, leading to a loss of selective copying of the best-adapted designs. Our results suggest that there is no single mechanism that drives the evolution of artifacts: rather, successful evolution depends on a complex interplay between biological evolution, social learning, and trial-and-error learning.
The (dis)appearance of the social-learning effect on artifactive evolution, and the reemergence of biological evolution after a sufficiently long period, have been suggested in various contexts, such as the invention of"

Scientists have been trying to make the Earth’s inner core for many years, but the results were always disappointing. The difference between the Earth and the laboratory was that the Earth had an additional element – the planet’s magnetic field. The Earth’s magnetic field is responsible for protecting us from the solar wind, a constant stream of particles emitted by the sun, and it is a magnetic field that has a strong influence on the nucleation of the inner core. To make the Earth’s inner core, it is therefore important to mimic this magnetic field.

One of the most important technical challenges of the 21st century is to produce machines that can think and act like humans. Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, has been at the forefront of the effort to create such machines. This talk will attempt to put this effort in perspective by discussing the history of machine learning as a field, where it is now, and where it is going.
Statisticians have been working on machine learning problems for almost as long as the field of statistics itself. However, machine learning was not the first application of statistics to the problems of artificial intelligence. In the early 1950s, the field of artificial intelligence was arguably at its peak, and the same statistical tools that we now associate with machine learning were being applied to a range of problems, including speech recognition, robotics, and expert systems. These efforts were driven by the realization that statistics was the only way to make any progress in artificial intelligence. In the middle of the decade, however, the field of artificial intelligence abruptly entered a long period of stagnation, in which progress was so slow that it was often referred to as"

A similar effect can be observed in the way the world is being researched and represented, with many researchers uncritically elevating their own version of the world as the only version that matters.
But the idea that we are all experiencing a pandemic is also just as wrong, for the same reason as it is true of the coronavirus itself: It is a symptom, not the disease. It’s a belief system, not the evidence, that drives the “what’s happening” narrative. It is a matter of interpretation, not fact. It’s no wonder that the majority of people who believe the pandemic narrative are the same people who believe in conspiracy theories, or are unable to think critically.
In short, the belief in a virus has nothing to do with reality, and everything to do with ideology. We are living in an age of the Big Lie, and we need to learn to recognize it.

T. brucei is one of the oldest known pathogens, having evolved more than 3.5 billion years ago. Nevertheless, the molecular phylogeny of T. brucei is still a matter of debate, and no consensus has been reached. In this talk, we will present the genetic analysis of the closest living relatives of T. brucei, including the amoeba (Acanthamoeba), the flagellate (Mycetophagia), and the yeast (Schizosaccharomyces). By comparing the genomes of these three organisms, we will reconstruct the phylogeny of the Mycetozoa, to which T. brucei belongs, and we will discuss the origins of African trypanosomiasis and the possible routes of its spread into Africa.

A simple model has recently been developed to understand the fundamental physics of the far field, by a machine-learning approach based on an ensemble of canonical quantized states. The nonlinear wavefunctions are expected to exhibit the wave-particle duality of the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED), which is a fundamental part of the Standard Model. The machine-learning approach has been used to discover the missing part of the EPR paradox, which is the hidden variable theory, by the way of which the wave-particle duality can be explained. Recently, the discovery of the entanglement-based Wigner function has established the link between the physics of entanglement and the wave-particle duality. It was shown that the spin-spin entanglement is the key to the evolution of the wave-particle duality. In the present work, we propose a unified theory of quantum magnetism based on the wave-particle duality and the entanglement. We demonstrate the universality of the theory by the calculation of the spin-spin entanglement entropy, the Majorana character, and the spectral gap of the spin-orbit"

To understand the mechanism of the plague, we developed a quantitative model of plague transmission via human ectoparasite vectors, which can provide a simple but highly informative interpretation of the epidemiological characteristics of the pandemic, including the contact rate, the mean incubation period, and the rate of recoveries.

The rates of increase were the most dramatic in birds and primates. The mechanisms responsible for this and the evolution of human-specific cognitive ability have not been fully explained, but we speculate that the rise of the neocortex in hominins, which is responsible for most of our cognitive abilities, has been the key driver.

This is partly because pancreatic cancer cells are not only remarkably adept at evading death, but also for having a remarkable capacity to change metabolic phenotype. Here we report that inhibition of mitochondrial respiration with a TRAP1-deficient adenocarcinoma cell line promoted cancer cell death by inducing a switch from aerobic glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation. We further showed that the metabolic switch was both mechanistically and functionally associated with the expression of proapoptotic Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), with the capacity to induce apoptosis in TRAP1-deficient cells. Our data reveal a previously unrecognized role for TRAP1 in mitochondrial respiration and apoptosis, in a hitherto unexplored context, and raise the possibility that metabolic reprogramming of cancers may be exploited as an effective therapeutic target.

This torque enhances the severing rate constant by a factor of >100. Thus, the location of ADF/cofilin binding in the filament strongly influences the fate of the filament.

The only difference between these two modes of cultural evolution is that the former is relatively easy to follow, and the latter is more subtle, but more widespread. This is because, in contrast to culture, genetic diversity is easy to measure, whereas cultural diversity is not. Because of this, the former has been the main focus of genetic studies, and has been the main focus of the Anthropocene in the age of the Anthropocence.
However, the Anthropocene is now at an impasse, as the rate of cultural evolution is more or less linear, and the size of human cultural and technological change is much smaller than the rate of cultural evolution.

The sequence of these components, which are often highly conserved, is largely fixed by evolution and, hence, difficult to change. However, within each family, there are often evolutionary “tweaks” that, by necessity, cannot be detected by sequence analysis alone. This paper describes the first direct measurement of the sequence evolution of a large family of proteins, namely the tRNA pseudouridine (Ψ) modification, and compares this to the direct sequence evolution of the corresponding protein catalytic domain. We find that the Ψ pseudouridine modification is the least conserved and most variable of all the sequence changes in the family. This is consistent with previous studies of other tRNA pseudouridine modifications. We also find that the Ψ modification, while evolutionarily stable, is subject to “leapfrogging” by mutations, which are more likely to occur in regions of high sequence similarity. This can result in rapid evolution of a protein family, which is a unique feature of pseudouridine modifications. This finding may have important consequences for the evolution of tRNA pseudouridine modifications, and possibly"

We find that all three extant lineages have been evolving toward a common body size attractor of ∼500 kg. This pattern is not simply a reflection of common ancestry, as it is seen in a wide range of extant and extinct species. The existence of this body size attractor, and the relatively rapid selection toward, and limited deviation from, this attractor, rules out most of the known hypotheses of body size evolution. We propose that the selection toward this body size attractor is driven by the stringent energetic demands of an aquatic lifestyle, which in turn constrain maximum size but allow minimum size.

This temperature-dependent enhancement of rhinovirus replication can be partially rescued by the genetic depletion of the MAVS protein, which is a key signal transducer of the RIG-I–like receptor (RLR) family of innate immune response genes.

We found an increase in the inflammatory cytokines IFNγ, IL-6, TNFα, IL-1β, IL-17, IL-18, IL-21, and IFNγ/IL-17 in the brains of AD patients compared to normal controls. Moreover, the levels of these cytokines in the brains of AD patients were significantly correlated with the severity of the disease. Our data indicate that the intraneuronal release of proinflammatory cytokines precedes the formation of insoluble Aβ plaques and tau aggregates in AD. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are still unclear, but our study provides evidence that neurons are the primary source of the neurodegenerative and proinflammatory process in AD, thus redefining the pathophysiology of the disease.

The study will shed light on the economic use of the chicken in antiquity, as well as the origin and spread of this species in Europe. The talk will address the following questions: When and where did economic exploitation of the chicken take place in the ancient world? Did the earliest economic exploitation of the chicken occur in Europe? When and how did the chicken enter Europe? How did it spread and flourish in Europe? How did it become a major part of the economy in Europe and worldwide? To what extent was it a key element of the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural economy?
It has been suggested that the domestication of the chicken was a key factor for the emergence of agriculture. Chickens were probably domesticated as a result of their economic utility in the Middle East, where they were used as a source of food, skin, eggs, and feathers. However, the exact dates and places where this economic exploitation occurred, and the mechanisms of its spread to Europe, remain obscure. Here we demonstrate that the earliest unequivocal evidence for economic exploitation of the chicken in Europe dates to the first"

The project involves a combination of cryo-electron microscopy and computational modeling of the ribosome to characterize its molecular structure. The study of the ribosome is important because it is a key component of the translation of the genetic code into the biochemistry of living cells. This process is absolutely fundamental to life, and yet the mechanisms of the process are only partially understood. The investigation of the ribosome will reveal molecular detail of how the genetic code is translated into the biochemistry of living cells, and will provide a better understanding of the basis of the origin of life.
To fully understand the function of the ribosome, it is necessary to understand its structure. There are two independent techniques for determining the structure of the ribosome, each of which yields a different perspective. The first is cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), which yields high resolution structure. The second is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which yields lower resolution structure. These two techniques are complementary, and the study of the ribosome with both techniques is necessary"

However, RttA can also be found in the cytoplasm in an inactive form, RttA-I, which is believed to be a nonfunctional or misfolded form of the protein. Since the catalytic function of the protein is important for the survival of the cell, a protein degradation pathway is essential to maintain an appropriate concentration of active protein. However, the specific mechanism of degradation of the inactive form of RttA is unclear. Here we show that an active form of the RttA-I protein is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin ligase RttA-U, which recognizes the ubiquitin ligated form of the protein. This protease has a unique catalytic mechanism that is distinct from other ubiquitin ligases, where the protein is first ubiquitinated in a different site than the recognition site, and then the ubiquitinated protein is degraded.

In collaboration with the Reproductive Biology Laboratory, we have been able to follow spermatozoa from the testis to the female reproductive tract. We find that after being released from the testis, the spermatozoa initially contain a set of proteins associated with sperm motility and virility, and this set of proteins is enriched as spermatozoa make the transition to the female reproductive tract. However, when spermatozoa are stored in the female reproductive tract, they undergo significant compositional changes, and most of the postcopulatory proteins are lost. A sizable fraction of the postcopulatory sperm proteome is replaced by a set of proteins associated with processes such as cell adhesion and phagocytosis. This change in the sperm proteome is consistent with the observation that the male reproductive tract is a relatively hostile environment for sperm. Our work"

Background: The steady-state distribution of normal and cancer cells differs by the number of somatic (e.g., TP53) or germline (e.g., BRCA1/2) mutations, and the cell proliferation rate. Here, we report the largest genome-wide association study of the dynamics of cancer incidence.
Findings: We identified over 1,500 genes that associate with risk of primary cancer. We also discovered the mechanisms by which cell proliferation rate and mutation rate determine cancer incidence. In particular, we show that high cancer incidence is associated with high proliferation rate and low mutation rate, while low cancer incidence is associated with the converse. We find that the effect of mutation rate is highly dependent on cell proliferation rate.
Conclusions: The observed correlation between cancer incidence and cell proliferation rate/mutation rate has a simple molecular explanation: cancer incidence is driven by the balance between cell proliferation and mutation rate.
– although the former is very strongly and causally associated with mutation rate, the latter is only moderately associated with proliferation rate.

See full version: What is the effect of the environment on viral infection and disease?
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a widespread change in lifestyle and behaviour. People are trying to figure out what to do to stay healthy and to not get infected with the coronavirus. The most obvious answer is to stay at home, wash their hands frequently, and not touch their face. However, the environment, especially the air, is a significant source of infections. In our environment, the main route of viral infection is through respiratory droplets. The droplets can be generated by coughing, sneezing, or talking. The duration of the droplets depends on the velocity of the respiratory tract and the viscosity of the droplet. The high-speed flow in the respiratory tract can be modeled by the “vacuum-like” mechanics. The interaction between the fluid (virus) and the environment (e.g., the air) determines the fate of the virus. So far, the effect of the environment on viral transmission has been investigated mainly in the case of aerosols. However, the effect"

The islet-inducing factor, a key transcription factor that is essential for the differentiation of pancreatic islet-like cells in mice, is in the same family of genes as the ABC-transducer of the crypt-associated transcription factor, which is essential for the development of the isthmus-related region of the eye. This region is essential for the development of the photoreceptor, and thus the visual system, in the cat.
The question is, if you don’t believe in a God-given or a purposeful universe, how do you know that something else isn’t behind the events that you see? And if there is a God, how do you know that his or her intent is to let us know about the existence of such a God? In a world of either/or, what’s the third option? Is there a third option?

Here, we show that stimulation of the LH, whether by optogenetic or electrical means, induces eating. Lesion of VTA GABA neurons blunts this effect, whereas stimulation of the LC (another brain region that projects to the VTA) does not. These results establish a central role for VTA GABA neurons in eating behavior and provide the basis for a novel approach to the treatment of obesity.
So far, we’ve seen that the brain is a social organ that depends on both context and learning to make sense of our environment. It turns out that a part of the brain called the ventral tegmental area (VTA) is key to learning about others’ beliefs and intentions. The VTA is a small brain region that sits between the prefrontal cortex and the caudate nucleus. The VTA has been linked to several aspects of social cognition, including empathy, self-control, and moral judgment. Now, a new study from researchers at the University"

The ITC’s Global Forest Watch network enables people to monitor forest cover change remotely and noninvasively and to detect and report illegal deforestation in real time. A recent ITC initiative has enabled some of the network’s early deforestation alerts to be shared with indigenous communities to empower them to monitor and report illegal deforestation in real time and to increase their capacity to manage and protect forested lands. We evaluate the impact of this program in a randomized controlled trial in the Peruvian Amazon. We find that the program reduced deforestation on average by about 5% in the treatment communities in the first year after the program was implemented, compared to a control group, and that the program’s effects were greatest in the most threatened communities. The program increased the number of people in the communities who reported illegal deforestation by about 80%, allowing for a first estimate of the program’s ability to increase the detection of illegal deforestation.

Removing anthropogenic aerosols may save millions of lives, restore rainfall patterns, and limit global warming.
Global warming and anthropogenic aerosols are both anthropogenic, although anthropogenic aerosols are not necessarily the main driver of global warming. The warming effect of aerosols is less than the global warming caused by greenhouse gases, but their impact on rainfall patterns is much larger than that of CO2. Although there are many sources of anthropogenic aerosols, fossil fuel combustion is the main cause. When fossil fuels are burned, aerosol particles are produced, which are mostly fine particles with diameters less than 2.5 μm, referred to as PM2.5. Because of the presence of aerosols in the lower troposphere, global warming is masked, but the warming effect of aerosols is mainly caused by the cooling effect of aerosol-perturbed rainfall patterns. This has severe consequences for water and food security, especially in dry regions. The warming effect of aerosols, however, is greater than that of greenhouse gases, so reducing aerosols would lead to increased warming. The combined effect of greenhouse gases and"

We have known for some time that the emergence of Yersinia pestis from a host of closely related bacterial lineages (pneumonic plague) and from the gut of fleas (bubonic plague) have been key events in the history of human diseases. However, the emergence of the pathogen into human history is poorly understood. Here, we report on the results of a genome sequence analysis of Yersinia pestis that spans from 4,000 to 1,200 y BP (Middle to Late Neolithic/Bronze Age). We find that the emergence of this form of plague is a unique event and that it spread from the Near East to Europe and Asia independently of other forms of the pathogen. We also identify the most parsimonious genetic history of plague, including its origin in the gut of fleas and the domestication of the flea in the Near East. This genetic history is a remarkable feat of adaptation and is a key determinant of its unique evolutionary trajectory.

This work demonstrates the need to recognize and understand the cultural forces that support authoritarianism.
Cultural ideology and political identity are among the most important, and most controversial, factors influencing voting behavior. A central question in the psychological study of politics is whether cultural ideology is particularly influential in supporting authoritarianism. In this study, we examine whether a psychological concept, masculinity-identifying, predicts support for Donald Trump across seven studies of American adults. This concept is an atavistic, “everywhere and nowhere” version of “masculinity”: it is the idea that a man is a man by virtue of his willingness to engage in “masculine” behaviors and attitudes, such as the supposed need to protect, dominate, or dominate, and his lack of concern about the consequences of these behaviors.

Agricultural intensification with tillage and fertilization has resulted in persistent organic carbon (C) loss to the atmosphere, which is now recognized as a major contributor to global climate change. We investigated the potential for ecosystem restoration in agriculture through soil health management practices that enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration, which could offset the rapid loss of SOC to the atmosphere during the Anthropocene. We compared the effects of three common soil health management practices: (i) reduced tillage, (ii) diverse crop rotations with cover crops, and (iii) pastures managed with rotational grazing. Our results reveal that these practices enhance microbial biomass and C-use efficiency, but they do not increase C storage in the top 1 m of soil. These results demonstrate that it is critical to consider soil health management practices in the context of soil management system (agricultural vs. pasture) and soil type (Mollisols vs. less-weathered soils) when implementing soil health management practices to mitigate climate change.

Based on spectroscopic and isotopic fingerprinting, we identify nesocodin as a red pigment that is probably responsible for attracting hummingbirds. We show that a single enzyme is sufficient for nesocodin production, and we identify three enzymes that are either necessary or sufficient for the red coloration of nectar. We hypothesize that red pigments play a similar function in pollination as does color in human vision. In this regard, we provide the first molecular evidence for convergence in the evolution of an important and widespread trait in vertebrate-pollinated plants.

It was also a period of remarkable demographic change, during which many European populations were affected by migrations of immigrants from the Near East, the Caucasus, Siberia, and beyond. Our ancient DNA analysis reveals that these demographic processes resulted in a marked reduction in genetic diversity in Europe, and particularly in women. The genetic signatures of population structure, admixture, and selection are detectable in present-day European populations. However, it is not yet known whether these demographic processes are reflected in the extant human genome. The present analyses, which include the first genetic analysis of the “early” Middle Ages, reveal that women in particular show remarkable genetic diversity and that this diversity is reflected in their visible appearance.

This is a very nice paper that provides the first evidence for the presence of a novel telomere-copying activity in humans. It is not without a few caveats. I.e., the pol δ activity in humans is limited to the lagging strand of DNA. It is not clear whether the pol δ activity is necessary for normal cellular function and health. The pol δ activity in the human is more like that in yeast, which is not essential for normal function, but it can cause errors in the replication of the lagging strand.

(1) The origin of life is the most important unsolved problem in science. The RNA world hypothesis is the only serious scientific theory that can explain how the first living systems emerged on the planet. It is compatible with the best available evidence and is supported by a large number of specific predictions about the processes of origin of life. In addition, it provides a generic and easily testable theory of the origin of life in the laboratory, which has been demonstrated in an attempt to reproduce the key steps in the emergence of the first life on earth. The RNA world hypothesis is a robust and comprehensive theory of the origin of life, and it explains the origin of several major properties of life, including the ability to reproduce and to evolve by natural selection. However, a key problem of the RNA world is that it does not explain the origin of the first living systems. The apparent paradox of the origin of life is that it was necessary to have life to create life.

If you are reading this, you are in the right place to learn about the revolution that is reinventing the very definition of the word “community”: the revolution of “global community,” which is both a catch-all for the biggest economic and social transformations of our time and a necessary condition for our survival. The global community is a term I coined in “The Global Community” (1995) to describe the current crisis of globalization, and the need to transition from a global economy to a global community, in which people, not just companies, can engage in global transactions and create global value. Since then, the global community has been the focus of much of my research.

Treating COVID-19 with tocilizumab
This paper describes the clinical observation of the treatment of COVID-19 by tocilizumab and its mechanism of action. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical outcomes of 20 patients with severe COVID-19 who were treated with tocilizumab in the early stage of disease. The clinical manifestations of the patients and their laboratory results before and after the treatment were recorded. The CT scans were also performed before and after the treatment, and the change of the lesion opacity was observed. The results show that the treatment of severe COVID-19 with tocil"

The human gut harbors a diverse array of bacterial species, and the balance of these communities can be altered by diet, antibiotic therapy, or transplantation of fecal matter from healthy or malnourished individuals. By analyzing fecal samples of over 400 people, we have generated a “gut microbiome atlas” that spans the entire human genome. This atlas has revealed a strong influence of diet on the gut microbiome, with a distinct “Western” pattern of bacterial taxa that correlates with the consumption of high-fat and high-sugar foods. We have also discovered that the gut microbiome of the Hadza hunter-gatherers in Tanzania differs substantially from that of Westerners.

These threats are multifactorial, and include environmental, climatic, and genetical influences. We evaluate how the frequency of late-winter frost (LSF) has affected the distribution and abundance of woody species in the past, present, and future. We investigate the extent to which LSF has been a key driver of ecological changes in temperate forests, and reveal the potential consequences for ecosystems, economies, and societies. We find that while frost has been a key driver of ecological changes in North America, Europe, and Asia, it has been relatively less important in Africa and South America. The rise of LSF has favored the evolution of early leaf-out and leaf-freezing resistance in temperate woody plants, but has been insufficient to drive major evolutionary changes in North America, and more often led to leaves emerging very late in spring. The contrast is due to the large size and diversity of temperate woody species in North America, which made them more resilient to the impacts of LSF. This has important implications for the future.

Simplified version: The dual mechanism of Th17-induced colitis.
In contrast to their canonical roles in innate immunity, it was found that Th17 cells are also essential to the pathogenesis of some types of autoimmunity. In colitis, a subset of Th17 cells (IL-17A+ cells) is pathogenic, whereas a subset (IL-17A- cells) is essential for control of pathogenic Th1 cells. These findings indicate that the development of colitis requires the transition of Th17 cells from an “antagonistic” to a “supportive” phenotype. In contrast to the Th1-like phenotype, IL-17A- phenotype Th17 cells do not express the transcription factors necessary for development of Th1 cells (i.e., Stat4 and T-bet). Moreover, IL-17A- phenotype Th17 cells are required for the development of Th1 cells via the production of IL-22, an essential cytokine for the development of T-bet-expressing Th1 cells.

In turn, the numerous variations of human pathogenicity are determined by the immune response, which is modulated by the gut microbiota. The molecular basis for this has eluded us. Here, we demonstrate that the human pathogen B. burgdorferi affects the gut microbiota of the vector I. scapularis, leading to the adaptive up- or down-regulation of several genes in the tick microbiome. In particular, B. burgdorferi up-regulates the expression of the tick IAFGP, which encodes a protein that inhibits the development of a bacterial biofilm. The tick microbiota is thus altered in the presence of B. burgdorferi, and the bacteria are therefore more readily taken up by the tick. We demonstrate that the tick IAFGP is also essential for transmission of the human pathogen B. quintana.

However, a majority of these species are fragmentary or only known from isolated remains, making their relationship to living birds uncertain. We present an exceptionally preserved fossil of a basal pygostylian, Jinguofortis perplexus, from the Early Cretaceous of China, which helps us understand the mosaic evolution of birds. The fossil shows the earliest known evidence of a fused scapulocoracoid in birds, which is an important flight-related characteristic of modern birds. It also shows the earliest known evidence of reduction in manual digits in birds, which likely reflects the transition from tetrapod to avian locomotion. This fossil demonstrates that the evolution of flight was accompanied by more general changes in the morphology of the avian body plan, including the transformation of the hindlimb into the primary means of locomotion. The fossil also highlights the importance of developmental plasticity for understanding the mosaic evolution of birds.

Using an isotope-enhanced proxy of the atmospheric CO2 concentration, we have found that a major mass extinction was accompanied by a global CO2 increase of ∼20 ppm. This carbon isotope signal is the strongest signal in the carbon isotope record, which extends over the last half billion years and spans a range of extinctions and mass extinction events. The trigger of the Permian-Triassic extinction is poorly understood, but the CO2 signal and other carbon isotope signals provide an important context for understanding and interpreting the chronology and causes of the event.

We find that fire is an important driver of the carbon cycle and that fire suppression can have significant impacts on climate. We estimate that fire suppression has the same effect on climate as reducing global CO2 emissions by 10 to 20%. We also show that changes in fire regime can be as important as climate change in determining future carbon cycle feedbacks.
Preliminary version: Our research reveals a complex, coupled Earth system that is being impacted by human activities. We find that fire, the most important ecosystem disturbance regime, has been a key driver of climate change in the last half-century, but may now be playing a role of counteracting warming. Climate change and fire are tightly coupled. In the Anthropocene, fire has been a major contributor to the anthropogenic carbon cycle, but our current understanding of fire-climate feedbacks is incomplete. The unprecedented fire activity of the last decade has produced unprecedented uncertainty in the global carbon cycle, and has presented us with a unique opportunity to understand the"

We show that a specific host-derived carbohydrate, chitin, is metabolized by the host’s immune cells in a distinct temporal pattern. This temporal pattern is essential for the establishment of a mutually beneficial symbiosis, which is sustained by the host’s provision of the carbohydrate and the symbiont’s catabolism of the carbohydrate. We propose that other animal hosts may similarly regulate the activities of epithelium-associated microbial communities through the strategic provision of specific nutrients, whose catabolism modulates conditions like pH or anoxia in their symbionts’ habitat.

Have you ever heard about the man who killed his wife because she had a girlfriend? Here’s a story I heard from a friend: “He’d always been a little too much for her. He loved his wife, but she was too much of a lesbian for him. Finally, he’d had enough. So he went to the police and told them that his wife was having a lesbian affair, and he’d killed her.”

We provide evidence that the Middle East harbored a large reservoir of Y. pestis, and the subsequent transport of Y. pestis to Europe led to repeated plague outbreaks. Our analysis is based on a combination of genomics, paleoclimatology, and paleobotany.
c) If it had been possible to observe, compare, and distinguish between the two pandemic events, we would have seen that the number of Y. pestis lineages was not constant during the two pandemics, but rather increased during the Medieval plague pandemic, the so-called “catastrophic” pandemic, which killed the highest number of people. We think this is because the rat population was already decimated by the previous pandemic, and the rats that survived the crisis had to repopulate from a smaller population, and thus, the pathogen-to-host ratio increased.

Virus-sized material that can be isolated from symptomatic and asymptomatic asteroids, as well as from other organisms, represents a highly virulent pathogen with epidemic potential, as has been previously observed for measles, dengue, and Ebola. SSaDV is ubiquitous in the North Pacific and therefore is a candidate for the cause of the SSWD epidemic.

We demonstrate that the use of an antibody in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor is an efficient strategy to induce AML regression.
The ability to harness the immune system to fight cancer has been a dream for over a hundred years. The application of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in the clinic to treat cancer has been a big step forward in this direction. However, these CAR T cells have been shown to produce side effects, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS), cytokine storm, and in the worst cases, death. We show that the combination of an antibody targeting the IL-1 receptor with a CAR T cell has a strong anti-tumor effect in mice with an aggressive form of AML. The combination of these two types of T cell elicits an immune response that is specific to the cancer and does not cause side effects.

I propose that a fundamental and ubiquitous aspect of the information-processing architecture of the nervous system is its ability to integrate information over time. This is the case, for example, in the domain of language where the meaning of words depends on the order in which they are strung together. This is a consequence of the fact that the meaning of words is not only related to the meaning of the word by itself, but also to the meanings of the words that come before and after it. This, in turn, is not only a function of the meaning of the words, but also of the grammatical rules for their ordering. As a consequence of this complex, non-linear, and non-add"

We present the most comprehensive analysis to date of soil respiration in 27 diverse biomes, encompassing >10,000 data points from 1,350 studies, to examine the sensitivity of soil respiration to climatic warming. We found no significant effect of warming on the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration, in contrast to the results of many previous studies. Instead, across biomes, soil respiration increased with temperature up to a threshold of ∼25 °C, after which respiration decreased with further warming. Thus, soil respiration is likely to be highly sensitive to climate warming in the near future, although the magnitude of the response is likely to be less than anticipated in many current climate models.
The ratio of carbon stored in the soil to the total global carbon budget is only about 1/10th, so understanding the controls on soil carbon is critical for understanding the carbon cycle. Soil respiration is the single largest flux of carbon from terrestrial ecosystems, accounting for about 50% of the net carbon flux from land to atmosphere.

We can imagine a similar history in the past that initiated the transition to obligate parasitism in the evolution of the mitochondrion.
The number of genes in the genome (gene number) has a profound effect on the evolution of the genome. In particular, the genome size correlates with the duration of the species’ existence. For instance, as expected from the neutral theory, the number of genes in the genome is related to the time since the beginning of the evolution of life. The hypothesis is further supported by the observation that the gene number correlates with the number of species in the tree of life. This result can be explained by the fact that the number of species is controlled by the rate of evolution of the genome, and the number of genes is controlled by the selection pressure on the genome"

Using the data from the largest cross-national study of news consumption to date, we reveal that, on average, people are more likely to consume and be influenced by negative news content. This is true for both the type of content consumed (e.g., news about wars and violence, terrorism, etc.) and the country in which the person lives. We also find that people who consume more negative news are more likely to support fascist, authoritarian, and xenophobic political parties and candidates. This suggests that the more people consume negative news, the more likely they are to vote for politicians and parties that represent a threat to democracy.
“In this talk I will reveal the extent to which people are influenced by their news consumption in terms of their voting behavior and political attitudes. Our results show that, in a given country, the more people consume negative news content, the more likely they are to vote for authoritarian, fascist, and xenophobic candidates and parties.

The genetic and molecular basis of this disease has been understood for almost a century, and the therapeutic challenge is to attenuate store-operated Ca2+ entry in patients with Stormorken syndrome.

In this talk, we reveal the role of lipids in the emergence of zoonotic diseases. We identified a new protein, Myotis pilosus aminopeptidase (MTX) that is highly concentrated in the salivary gland of bats, a major reservoir of zoonotic pathogens, and is implicated in viral infection. MTX inhibits the host’s antiviral immune response by inhibiting the function of the enzyme leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (LTA4H), which is critical in maintaining the antiviral function of leukotriene B4 (LTB4). We show that MTX is highly expressed in bats, and the LTA4H–MTX interaction is a critical factor in the emergence of zoonotic viruses.

This metabolite is also a substrate for the biosynthesis of serotonin (5-HT), an important neurotransmitter in the brain. Our results reveal that some DLBCL cell lines are particularly sensitive to SHMT1/2 inhibition. The molecular basis of these effects is a defect in mitochondrial glycine uptake by the SHMT1/2-deficient DLBCL cells. We discuss the possibility that this defect may also be at the root of the multiple defects in glucose uptake and glycolysis (ATP-depleting phenotype) of these cells.

We have analyzed the composition of these inclusions and shown that the aggregated proteins have, in general, supersaturated concentrations, as do the native interaction partners of these proteins. This observation is consistent with the understanding that the aggregation-prone proteins are metastable in motor neurons, and that the disease-affected proteins are able to self-assemble into inclusions via a process analogous to the mechanism of supersaturation in colloidal solutions. This finding provides a unifying mechanistic explanation for the occurrence of these inclusions and the associated neurodegeneration. This mechanistic insight can lead to the identification of new therapeutically relevant targets.

Two primary approaches exist for achieving net positive force: first, via a moving target trap or optical tweezers, and second, via a light source and optical-field control. The simplest method, which is the electron-photon scattering approach, can be realized in a photonic crystal, while the more complex, but more efficient, approach of optical tweezers is not. Optical tweezers have been used for studying atom-atom interactions, and the field is now moving to atom-atom trapping and manipulation. The study of atom-atom interactions is a field where optical tweezers are already in use, and the study of atom–photon scattering is a field where optical tweezers are still being developed.

We find that B19 evolved from a common ancestor that was ∼12.6 thousand years old. The divergence between the ancestral and the first-generation B19V genotype was ∼10.8 thousand years, and the rate of evolution was ∼4x lower than inferred previously.

To study these mechanisms, we utilize the tautofish, which is the only animal species to maintain a co-evolved mutualism with V. fischeri. Using an integrated molecular, genetic, and behavioral approach, we are studying the regulation of this mutualism. In addition to the role of light, we are interested in the role of host-derived metabolites that are required for symbiont survival.

Adolescent learning is the central issue in American schools, and it’s the main reason for the racial and gender disparities in school discipline. And the emotional climate of the classroom is the most important factor affecting learning.
This isn’t because students are either good or bad. It’s because they come to school with different temperaments and different levels of resilience. They also come from different circumstances. But it’s always the same: if you teach, you’ll always have some students with bad temperaments, and if you teach, you’ll always have some students with bad circumstances.

To determine how proteolytic enzymes regulate viral tropism, we blocked the first cleavages using an amino acid–binding protein and thereby blocked virus entry into human airway epithelial and lung-derived cells. These protease-blocking mutations, which also altered virus fitness, were more readily tolerated in lung-derived cells than in airway epithelial cells. The presence of abundant proteases in the airway epithelium would allow the virus to evolve resistance to these proteases, but the virus’s rapid replication and transmission to other hosts would limit its fitness in the absence of these proteases. Thus, the presence of these proteases in the lung and airway epithelium is a combination of adaptation and natural selection.
Proteases are integral to the replication and dissemination of many viruses. While the basic mechanism of proteolytic regulation is well understood, the specific proteases that regulate virus fitness in vivo are not well characterized. In this study, we used the MERS-CoV to dissect the roles of proteases in virus–host interactions. We"

In particular, hypoxic edema is induced by activation of astrocyte CRFR1, which triggers astrocyte cAMP/PKA, and the downstream activation of PKCε and AQP4. We also found that CRF and CRFR1 are expressed in the brain, and CRFR1 is involved in the development of cerebral edema in ischaemic stroke. We suggest that this mechanistic understanding could help the development of therapeutic targets for cerebral edema.

A very similar situation arises when we try to explain the data we have, such as when we try to understand the genome. The “genome” of data is not a fixed entity, but rather a complex set of causal structures. A single protein can have many functions, depending on the cellular context. The same goes for the genetic code. What we can do is to use a variety of methods to obtain the “genome” of data, which is more like a spectrum of data structures than a single “genome.” This spectrum of data structures is not fixed, but we can change it, and we can learn how to use it to answer the question of what is the best fit.

This finding is consistent with many classic theories of urban change, which are often based on a simplistic view of cities as comprising homogeneous populations of like-minded people. We also find that the areas of the city that are growing fastest are disproportionately inhabited by college-educated adults and that the effect is stronger for places with higher rates of college-educated adults.

Our study shows that the corals adapt their physiology during heat stress to maintain the balance between the energy demand of the corals and the photosynthetic productivity of the symbionts. This is achieved through a shift of the carbon allocation from the corals to the algal symbionts. However, such a strategy is not sufficient to save the coral from extinction, since the algal symbionts are unable to meet the metabolic demands of the coral. Thus, the ability of the corals to adapt to their changing environment is limited by the ability of the symbionts to maintain their photosynthetic productivity.

The decomposition of water is the result of several factors, including the influence of the electrolyte, electrolyte additives, and electrolyte composition. The decomposition of water causes the electrolyte to become highly corrosive, which limits the use of aqueous electrolytes in batteries. The"

We first take the “big picture” from the genome-scale analysis of gene expression changes in the regenerating C. elegans CNS, and we subsequently address the details of a single neuron’s intrinsic regenerative capacity. We find that in Drosophila, an activity-dependent mechanism controlling the CNS’s intrinsic regenerative capacity is the homologous, activity-dependent “elongation/mitosis balance.” In mammals, we have identified the mammalian version of this mechanism, the “mitotic bistable stem cell–like state,” which acts as a “resting” mechanism for the adult brain. We argue that this mechanism is a major contributor to the mammalian brain’s unique capacity for generating new neurons in response to physical damage, and we propose that the regenerative capacity of the adult mammalian CNS is the result of a balance between the “mitotic bistable stem cell–like state” and its opposite, “cell cycle arrest.”

This is because, as with most of biology, selection operates on the most fundamental unit of evolutionary time, the genome. The implications of this fundamental unit of selection are profound. We show that selection at the level of the genome can have dramatic effects on the nature of selection, including the balance between adaptive and deleterious selection. We also show that selection at the level of the genome is the primary mechanism that drives the evolution of genomic traits. This contrasts with a model in which selection operates at the level of the phenotypic, organismal, or even population level. We show that the latter view is not only mistaken, but that it may actually be a hindrance to understanding evolution. We also show that the fact that selection acts on the genome is important for the evolutionary biology of the genomes of organisms.

We used PET to investigate the functional organization of the brain in PD and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) subjects, and found significant differences in the topology of the brain networks in these diseases. In PD, we observed a significant loss of the DMN-like functional connectivity, which was partially corrected by dopaminergic therapy. In AD, the loss of network expression was observed at diagnosis.

How Plants and Parasites Time Their Reproduction to Maximize Fitness
Modern plant-parasite interactions are rife with examples of the evolution of complex adaptations that have facilitated the transformation of one group of organisms into parasites of another. One key feature of these adaptations is the capacity of the parasites to manipulate their hosts’ physiology and behavior to enhance their own fitness. This has led to the hypothesis that parasites evolved to be specialized parasites in a highly specialized niche. However, this view is challenged by the fact that parasites have also evolved to be highly generalist parasites, exploiting a wide range of hosts and habitats. This talk will describe the evolution of plant parasites, which have evolved the capacity to exploit a wide range of hosts, and the implications this has for our understanding of plant-parasite"

Answer:
In the human brain, there are many important functions that help us make decisions and control our actions. One of these functions is the ability to choose between different options. Scientists have been studying how the brain helps us make these choices and have made an interesting discovery. They found that there are certain areas in the brain called striosomes that play a big role in decision-making. These striosomes are like the command center of the brain, telling us what to do and helping us make the right choices.

When we want to make a decision, our brain sends signals to different parts of our body. It's like sending a message to a computer. The signals travel through our nerves and reach the striosomes in the brain"

Experiment 1: The book “whatever happened to the happy ever after?” examines the effect of the speed of responding on the perception of social connection between two people, and whether this can be used as a readout of how well people are connected.
Summary: The present paper investigates whether the speed of responding is used by people to infer the strength of connection between two people. To this end, we experimentally manipulated the speed of responding between participants and had them rate the strength of connection between them. We found that faster response times were perceived as more connected than slower response times. Furthermore, this was also true even when the two people involved in the conversation had no more in common than two people who did not know each other. This effect is robust to a variety of conditions, including the number of people involved, the length of the conversation, the kind of task, and whether or not the participants were interacting through an avatar or face-to-face. These results suggest that the speed of responding can be a"

Why We Need to Think Big in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology

“If you want to save the world, you need to think big.”
We are in the midst of a global biodiversity crisis. Some of the most spectacular examples of this crisis are the massive declines in insect abundance and diversity, and the extinction of iconic species such as the monarch butterfly. These events have triggered alarm bells, and we are beginning to understand the ecological and evolutionary processes that drive them. But they are only the tip of the iceberg.
The current crisis is a manifestation of a much larger problem: the inability to predict the consequences of human actions in ecological systems, especially in the presence of uncertainty. We are making decisions with a blind eye to the consequences, and we are"

Alkylglycerol monooxygenase activity modulation affected the expression of multiple enzymes and regulatory proteins involved in IFN-γ/lipopolysaccharide signaling, thereby demonstrating that the ternary lipidome is tightly linked to the cytokine signaling pathway.

We imagine that the brain functions like a computer that stores information in binary variables. In this picture, the inputs to the brain are the bits that we feed into the computer. The neuronal hardware of the brain is the physical structure that stores these bits. The software is a set of algorithms that drives the physical hardware to perform computations. But what if the brain does not store information in bits? What if the brain stores information in adaptable conductances that change over time, much like the current hardware-software concept of memristors?

However, the delivery of RNA to plants faces a major challenge: the delivery efficiency. This is mainly due to the absence of a lipid bilayer in plant cells, which is absent in mammalian cells and essential for biomolecule delivery. Here, we show that DNA nanostructures can be used to deliver siRNAs to plants, and the internalization efficiency of the nanostructures correlates with their respective gene silencing efficiencies. We further show that the endogenous gene silencing pathway in plants depends on the siRNA attachment locus on the nanostructure. Our work establishes the feasibility of biomolecule delivery to plants with DNA nanostructures and both details the design parameters of importance for plant cell internalization and also assesses the impact of DNA nanostructure geometry for gene silencing mechanisms.

We found that the 6 largest tributaries account for ∼70% of the daily load, but contribute only ∼25% of the total nitrogen and phosphorus. However, many tributaries contribute disproportionately high loads of bioavailable nutrients. In contrast to the “rich get richer” pattern in larger watersheds, the relatively high loads of bioavailable N and P in small tributaries suggest that these streams may be more vulnerable to eutrophication than previously thought. Our results demonstrate the need to expand current nutrient management efforts to protect the ecological integrity of valuable nearshore ecosystems.
Theoretical and conceptual developments over the past two decades have led to a burgeoning interest in the role of nutrients in global change. This interest has been especially focused on the “new paradigm” of global eutrophication, in which nutrients are seen as the driving factor in the excessive growth of phy"

We show that the EEG itself can be used as a proxy measure of the underlying brain function, and we use this insight to infer and visualize the causal role of excitatory neurotransmitter-receptor interactions in generating episodic discharges in the living brain. We use the experience of treating epileptic patients and of recording from the brain in the laboratory to understand the complex mechanisms of the symptomatic seizures. We find that the brain has a built-in mechanism, where a certain balance between the inhibitory and excitatory inputs is required for a stable, well-behaved neuronal network. If this balance is disrupted, the brain may resort to a chaotic regime, where certain activity patterns may occur in bursts (e.g., theta bursts, epileptiform discharges). We first show that this mechanism can be exploited to generate stable, well-behaved, and brain-like oscillatory activity patterns that can be recorded from the brain, and then we use these patterns to extract a set of rules for the generation of epileptiform discharges in the living brain.

The Earth has a long history of episodic warming, including warm periods of no more than a decade, or even less. However, the magnitude and duration of these warm events is not entirely understood, and it is increasingly apparent that the planet has been rapidly cooling during the current epoch. Our studies suggest that carbon cycling and planetary habitability were highly sensitive to the rate and extent of global warming during an episode ∼200,000 y ago.
The human–Earth system is in a transitional period, where technological civilization is enabling rapid and pervasive changes in our relationship to our biosphere. While the consequences of this transition are still being assessed, it is clear that the Earth system has been altered by human activities and is not returning to the Holocene conditions of ∼10,000 y ago, including climate.
From an ecological perspective, the Anthropocene represents an incipient extinction event, with some species disappearing and others spreading. The consequences of this transition are still being assessed, but the anthropogenic influence on the Earth system is now clear. The carbon cycle is an important component of the human"

Conservation certification, often based on the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, has been an effective means of achieving these incentives. However, we show that the impact of certification on deforestation is limited, because certification has been widely adopted, and the incentives of certified companies are undermined by the lack of strict requirements on forest protection and the lack of monitoring of forest cover loss. Certification’s limited impact on deforestation has not been documented before because no comprehensive dataset of plantation and forest loss was available. We combine satellite-derived measures of deforestation and fire in oil palm plantations in Indonesia with a unique dataset of RSPO certification status and oil palm plantation areas from 2001 to 2015. We show that certification has reduced deforestation rates by about 33%. However, certification has not significantly reduced forest loss in Indonesia’s tropical forests. Deforestation was already declining prior to certification, and the speed of the decline was not affected by certification. Certification was also ineffective in forested regions, where deforestation had already been reduced by about 75% in the decade before certification. Certification’s limited impact on deforestation may have been due to a lack of strict requirements on forest protection,"

In plants and animals, the actin cytoskeleton plays a critical role in motility, morphogenesis, and cell polarity. In addition, cytoskeletal dynamics and its misregulation are implicated in human diseases, such as cancer. We discover that a recently identified protein, esitetarine, is a specific inhibitor of the last steps of exocytosis in both plants and animals. This protein inhibits the cytoskeletal actin-binding protein (CytB) activity, which is essential for the transport of cargo to the plasma membrane and the establishment of a vesicle-trafficking pathway. Our investigation provides a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms of exocytosis and the consequences of its inhibition. We also provide a potential drug candidate, esitetarine, for treating cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.

We explore the consequences of polygenic sex determination in the African cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii, which has a polygenic sex determination system involving two genes (cis and trans). The interaction of these two sex determination alleles can produce four possible sex classes with two phenotypic extremes: male (ZWXY), female (ZZXX), male-like (ZWXX), or female-like (ZZXY). We show that the presence or absence of the sex determination genes has a broad impact on the distribution of secondary sexual characteristics, ranging from the number of anal fin rays to the shape of the caudal fin. We also show that the sex determination system in M. mbenjii is remarkably flexible, such that it can be directly linked to the evolution of multiple phenotypic axes, resulting in an unusually high degree of modularity in the evolution of sex determination.

In the absence of antioxidant defences, these radicals can cause oxidative stress and damage to photoreceptors and photoreceptor-supporting retinal cells. A class of natural antioxidants, carotenoids, can protect photoreceptors against oxidative stress, and several carotenoid-metabolizing enzymes are known to exist in the retina. In the context of retinitis pigmentosa, the carotenoid aldehyde retinaldehyde (RetAld) is often seen as a marker of retinoid metabolism. We sought to investigate whether the carotenoid metabolism in the retina was impaired in retinitis pigmentosa, and whether the retinaldehyde/retinol ratio (RTR) in the retina could be used as a biomarker of disease progression in retinitis pigmentosa. We show that a significant increase in the RTR in the retina was observed in retinitis pigmentosa, and that this biomarker could be used to monitor disease progression.

In this talk, we show that the study of morphological evolution in the animal kingdom, and more generally the evolution of feeding specializations, can be understood as a fundamental mechanism of adaptive radiations, in which specializations are co-opted from one prey type to another. This finding extends the understanding of prey capture specializations to the widest possible range of taxa and provides a mechanistic explanation of why natural selection has favored specialization in some species and generalization in others. We provide an example of the evolution of predatory specializations in cnidarians, and we present a toolkit for understanding the co-evolution of morphology and function in diverse taxa.
Evolution and Taxonomy
Specialization and diversification of prey capture mechanisms are ubiquitous in the animal kingdom. The most extreme case is the evolution of predatory specializations in cnidarians, which includes the transition from filter feeding to predation. However, most organisms have evolved prey capture specializations that are not as extreme as the siphonophores. In this talk, we focus on the evolution of the most common type of prey capture specializations: the"

This study is the first to document the presence of a hypospadian metacarpal styloid process in a fossil hominin from the Middle Pleistocene, the earliest unequivocal evidence for this feature in the human hand. Because the metacarpal styloid process is one of the most distinctive features that distinguish Homo from other hominins, the finding of this primitive version of the human hand provides direct evidence for the evolution of the human hand and of our ancestors’ technology and behavioral capacities.
One of the most important questions in human evolution is the evolution of the human hand. The evolution of the human hand has been a major driver of the evolution of human behavior and technology, as the human hand is uniquely capable of forming complex shapes and movements and of making and using tools. This is because the human hand is unique among hominins in having an opposable thumb, a strong intrinsic grip strength, a large surface area of the palm, and an opposable index finger.

We have discovered a class of cytotoxic drugs that inhibit p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and we will test whether these drugs can kill cancer cells.

We found that this effect was particularly pronounced for fruit and vegetables, and we found that this effect was present in contexts where people were food insecure or vulnerable to food insecurity. The causal effect of deforestation on fruit and vegetable consumption is thus not inevitable, and in fact can be reversed or at least mitigated by appropriate policies. We find that the opportunity to achieve both conservation and nutrition goals is important for policy makers, and that strategies to support the latter should explicitly consider the former.
