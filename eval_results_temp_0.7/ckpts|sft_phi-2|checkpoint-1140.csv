Above 300 K, the excitons are able to leak into the D2O lattice and are converted into “intermediate” states having a vacuum transition energy of about 20 kcal/mol. This is enough to push the electrons from the highest excited state to the lowest one and hence to increase the electric polarizability of the atoms to a proton where the interaction with the 3D electron orbitals of water molecules is of the order of ˜ 0.1 eV. This goes a long way to explain the (relative) stability of this state transition. The transition energy of the (electrical) exciton can be adjusted by the temperature and by the magnetic field, but the only way to affect the atom-orbital interaction is to change the composition of the medium.

This is not a conventional ontology of math, but a continuum in which the only option is to let it live or die. With the exception of a few bits and pieces, such as the QFT, it is not even an attempt to kill the other.
The link between the two may be found in the sense that the former is a mere abstraction of the latter. The former is a holotype of the latter. It is a mere feature of a far more complex fabric of phenomena. The latter is not a pure abstraction from which the former is deduced.
It is apparent that mathematics can generate a paucity of such links. It is more difficult to establish a “mere feature of a far more complex fabric” link. This is why the latter is more complex than the former. It is also why the former is not a mere abstraction of the latter.
The last point is exemplified by the fact that the latter is not merely an abstraction but a richly connected fabric of phenomena. The former is a mere abstraction of that fabric. It is easier to establish a link between the former and the latter in a one-to-"

The body plan of myxozoans has been replaced by an entirely different body plan that has been radically simplified by extreme genome and gene reduction. The transformation of a free-living organism into a parasitic one was likely as simple as a switch of genetic packages. Our analysis of a large number of myxozoan genomes supports a simplification of the genome and gene content in these parasites and may help to explain the remarkable evolutionary transition from free-living organisms to parasites.
Motivation: The evolution from free-living organisms to parasites is one of the most dramatic evolutionary transitions that has been observed in nature. Surprisingly, the molecular basis of this radical transition is still unknown. Myxozoans are a group of cnidarians that have evolved by undergoing a radical existential transition. They are free-living and have lost key features of the cnidarian body plan, but retain the ancestral developmental and tissue morphogenetic features.

This is consistent with the anti-IFN activity of the viral genomes of other coronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the related betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2.

In this talk, we will present the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We will discuss how Zn2+ binding to Hv1 can be explained by the dual effect of Zn2+ on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction, and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1.
Association of Zn(II) with the Hv1 voltage sensor channel and its potential effect on sperm motility will be discussed. It is important to clarify the relationship between Hv1 and sperm motility because Hv1 channels play an important role in sperm motility. For example, a mutation in the Hv1 channel of male mice results in azoospermia. Understanding the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of H"

Metaphorical and literal “monkey see, monkey do” paradigms suggest that humans and other primates have evolved similar cognitive mechanisms to process visual content. This assumption has been shown to be false in several species, where a number of cognitive mechanisms are uniquely tuned to the needs of the species and its ecological niche. Here, we investigate the neural computations underlying the perception of motion of naturalistic scenes in the common marmoset. In contrast to the paradigm-driven studies in humans, we show that the marmoset’s motion perception is not tuned to the ensembles of natural images. Instead, it uses a hierarchical model that is specific to the"

However, the US is experiencing an unprecedented collapse in employment, but we estimate about one-third of the drop in employment is due to COVID-19, and about two-thirds due to the Great Recession. The overall contribution of COVID-19 is likely to be about half of the Great Recession. We find that the government has spent about $1.1 trillion in the first quarter of 2020.

The world’s total plastic waste is estimated at 100 to 300 billion tons and increasing at a rate of about eight to twelve million tons per year, representing 5% of the total human production of synthetic macromolecules. The cumulative amount of plastic in the environment is increasing exponentially, while the rate of its degradation is slow and cannot be regulated by natural processes. Because of its presence in the environment, plastic is a key factor affecting the planet’s natural balance and its inhabitants. The fate of the plastic is to become dispersed in the environment, accumulate in the food chain, and affect human and non-human life. The problem is now not merely a theoretical one. It is already a reality that has to be understood and finally solved.

We also assume that the cosmic ray dose rates of the cosmic ray protons were reduced during this epoch. The cosmic ray dose rates for protons of many hundreds of TeV and nuclei of at least 40 MeV were reduced, but not to the levels of the present universe. The cosmogenic abundances of the cosmogenic nuclides of the individual grains that we analyzed exceed the expected values for the present universe by a factor of at least 10.

We argue it is because humans and other primates are the only mammals that domesticated their own species, and that this domestication, which is largely biological, has caused unprecedented increases in their fitness.
The above image is from the UK. The y-axis represents the mean number of litters born per mother; the x-axis is the major allomaternal form of reproduction—mother-to-infant, allomaternal, or allomaternal–autonomous—for which most adult foraging species practice. The y-axis is the mean number of offspring produced per litter. The nature of domestication is represented by the y-axis, which is scaled to the x-axis. We found that the most efficient reproductive strategy is allomaternal, which is most common among humans, domesticates, and nonhuman primate species. Here, we show that this is the case because human mothering is the most efficient at the allomaternal level. This result is robust to the number of species, years of domestication, and species-specific factors."

The social world is rife with conflict and competition, yet foraging and breeding animals must also reconcile the need to survive and procreate with the need to cooperate or mitigate conflict. Especially in animal societies, the establishment and maintenance of social hierarchy is central to these needs. In particular, subordinate individuals in a position of relative rank must find ways to avoid, defer to, or mitigate the dominance of dominant individuals. In a variety of species, including many primate and rodent species, dominant females or males may exhibit a unique trait that allows them to effectively protect, compete with, or manipulate subordinates. These behaviors may be driven by changes in the amygdala or other brain regions that may also be involved in anxiety. However, the molecular and cellular physiological mechanisms that underlie this process have remained elusive, especially in the context of social dominance.

Why is it so hard to design functionalities for materials that are “only” physical? In an effort to address this question, I’ve been working on defining a set of strategies for creating multi-functional structures and systems by exploiting the unique potentials of different materials and their combinations. To this end, I’ve been combining organic origami/folding techniques with a range of heterogeneous polymeric materials to fabricate morphologically adaptable structures, with a wide range of functionalities. The synthesized hybrid structures include, for example, programmable and adaptive morphing"

However, in a small proportion of humans, the fetal to adult hemoglobin ratio is disrupted. We have identified a putative mechanism by which the IGF2BP1 transcription factor can repress the induction of adult hemoglobin in erythroid cells by repressing the expression of BCL11A.
The mechanism of the fetal to adult hemoglobin reprogramming was tested on the genome-wide scale with transcriptome sequencing of bone marrow-derived hematopoietic cells from a dozen human erythroid cases, including three sets of twins: maternally inherited (ma-tet-a), heterotet-a, and identical twins (i-tet-a). Erythroid chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing was used to identify and quantify changes in gene expression associated with the reversal of the fetal to adult hemoglobin reprogramming. Thirty-three differentially expressed genes were identified, which included multiple genes known to be involved in the regulation of adult hemoglobin expression. The expression-quantification analysis was further validated with RNA-sequencing analysis of peripheral blood mon"

In this study, we found that the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway-dependent up-regulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) mediated by stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) not only confers ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells, but also synergistically promotes ferroptosis induction. We investigated the therapeutic potential of combining mTORC1 inhibitors with ferroptosis-inducing agents in cancer, and found in vitro that this combination caused near-complete tumor regression in xenograft mouse models for PI3K-mutated breast cancer and PTEN-defective prostate cancer. Our results open up a novel therapeutic strategy for cancer, which combines inhibition of mTORC1 with ferroptosis induction to synergistically kill cancer cells.

The voltage-gated Ca2+ channel, Cav1.2, is the major regulator of intracellular Ca2+ concentration and is also the major target of LCCBs. We have recently discovered that SOCE-dependent Beta2-adrenoceptor activation by LCCBs is mediated by STIM. STIM, which is up-regulated during cardiovascular remodeling, is a major regulator of Cav1.2 localization. STIM is a calcium sensor that is up-regulated in hypertensive rats, and STIM1, a STIM homolog, is up-regulated in the heart and vascular smooth muscle of hypertensive rats. Our data strongly suggest that LCCBs, the most popular antihypertensive drugs, promote cardiovascular remodeling, and that STIM-mediated activation of Orai is the major mechanism of action of LCCBs. Our findings have important implications for the use of LCCBs in elderly patients or patients with cardiovascular remodeling.

The North American forest has undergone a rapid transformation to early-seral ecosystems that are characterized by the dominance of smaller trees and the loss of large, old-growth trees. The consequences of this transformation are seen in the ecological and economic consequences of the loss of old-growth forest. This transformation is mirrored by the loss of ecologically important birds, which are declining at an accelerating rate. The North American Bird Conservation Act (NABCA) is one of the few attempts to restore the structure of the forest. However, despite the establishment of the program in the early 1960s, bird populations have continued to decline. Our analysis indicates that the decline is accelerating while the program is already more than 60 years old, as is true with many other long-term programs in ecology. This suggests that the program has failed to restore the forest structure necessary for the long-term persistence of bird populations. We show that the decline of early-seral bird populations is due to the loss of old-growth forest. This loss is due to the continuing shift"

In contrast to congenital CTLA-4 deficiency, which can cause severe disease and early death, CTLA-4 is not essential for the survival of mice with acquired CTLA-4 loss. However, CTLA-4-deficient mice are not protected against the development of autoimmune disease, as previously reported for congenitally deficient mice. Instead, we have shown that CTLA-4-deficient mice are protected against two central autoimmune diseases, EAE and multiple sclerosis (MS)–like disease in the CNS. These findings imply that the CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cell–mediated suppression of autoimmune disease is not due to the deficiency of CTLA-4, but is a consequence of more general abrogation of central tolerance with severe consequences in the peripheral immune system.

This is believed to result from a combination of increasing rates of extinction, e.g. due to anthropogenic climate change, and a failure of evolution to keep up with novel threats to extant species. It is therefore concerning that we do not understand the evolutionary origins of biodiversity. Although there has been extensive research on the origin of mammals, the origin of anomalous animals has received scant attention. The remarkable exception is the origin of insects, and specifically beetles, and the evolution of a wide array of specialist plant feeding adaptations. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the genetic and genomic data on the origin of beetles, including the timing of diversification and the emergence of new ecological niches and feeding adaptations. We use this information to reconstruct the evolutionary history of beetles, which has been incompletely known.
There are a number of broad correlations between the paucity of pre-Anthropocene extinctions and the numbers of extant species in each taxon, as well as the abundance, diversity, and rate of evolution.

It’s been hard to not be impressed by the recent progress in the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, its variants, and their antigens.

Although the initial success of these vaccines is to be celebrated, the observed emergence of several variants of concern (VOCs), including the Delta variant, has raised the concern that such variants could escape the effectiveness of these vaccines, and viral evolution may be imminent. Thus, the need for a more flexible and adaptive approach to the development of vaccines, coupled with a rapid and inexpensive platform for such an approach, is more important than ever.

We carry out a large-scale experiment with five, twenty-four to thirty-five, or more than 400 participants to investigate the role of trial-and-error learning in artifact evolution. We find that populations of up to 200,000 participants can learn to build better planes, but only when trial-and-error learning is enabled.

This top-down control is thought to work in concert with bottom-up sensory processing to mediate behavior. Despite decades of effort, the brain’s computational mechanisms and their neural representations remain substantially mysterious. We analyze data from the mapping of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to cognitive behavior, identifying a highly constrained number of regions, many of which are located in the orbitofrontal cortex. Importantly, the brains of typical humans exhibit a precisely known, nearly identical pattern of brain-behavior associations. These associations are a consequence of the deep learning of experience, rather than the product of top-down control. The artificial intelligence research community has been studying various approaches to deeply learning complex behaviors, as well as the computational principles and neural mechanisms that underlie such learning. These approaches have advanced to the point that, in some cases, general rules can be inferred in both the computational and neural basis of the behavior. These rules are consistent with the human brain’s behavior in particular domains, and in many cases with the robotic nature of the behavior. We thus provide a"

Theoretically, it’s not hard to imagine how the law of the instrument can help us see what’s really going on behind the numbers of cases and the numbers of deaths, but it’s a lot harder to implement. To understand why, consider the following statistics:
- The Covid-19 pandemic has killed more than 1,000 Americans, or about 0.05% of our population.

T. brucei displays a variety of lifestyles depending on the ecological niche. In the wild vector phase, it lives in the blood and salivary glands of tsetse flies, whereas in the human phase (or sleeping sickness) it invades the human nervous system. The molecular genetic analysis of the African trypanosomes and the parallel reduction of their genomes have revealed that they are probably the most evolutionarily conserved eukaryotic genome in nature. We hypothesize that the conservation of the genome and the genetic organization of their mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) indicates the emergence of a highly conserved parasitic lifestyle in the face of the selective pressure of the human immune system. We thus examined the phylogenetic origin of the African trypanosomes and the mechanism of their adaptation to infect humans, and we show that this highly conserved parasitic lifestyle is shared with other Neotropical trypanosomes"

A simple model has recently been developed to understand the fundamental physics of the far field, by a machine-learning approach based on an ensemble of canonical quantized states. The nonlinear wavefunctions are expected to exhibit the wave-particle duality of the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED), which is a fundamental part of the Standard Model. Quantized states are cyclotron-related, the angular part of the Einsteins’ cyclotron resonance, and the renormalized wavefunctions are the canonical ensemble of the semiclassical limit. The study of the dynamics of the wavefuncitons is expected to be a fruitful path to understand the dynamics of the spin–orbit interaction, which is a key ingredient of the Standard Model. We have demonstrated the possibility to reliably compute the evolution of the wavefunction of the system, to understand the origin of the nonperturbative spin–orbit interaction, and to simulate the spontaneous coupling of the spin–orbit interaction with a quantum mechanical picture of the interaction, which is a significant step further in our understanding of the physics of the far field.

(Middle school level summarization) In the past, there were outbreaks of a deadly disease called the Black Death in Europe. Scientists have been trying to figure out how this disease spread, and one theory is that it was transmitted by human ectoparasites like fleas and lice.

We also show that the brain size–neuron ratio is an important factor in explaining the neural basis of human-specific abilities to self-reflect and feel empathy.

This suggests that, in the absence of face-to-face interaction, people can experience and transmit emotions to others. By analyzing changes in the emotional content of people’s Facebook profiles, we were able to predict their daily happiness level, as well as their tendency to self-report happiness, with a significant amount of improvement compared to random guess.

whole body vibration, can't live with it, can't live without it.
Who knew that whole body vibration (WAV) could be implicated in reducing the risk of falling? As the trial data have been published, it seems that the evidence is getting stronger.
The trial showed that a 3-min daily WAV intervention at 60 Hz to 1,300 g, in addition to a standard care program, reduced the risk of falls by 28% compared to standard care alone. The reasons are not yet clear, but one of the proposed mechanisms, which is still in the testing stage, is the effect on postural control.

Our analyses of the fossil record indicate that extant aquatic mammals are evolving toward larger body sizes than their terrestrial relatives. Such a pattern is consistent with an energetic model in which the relative energetic burden of thermoregulation and feeding is lower in aquatic than in terrestrial environments. We also find that the body size of extant aquatic mammals is approaching an attractor that encompasses the maximum size of their terrestrial relatives, thus indicating that the energetic constraints of the aquatic medium may be driving the evolution of large body sizes in marine mammals.

We examined virus replication kinetics, transcriptional and proteomic responses to infection, and virus-induced phenotypes of infected cells. We found that rhinovirus replication was faster in mouse airway cells at 37 °C relative to 33 °C, and this effect was driven, in part, by selective induction of a protective antiviral response. We further found that viruses replicating preferentially at 37 °C in vitro were more pathogenic in vivo than those replicating preferentially at 33 °C.

Indeed, the oxygen-sensing function of haemoglobin was discovered by the British physiologist Norman Haworth in 1908, and the oxygen-sensing properties of the oxygen-sensitive hemoglobin-associated catecholaminergic transmitter ß-carbomethoxytyramine (β-CMT), with which our studies are directly related, were first described in 1967. The most recent finding of the hemoglobin-binding catecholamine β-CMT by our group was published in 2015. However, the molecular mechanism by which hemoglobin senses oxygen, or why it, rather than other oxygen-sensitive hemoproteins, has this particular sensitivity, has remained a mystery. In this talk I shall present a recent study that hints at a molecular basis for this mystery.

Sven: There are many interesting ethical and political issues surrounding the domestication of animals. The chicken is a model species for the domestication of birds, but also for other animals. I am going to present the results of my research on the domestication of chickens, which was recently published (Koestler, S., Kanold, K., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 2020, v. 117, p. 6,543–58). In particular, we have been looking at the genetic and archaeological evidence for the domestication of chickens. We found a major genetic discontinuity between the ancient domesticated strains and the non-domesticated wild relatives. This genetic evidence, together with archaeological data, indicate that the domestication of chickens was a very concentrated event in a small area. The"

The complete paper:
Proton-rich metabolites, such as the ketosynthase-like protein-rich (KLPR) class of proteins, are among the most abundant fractions of the RNA world. Existing theories of the origin of life focus on the importance of the ability of RNA to fold into functional forms. However, the origin of life is unclear due to the fact that there is no simple theory for the selection of the simplest self-associating RNAs. We propose a nonamino acid-based model of self-association of RNAs that relies on protonation and deprotonation of the molecule, which we call the “photon-proton-catalyzed peptide bond” model. This model allows RNA to self-fold into not just"

The rate at which such transport is performed is the most sensitive parameter that determines the efficiency of the action of this enzyme. The thermodynamic free energy of the enzyme-substrate complex is an important determinant of its activity; however, the dynamics of the reaction’s transition state and the conformational changes in the enzyme may also affect its efficiency. To determine these parameters, we developed a quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) model with a series of MtaT4-containing proteins, which revealed that the kinetics of the reaction depends on the relative stability of its transition state. The model also showed that the efficiency of the enzyme was highly dependent on the conformational dynamics of the active site during the catalysis, thus providing the basis for the rational design of a more efficient version of the enzyme.

Robots are being used in a wide variety of fields, including healthcare (e.g., robotic surgery) and renewable energy (e.g., autonomous inspection of wind turbines). While these applications are highly successful, they are not without their challenges. For example, robotic surgery is only possible because the surgeon has extensive knowledge of the human body. Applying this knowledge to a robot requires the surgeon to program and train the robot on the fly, often during surgery. This is time consuming and sometimes impossible, so surgeons have to rely on existing knowledge to guide"

During copulation, sperm are rapidly transferred from males to females, and during storage in the female reproductive tract, sperm from males associate with the female, allowing a transition from the male to the female side. Here we show that the transfer of sperm to the female doesn’t simply impose a single protein profile on the female reproductive tract. Sperm acquire a unique subset of proteins that provide fuel for sperm viability, and these proteins are enriched in females and depleted in males.
The allowed epsilon-convergence limit for establishment and maintenance of a postcopulatory sexual identity is far less than the number of proteins identified. We used multiplexed mass spectrometers to measure the postcopulatory life history of the Drosophila melanogaster sperm proteome, and show that the postcopulatory sex-biased remodeling of the sperm proteome spans the entire spectrum of asexual reproduction. This process involves a shift of the male-biased proteins to the female, and a corresponding expansion of female-biased proteins in the male. Our results"

Background: The steady-state distribution of normal and cancer cells differs by the number of somatic (e.g., TP53) or germline (e.g., BRCA1/2) mutations, and the cell proliferation characteristics of an individual cell population. This disparity in mutation rate and cell proliferation dynamics provides a potential rationale for the notion that the genetic basis for malignancy is mutagenic stress. However, it is not yet clear whether the cell-cycle machinery that governs mitosis is itself regulated by mutagenic stress. Here we show that the mutator phenotype is accompanied by a dramatic increase in the genome-wide activity of the topological regulator APC. We demonstrate that this signature correlates with the frequency of accumulated mutations and is a consequence of the mutator phenotype, not a consequence of the mutator gene itself.
Mechanism: We identified the human APC kinase, centrin, as the mutator gene. APC mutations are strongly associated with increased cancer risk, including the higher-risk BRCA1/2 mutation."

Here, we analyze the thermostability of ancestral (extant-type) enzymes to derive minimum ambient environmental temperatures at the time of evolutionary divergence. The inferred temperatures, based on constrained thermodynamic properties of the ancestral enzymes, imply a stable, but rapidly cooling, ocean environment during the Archean. This interpretation is consistent with the isotopic record of the geological sedimentary record and the isotopic composition of phototropic organisms.
The physical experiments are done with a light-stimulated phototrophic thermophilic cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus, but the mathematical model of enzyme physics is broadly applicable to other phototrophic phototrophs, including cyanobacteria and eukaryotes.

Family history of cancer, smoking, alcohol consumption, and many other risk factors have been well characterised for decades. However, there is a growing appreciation that variations in environmental factors, such as humidity, may also contribute to disease susceptibility, severity, and outcome. The impact of humidity on in vitro and in vivo infection and disease can be substantial. In particular, relative humidity (RH) affects most aspects of the immune system, from innate and adaptive immunity to antiviral defense, innate antimicrobial defense, and tissue repair. The central hypothesis is that the impact of relative humidity on disease may be as important as that of genetic factors.
We begin by explaining the significance of humidity in viral pathogenesis. We then briefly introduce the various ways in which humidity influences the course of viral infection and disease. We then describe some of the mechanisms by which humidity affects host immunity, and lastly, we show how humidity influences disease outcome, and discuss the mechanistic underpinnings of these effects. We explain how this emerging science can inspire a more complete understanding of disease causation and contribute to the identification of new therapeutic targets.

The islet-inducing factor, a key transcription factor that is essential for the differentiation of pancreatic islet-like cells in mice, is in the same family of genes as two proteins that are specific to the development of skeletal muscle. The study of the analogous islets in the autotendency of the pancreatome will show that the human form of the islet-inducing factor, which is essential for the formation of the pancreatic islet, is located within the most recent common ancestor of the Homo sapiens, whereas the skeletal muscle-specific form was lost in that lineage. Thus, the human pancreatome is a remnant of an ancestral counterpart. We hypothesize that this gene has lost its islet-penetrating function but has retained a role in developing or maintaining skeletal muscle. The study of the functional role of the islet-inducing factor is thus a bridge between the biology of developing pancreas and the biology of developing skeletal muscle.
The study of the islet-inducing factor will demonstrate that the islet-penetrating function is a homology to the insect-penetrating function."

Here, we show that stimulation of the LH, whether by optogenetic or electrical means, induces eating. Lesion of VTA GABA neurons blunts LH stimulation-induced feeding. We demonstrate that LH GABA neurons project to the caudal locus coeruleus (LC) and that this projection is necessary for stimulation-induced eating. Interestingly, lesions of the peri-LC GABA neurons have no effect on eating. These findings suggest that the caudal LC has a direct role in eating, perhaps through the suppression of VTA GABA neurons. The present study establishes a critical role for the caudal LC in the hunger-driven eating of animals.

By utilizing signal transduction pathways that are conserved from bacteria to higher eukaryotes, plants have evolved an integrated system to sense their environment, sense their symbionts and deliver signals to the symbionts, and to regulate their gene expression, metabolite synthesis and metabolism in response to the nitrogen supply from their symbionts. This control system has been shown to harbor both positive and negative feedback loops, where a change in the supply of a specific metabolite, and thus also the plant’s photosynthetic capacity or nitrogen fixation, can change the local environment and, in turn, the plant’s perception of its symbionts. This results in a feedback loop controlling both the availability of carbon and nitrogen to the plant and the growth of the symbiont community, which is also likely to be a key component of the biodiversity of the soil microbiome.

The human-nature relationship is therefore becoming more and more important for society’s well being. Current approaches and policies for mitigating such impacts are often ineffective; this is because they tend to rely on top-down, top-down control (e.g., laws, development aid, policing), while the main drivers of deforestation (e.g., poverty, population growth, and land tenure) are societal problems that require bottom-up, bottom-up solutions. Thus, in this talk we will present one such bottom-up, bottom-up solution, the model of the Forest Patrols without Borders (FPwB) initiative. FPwB is a multi-stakeholder alliance of indigenous peoples, local communities, and movement leaders working to protect forests against illegal deforestation through a bottom-up, bottom-up approach to forest management.

Across seven studies using a nationally representative sample, we found that men’s endorsement of this form of masculinity predicted their support for Trump, compared to non-hegemonic forms of masculinity, as well as women’s and men’s support for other candidates, including Biden. Importantly, these effects were driven by men’s endorsement of the “warrior” aspect of masculinity, which is associated with support for Trump and other masculine leaders reminiscent of Donald Trump, but not the “hero” aspect of masculinity, which is associated with women’s support for Hillary Clinton.

Agricultural intensification with tillage and fertilization has resulted in persistent organic carbon (C) loss to the atmosphere, which is now recognized as a main driver of global climate change. We investigated the ecological and economic potential of sustainable agriculture to sequester organic C (i.e., Mollisols) in grassland-based cropping systems integrated with livestock production for the growing human population. In our study, we found that rotational grazing and interseeded legumes in combination with diverse crop rotations, cover crops, and cover-crop residues can sequester C and other ecosystem services as the foundation of climate-smart agriculture. These ecological intensification strategies hold promise for mitigating climate change, adapting to its impacts, and addressing the challenge of feeding the world’s growing population.

By sequencing the DNA of a single-stranded circular cDNA library, we found that the gene was mutated in a subset of E. coli isolates, which had a high frequency of resistance to the bactericidal activity of botulinum toxin. This mutation was caused by the insertion of a cytosine-uracil base pair into the promoter region, which disrupted the codon usage bias and repressed the expression of the gene. The toxin-resistant mutants, unlike their wild-type counterparts, do not have a constitutively active TcdA toxin-synthesizing enzyme, leading to survival in the presence of lethal amounts of the toxin. This observation demonstrates that the antibiotic resistance-associated mutations are potentially lethal. The analysis of such transgressive mutations in a clinically relevant pathogen has never been done before.

(1) The origin of life is the most important unsolved problem in science. The RNA world hypothesis is the only serious scientific theory that can explain how the first living systems emerged on the planet. It is compatible with the best available evidence and is supported by a large quantity of specific predictions about the processes of origin of life. In addition, during the last ten to twenty years, a number of experimental results have confirmed the RNA world hypothesis and, most importantly, have made it possible to experimentally test many of its predictions. Thus, RNA world and the challenge of its testing are the central theme of our talk.
(2) The discrepancy between the RNA world hypothesis and the chemistry of the laboratory is due to the fact that theoretical predictions of the RNA world have not yet been verified by experiments. The reason is that the physical structure of the RNA world is very complex and very difficult to construct. It is necessary to design and make molecules that are able to store information, to amplify it exponentially, and to catalyze chemical reactions. It is also necessary"

We hypothesize that the future of cities will be the gradual process of urban collapse, driven by a series of ratcheting catastrophes tied to the physical environment. We argue that the “death spiral”"

The xan cluster is a two-component biosynthetic system that encodes the xanthonines, xanthotecan, xanthotoxin, and xanthin, which are the different isomers of the xanotoxin precursor. The xanotoxins are isocyanides that are secreted by A. fumigatus and bind copper from the environment and from the fungal intracellular pool, which is essential for the homeostasis of the metal and for the ability to suppress human pathogens. The xanotoxin is an antimicrobial agent that is specific for growth of human pathogens, but is not toxic to humans. The fungal biosynthetic pathway involves the C. elegans"

The high-pressure hydrothermal system is thought to have been a geothermal system, powered by the heat of radioactive decay, in a “Lake Gale” catchment environment. Detrital phases are interpreted to be formed by a combination of volcanic outflow, impact-generated mass ejection, and diagenetic alteration.

The Rise and Fall of the Isotopically-Defined Human
The isotopic composition of carbon and nitrogen in humans is a direct reflection of their dietary consumption. The rise of agriculture, coupled with the evolution of cooking and fermentation, has enabled the Archaeo- and Paleolithic human ancestors to consume increasingly large amounts of animal protein and fat, thereby increasing the carbon and nitrogen isotopic fractionation. This increase in isotopic fractionation is reflected in the isotopic composition of our fossilized remains. However, the relationship between these isotopic compositions and the underlying dietary physiology remains poorly understood. Here, we show that 1) human isotopic fractionation signals are detectable in the earliest known fossils in the archaeological"

Simplified version: The many roles of Th17 cells in inflammatory bowel disease and beyond.
TRAIL-resistant myeloid-activated cell engagement (TRAIL-MEAC) has a long history as an effective therapy for cancer. However, it is only recently that TRAIL-MEAC has emerged as a potential therapy for autoimmune disease. The recruitment of innate immune cells (usually macrophages) to inflamed tissues is essential for the development of protective immune responses to infection or injury. However, it is also known that macrophages recruited to inflammatory sites can cause tissue damage and fibrosis, and that this is mediated by proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-17 and TNF-α. Nevertheless, macrophage recruitment alone does not fully explain the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In contrast to IBD, cancer is characterized by a reciprocal relationship between immune cells and tumors. Tumors are believed to be immunogenic, and the immune system is believed to play a role in their development, progression, and treatment. In this regard, T cells are central for antitumor responses.

These astrocytes produce more misfolded protein and cause toxicity to motor neurons. By understanding the mechanism, we hope to eventually develop a therapy for ALS.

Collateral damage: the ecological impact of warfare on the ocean environment
The advent of nuclear weapons caused a paradigm shift in the study of warfare. In addition to the killing power of nuclear weapons, the environmental effects, ranging from the global cooling effect of the nuclear winter to the indiscriminate destruction of marine environments, were realized. The devastating chemical warfare agents, including nerve gas and defoliant, were likewise discovered to have a devastating effect on the environment. In the aftermath of the nuclear tests in the Pacific, the evolution of the marine phytoplankton was observed to be in an “unnatural” state, whereby species richness and abundance were altered. The anthropogenic perturbation from the nuclear weapons testing had a transformative effect on marine ecosystems. The nuclear tests helped to demonstrate that the ocean is a dynamic ecosystem, not only responding to the natural variation of climate, but also responding to human-caused perturbations"

The presence of a fused scapulocoracoid is a plumage-related innovation that appears to have independently evolved, at least in part, to provide the basal avian lineage with more efficient flight performance. Because this feature was shared by basal pygostylians with Confuciusornithiformes, it is likely that this taxon experienced a mosaic pattern of morphological development in the proximal skeleton, with the scapulocoracoid being derived from the fused scapular and coracoid regions of the nonavian theropod ancestor.

By altering fire regimes, each can amplify or mitigate the other, potentially with far-reaching global consequences. This paper investigates the extent to which changes in the global fire regime driven by climate change are a self-reinforcing feedback loop. We find that human-driven climate policy may stabilize the climate–forest relationship. Reducing emissions can more than offset climate change by reducing fire activity and increasing carbon uptake by the biosphere.

Preliminary version: Our research reveals a complex, coupled Earth system governing the global fire regime. We find that the two sides of the climate–fire relationship are self-reinforcing and nonlinear. Human climate policy, especially reductions in fossil fuel emissions, can alter the stability of the climate–fire regime and preserve a stable climate. In contrast, climate change could amplify fire over the 21st century. If unchecked, fire regimes could transition to a regime dominated by extensive, high-severity fires. This would have profound effects on climate, carbon cycling, and the global biosphere.

I was surprised to find this paper. It’s fascinating to see that the environment can influence the activity and persistence of symbiotic organisms. We’ve known for a long time that the environment can influence the behavior of animals, and here we see a direct role for the environment in the behavior of symbiotic bacteria.
One of the most striking findings of this paper is that the timing of chitin catabolism by the squid’s host is tightly regulated by the environment. The chitin was synthesized by hemocytes in the host’s vasculature, and was only released at night, when the hemocytes migrated into the crypts of the squid’s symbiotic organ. This timing is consistent with the circadian rhythm in the squid’s hemocyte production. So, it appears that the squid evolved a way to provide its symbiont with the resources it needs when the symbiont is most active.

You probably have heard about the sexiest word of the decade: “verify”.
Verify.
“The word is sexy because it conveys a notion of closure,” says one observer. In addition to being the most popular word in the verb category—third only to “scam”—verify has become a verb that captures the attention of the press.

This phenomenon is readily explained in the light of the energy budget of the Tropical Ocean and the land-atmosphere system.
“The concept of plague is a new one and still needs to be developed further,” says Prof. Richard [Gallant]. “But it is a central and fundamental part of the history of humanity and the planet, and we need to understand it. The current pandemic is viewed as a ‘natural experiment’ that shows clearly how our modern lifestyle and culture have created an unprecedented, globally sustainable environment for the transmission of microbial pathogens, and that this is why it has not become a global epidemic. But we should not just consider the pandemic as an isolated case of an ongoing plague, but rather as a harbinger of a new phase in our history. The pandemic is more than an important historical event. It is a signal of a changing climate regime.”"

We hypothesize that a previously unknown virus, similar to the one that has been associated with the recent mass mortality of California sea stars, is responsible for the mass mortality. Isolates of such a virus could be detected in the tissues of deceased echinoderms or in situ, and we will establish the molecular epidemiology of the virus using the same sequence-based methods that led to the discovery of the virus responsible for the sea star wasting syndrome.
The global decline in vertebrate populations has been well documented, but invertebrates have been largely ignored. Here we report that global declines in foraminifera are occurring at an accelerating rate. This decline is not only a consequence of the ongoing human-caused threat of habitat destruction, but also of the ubiquity of viral disease agents, such as those associated with chytrid fungi, rhabdoviruses, and retroviruses. The combined effects of habitat destruction and viral disease will likely have a significant impact on the future global carbon cycle.

In the laboratory, the anti-IL1RAP antibody can be used as part of immunotherapy for AML, and it can also be used to study the mechanisms of action of the targeted therapy.
Lentiviral-based gene therapy is emerging as an important therapeutic modality for the treatment of cancer, and one of the most relevant and pressing challenges is to develop safe and effective gene delivery vectors. Because of its excellent long-term stability, high efficacy, and biocompatibility, lentiviral vectors have been widely used in gene therapy.

On the other hand, the analysis of the mtDNA from the ‘original’ Malagasy people revealed that the most recent common ancestor of all Malagasy alive today was not the first toad-at-large, but one of their ancestors who lived perhaps ca. 12,000 y ago. We also reconstructed the ancestral sequences of the yam lineage which has been the staple food of the Malagasy people for at least 7,000 y ago. These results imply that the original Malagasy did not originate in Africa and that the yam lineage has been domesticated in Madagascar for at least 7,000 y.

We combine large-scale survey data from the American Time Use survey with an original online survey with over 12,000 participants and find that people who worked from home for at least some time during the pandemic felt more isolated than people who did not work from home. The effect was especially pronounced for people who worked from home most of the time, but we also find that working from home had a similar negative effect on sense of community to living alone. We use a nationally representative sample to investigate whether the effect is driven by a reduced number of in-person social interactions, and find that the effect on sense of community is not driven by a reduced number of in-person social interactions, but rather a reduced number of social activities. Finally, we investigate whether some individuals are more vulnerable than others to the negative effects of working from home and find that the effect is largely driven by women, people under age 50, and those"

This account is based on the idea of the existence of a dynamic memory system that manipulates information in its own right. Unlike classic accounts of memory, this system is not dependant on synaptic plasticity or persistent activity. Instead, it is appropriate for the processing of complex, abstract entities that are cognitively meaningful. In the absence of conscious awareness, this system can create memories in a single trial with a single pulse of activity. The talk will begin by describing how this system operates in the brain machines that control movement. It will then be shown how it relates to the neural basis of language, which can be comprehended as a set of rules for encoding information. Finally, we will discuss the implications of this idea for the interpretation of existing neuroimaging and behaviour data.

We present global, long-term observations spanning six ecosystem types, 27,000 soil respiration measurements, and over 20 years of warming to determine the response of soil respiration to warming. We find no significant warming-induced changes in soil respiration rates in the vast majority of ecosystems, except for the boreal forest, where we find significant increases in respiration rate with warming. We use these observations of no warming-induced changes to infer that, on average, the global carbon sink will be largely insensitive to climate change. However, we find significant temperature dependence of soil respiration in ecosystems, with lower-latitude regions being far more responsive to warming. These temperature-dependent responses are consistent with the idea that soil carbon stores in the tropics and subtropics are more vulnerable to warming than in higher latitudes—an idea we term the “tropic-nontropic gradient of vulnerability.” We find that warming will increase the vulnerability of tropic regions and result in net carbon emissions under future warming, even though the combined warming and rainfall response of the global carbon"

However, the development of new anticancer therapies is still very slow, and the side effects of these therapies are rather common. We have shown that inhibition of apoptosis in cancer cells results in the activation of protein kinase R (PKR), leading to the activation of the AMPK signaling pathway.

In the Anthropocene, human population is both causing and reacting to a myriad of ecosystem changes. This paper uses paleoclimatology and paleobiology to analyze how the Anthropocene has influenced drought since the mid-19th century. We find that the history of California’s current drought is a case study in how climate variability has been exacerbated by anthropogenic forcing, and we identify the existence of a strong human fingerprint on the modern-day drought. This knowledge is used to forecast how the Anthropocene will further exacerbate drought in California. We find that if we continue on the current trajectory, then the probability of consecutive dry and warm years in California will increase.

The cytoplasmic domain of this channel affects its function in several ways. In this talk, we will focus on the molecular mechanism by which the cytoplasmic domain regulates the Ca2+-activated Ca2+-transporting (CRAC) channel. We show that a single amino acid change in the cytoplasmic domain of the channel modulates its activity in response to Ca2+. We further demonstrate how the cytoplasmic domain interacts with the channel’s receptor kinases, which control the function of the channel, and how this interaction is disrupted by the presence of a specific inhibitor of the receptor kinases. These studies reveal a fundamental mechanism by which the cytoplasmic domain of the CRAC channel regulates its function. The findings also suggest a mechanism by which the channel is gated, and suggest the possibility of pharmacological modulation of the g"

We have witnessed this in our own lives, from the time we were born, and it also underlies the complex and remarkable biology of homeostasis, including the many mechanisms that allow the brain to regulate and adapt to changing circumstances. We will explore an unusual connection between the spread of protein aggregates, a key pathological mechanism in neurodegenerative diseases, and this remarkable biology of sensing and adapting.
Let’s look at an example: there are many neurodegenerative diseases that are caused by the buildup of aggregated proteins, such as mutant huntingtin or tau in Alzheimer’s disease or alpha-synuclein in Parkinson’s disease. We know that these proteins can be toxic to neurons, and cause degeneration of neurons or even cell death. However, we don’t yet understand how to stop them from spreading to other neurons in the brain, and this is a major barrier to developing effective therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.
It turns out that the brain has many mechanisms to stop the spread of harmful proteins in the brain. For example, if you look at neurons that"

The Sca-totheno-retinoic acid (STaR) pathway is a major metabolic pathway that is central to the formation of the abundant lipid bilayer of the myelin sheath covering the axons of the central nervous system. The STaR pathway consists of a sequence of enzymes and is regulated by both transcription and posttranscriptional regulation via poly(A) tail modification and protein acetylation. The acetylation of proteins by the enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase-acetyltransferase (ACC)-9 (ATCT) is necessary for the proper function of the enzyme. The acetylation is facilitated by the transcriptional regulator, myelin-associated protein 2 (MAP2), which has been shown to undergo acetylation by ATCT-9. This shows that the acetylation by the STaR pathway is important for migratory and target cell adhesion and myelin formation. We have uncovered a previously unknown disease-associated mutation in the regulatory region of the STaR pathway, which caused"

The function of a small set of these proteins, the human cytoskeletal microtubule-associated proteins Tafetinib, p16, and p53, is to control mitotic arrest to prevent cancer development. We have set out to investigate the function of another small set of proteins, the histone deacetylase inhibitors, that are capable of inhibiting cellular proliferation by a process that is different from chromosome-level DNA damage response. These inhibitors are generally able to suppress proliferation in many cancer cell lines where the up-regulation of the p16 or p53 tumor suppressor genes is correlated with poor prognosis. However, it remains to be seen whether these inhibitors are able to target the same set of proteins as Tafetinib, p16, and p53.

We have observed that the same processes are operating in the inclusions of a variety of animal and human neurodegenerative diseases, including the FTD-ALS spectrum of disease. We begin by showing that the molecular basis of the disease is the collapse of protein homeostasis, particularly within the motor neurons. We then show that the molecular basis of the inclusions is the collapse of protein homeostasis, and that the inclusions are a consequence of the collapse of the molecular basis of the disease. We also show that the presence of polymerization of the inclusions may well be highly selective for a specific set of properties or functions of motor neurons, and that this selective collapse of protein homeostasis would not be expected to occur in other types of cells. We end with a discussion of the consequences of this analysis for the design of therapeutics for these types of diseases.

The limiting cycle time is the critical issue, because the not-so-lightest atoms in the middle of the electron gas are about twice as fast as the mean free path of the light. The laser frequency is about 1.56-times the speed of light, so the photons travel about 1/3 of a wavelength ahead of the electron mean speed. This velocity is not enough to accelerate the electrons to the speed of light, which is faster than the moving target or the electron gas, but it is enough to allow them to get close enough that they can interact with the atoms in the middle of the sample. The photo-physical problem is that the electrons do not know where they are, and if the electrons are in the “wrong” place, they can be trapped by the atom–electron interaction. The best way to place the electrons is to tune the frequency to the resonant frequency of the atom. This means that the"

In the present study, we present a novel analysis of the fossil record of the earliest angiosperms showing that the oldest known angiosperm leaves, belonging to the genus Montsechia, were gigantic and had a distinctive morphological patterning of leaflets. We show that Montsechia is sister to all other known Mesozoic angiosperms and suggest that its early diversification and success in the Triassic was driven by its adaptation to the aquatic habitat. In particular, the presence of multiple leaves per stem and a floating leaflet formation, which is unique in the Late Triassic, is considered to be a key adaptation to the aquatic lifestyle. The Neotethys Ocean was an ideal habitat for the diversification of the angiosperm lineage, but its full potential was only realized in the Mesozoic.

We find that B19 evolved from a common ancestor that was ∼12.6 thousand years old. The divergence between the ancestral and the first-argyrounth genome was ∼10.8 thousand years, and the rate of evolution was ∼4x lesser than inferred previously. The timing of the first occurrence of the virus in humans is constrained to before the domestication of dogs and the advent of agriculture, and its association with the earliest human populations is consistent with the hypothesis that the disease was involved in the evolution of human population genetics.

This is a very similar finding to the current trend of increasing inactivity, sedentary life, and obesity, which are all inter-related harms of a changed lifestyle. The trend of increasing pain parallels the trend in a wider range of physical and mental health measures—and the only explanation is societal changes.

Vibrio fischeri, the symbiotic bacterium that provides light to a number of species, including the tanicat face (V. fischeri-bearing squids), is a model for the functional integration of molecular biology, physiology, and ecology. To study the environmental factors that control the physiology of the symbiontic interaction, we combined transcriptomic profiling and co-culturing of the host and its symbiont. We show that the host-derived chitin is the key nutrient that controls the symbiotic physiology. In addition, the chitin catabolism is part of a complex host-symbiont regulatory cycle that includes a periodic acidification of the symbiotic tissue. This acidification has a strong impact on the symbiotic light production. We propose that the availability of carbon-bearing nutrients may be a major factor that controls the biological organization of the microbial symbiosis. Our findings demonstrate that seemingly simple biological processes are, in fact, organized by the dynamics of the environment and the selective pressure of the host.

Psychologists should care about edutainment
By the time you read this, a few years may have passed, and the social distancing orders may have been replaced by “freedom convicts.” The urgent need to keep the pandemic at bay may have faded. And the emotional trauma of the pandemic may have abated. The recent presidential election may have produced rifts between folks with different political leanings, as well as a polarized nation. The liberal and conservative parties may have continued to exist but faltered, or perhaps even collapsed. In the midst of it all, psychology may help the nation move on.
The pandemic, the election, and other traumas of our time have combined to produce a shared, national trauma. As psychological research has shown, trauma is often compounded by fragmentation.

It encodes the genetic information that provides the instructions for building and maintaining an organism. Its triple-stranded helical structure is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the adjacent base pairs. The integrity of this structure is of critical importance for the accuracy of DNA replication and transcription. However, the stability of DNA is jeopardized by the presence of structural lesions. These structural lesions may be caused by a variety of factors, including endogenous endogenous and exogenous chemical agents. Our work investigated the impact of DNA alkylation on the efficiency and accuracy of transcription. The transcriptional stalling profiles of the three structural lesions of DNA were systematically studied in vitro. Interestingly, we found distinct stalling patterns for the three structural lesions. These findings are consistent with the mechanistic insights derived from the DNA repair pathways. Moreover, the transcriptional stalling profiles were well correlated with the mutagenesis analysis. Finally, the structural lesion bypass routes were identified. Our work provided mechanistic insights on how a variety of DNA structural lesions impact DNA transcription and how the efficiency of DNA repair processes varies with the DNA lesion type.

To determine how proteases affect this process, we mutated a single residue in the S protein of MERS-CoV to hinder the first cleavage, but left the cleavages intact. This strategy revealed that this mutation attenuated cell entry, whereas mutations affecting the second cleavages increased cell entry. We conclude that the first cleavage is the most important for MERS-CoV-to-mitochondrial fusion, and that proteases are important to facilitate this fusion. MERS-CoV may enter cells and replicate by a two-step process involving the first cleavage and the subsequent fusion with the endosomal membrane. We found that a protease in human lungs, which cleaves the S1 protein of MERS-CoV, is also required for cell entry. This suggests that proteases may have a determinant role in infecting and replicating to human cells.

Stimulating these oncogenes causes substantial remodeling of the cell surface proteome, which we can now decipher using a combination of small-scale proteomics and full-genome expression. Our mechanistic work identifies the types of surfaces oncogenes remodel, including nutrient transporters, adhesive molecules, signal transduction partners, and immune modulators, and reveals that the same oncogenes cause similar changes in the surfaceome. We also found that these types of surface remodeling were amplified in the tumorigenic region of the cell, and that they were systematically weakened in the absence of the oncogene. We show that modulation of the surfaceome is a common thread in the proliferation and metastasis of many types of cancers. Finally, we show that the surfaceome can be used as a biomarker for distinguishing cancer from benign lesions and as a guide to the discovery of therapeutic targets.

When we focus on the remaining 30% of the vote, and the only event that would have had any detectable effect on the election outcome, we find no detectable effect of vbm on vote share"

We also demonstrate that these cells improve blood flow recovery in a hind limb ischemic model.
The story so far: In the past decade, the understanding of how endothelial cells are generated has progressed significantly, and we now know that it is possible to generate endothelial cells from fibroblasts and other cells. The next step is to understand how to direct the generated endothelial cells toward a desired function, such as the regeneration of the vascular system. In this study, we demonstrate that endothelial regeneration is possible, but we also show that the extent of success will be driven by the complexity of the ischemic lesion and the efficiency of the regeneration process.

The aim of this study is to understand the molecular basis of disturbed flow-induced proliferation and inflammation in the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels.

We estimate that people have caused more than twice as many fires in the United States as lightning strikes, and that anthropogenic fires are expanding the geographic and seasonal fire niche more rapidly than lightning-started fires. Awareness of the growing role of human-caused wildfire risk is essential for wildfire management and policy, but the extent of this increased human-caused wildfire risk is not well understood.

Based on a subsample of more than 1.5 million images, we find that high-quality neighborhoods (e.g., “rich and cosmopolitan”) are associated with higher average household incomes, especially for families with children. Furthermore, we find that this association is largely determined by the physical appearance of neighborhoods, which is unrelated to their racial demographics.

The number of species is estimated to be more than 10 quintillion. The number of genes has been estimated at three to six billion. If every possible combination of traits contributes only one more thing to this number, then the number of genes and species on Earth is no more than a quadrillion. Consequently, the interaction between genes and species is highly complex and probably involves the wildcat-like combination of interacting and confounding factors, such as the isotope effect. The study of the impact of isotope effect on gene or species evolution touches upon various disciplines of science, including multidisciplinary fields of chemistry, biology, and ecology.
Now the three disciplines of science can join forces to understand the influence of isotope effect on the evolution of the living world. As a case in point, we propose to study the effect of isotope on the evolution of arthropods. Arthropods have played a very significant role in the history of life on Earth. They serve as the primary link between evolutionary biology and the history of chemistry. While nearly half of all species are insects, the origin of insects, the mid-"

The yearly number of births affected by Zika virus is highly correlated with the mean global temperature anomaly, and the average number of birth defects caused by Zika virus is the highest in the region of the world that is experiencing the strongest warming (in this case, the Amazon Basin), where the number of births affected by Zika virus has more than quadrupled since 2010.

We found that JNK signaling is the driver of intestinal carcinogenesis. We found a feedback loop between intestinal cancer, JNK signaling, and the microbiome. JNK signaling is a transcription factor that regulates various physiological mechanisms, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, survival, and differentiation. The activity of JNK is required for the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis: it establishes a balance between proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of intestinal epithelium. Dysregulation of JNK signaling, however, leads to aberrant activation of oncogenes, aberrant intestinal epithelial proliferation, and the occurrence of intestinal carcinogenesis. Here, we report that inhibiting JNK signaling in a Drosophila model reverses tumorigenesis and microbiome-driven dysbiosis, which, in turn, restores host–microbe homeostasis. We speculate that a similar mechanism is likely to be at work in the human gut.

We show that both forms of outgrowth are under genetic control, and that the same genes and mechanisms regulate both. We identify a novel paradigm underlying the regeneration of the CNS, which relies on the regulation of growth rates and/or directional guidance. This paradigm has been known for a long time, but the genetic causes have eluded researchers.

This is because, as with most of biology, selection operates on the most fundamental unit of evolutionary development, the genome. The implications of this have not been fully appreciated, and the mathematical tools to investigate it in detail are in their infancy. Using a combination of experimental evolution, comparative genomics, and next-generation sequencing, we have demonstrated that selection may not only act on gene-level phenotypes, but also on the nascent genome, producing characteristic, underlying patterns of its evolution. This process, termed genome-level selection, is central to the origination of animal phenotypes.

The results of our study are consistent with the idea that epigenetic memory can be inherited rather than acquired during the course of the disease. These epigenetic effects may contribute to the loss of benefits accrued from intensive therapy. This hypothesis fits with the current concept of metabolic memory, which explains the failure of intensive glycemic control to prevent the evolving complications of diabetes.
The finding that DNA-me differences associated with diabetes persist over time in blood monocytes suggests that these epigenetic effects may be not only inherited but also transmitted to offspring.

This may disrupt the balance of the gut microbiota, which, in turn, may lead to the development of alcohol craving and/or anxiety. We also found that administering an antibiotic can render the gut permeable, which can exacerbate the symptoms of alcohol dependence.

Recently, we discovered that the brain’s grid cells in the MEC are not merely the lowest-level object detectors, but are, in fact, major contributors to the visual system’s command to act on objects in the world, which is common even in animals that do not consciously consider their actions. We also discovered that these object-selective cells are organized as a hierarchy of functionally connected modules, each of which is responsible for activation of a different set of higher-level behavioral tendencies. We found, for example, that grid cells are most selective for objects that move in the right direction, while they are less selective for objects that move in either direction. We also found that a small subset of grid cells serves as a master “think tank” that decides on the appropriate behavioral response, namely, whether to approach the target or to avoid it.
This means that grid cells are not just the shared building blocks of the visual system, but rather the core, self-organizing force that generates the fundamental cognitive architecture of the system. This “core” is centered in the MEC, and the “emanc"

In the last few decades, neuroscientists have been forced to understand the brain not only in terms of discrete structures but also in terms of interconnections. The oldest brain areas that are still the most poorly understood are the striosomes, which contain the caudal part of the basal ganglia and the pallidum. The striosomes are characterized by a large number of interconnections. A single striosome may contain more than 100,000 axonal connections. The striosomal axon terminals are interconnected with other regions in the brain. The striosomes are the main targets of pharmacological manipulations, including drugs that modulate the dopamine system. These manipulations often have the side effect of causing movement disorders. Furthermore, dopamine has been shown to be important for motivation, and dopamine-targeting drugs have been used to treat depression (e.g., patients with Parkinson’s disease who have suffered a stroke).

However, we now know that neuronal activity is not the only way information is stored. On several timescales, neuronal activity can be modulated by an adaptive mechanism that does not require sustained activity. This mechanism is capable of encoding information into the overall system and provides sufficient information to access that information later. We can see the effects of this mechanism when we remember certain things in the absence of neuronal activity. In our experiments, we show that memory depends on the balance between neuronal activity and the adaptive mechanism that can store information in that same time. We also find that memory span is not related to the temporal resolution of neuronal activity.

The rise of the digital economy also means that the Economist has shifted from a space of complex macroeconomic analysis to a space of more accurate microeconomic analysis. In a recent paper, the economist Gautam Shahan says, “we are seeing a shift in the way economics is perceived… the economy is no longer seen as a set of aggregates, but rather"

During such discharges, the brain has to integrate at least two complex tasks: maintaining the stability of the conscious experience and suppressing the abnormal brain activity. Thus, the present work investigates the causes of these abnormal discharges in a very specific context: pro-, antiepileptic-drug-induced paroxysms (PEDs) in which the cause is known but the underlying mechanism is not. The holistic view of the problem is complemented by a mechanistic analysis. To this end, we use a very specific mouse model in which we can conditionally ablate NMDA receptors (NMDARs) during the development of the cortex. By precisely localizing the dynamics of the epileptiform activity, we can track back a path from the neuronal network activity to the dysfunctional behavior. We can then quantify the effect of the missing NMDARs on the dynamical functional properties of the network. In this way, we can pinpoint the relevant cellular mechanisms that determine the epileptiform discharges. Further, we can evaluate the effect of antiepileptic"

The Earth has a long history of episodic warming to icehouse conditions punctuated by ice ages. During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the Earth’s climate was entirely icebound. Most of the C was deposited in oceanic sediments and permafrost. Our studies suggest that carbon cycling during the LGM was highly sensitive to the state of the atmosphere and the ocean, much as it is today. During the LGM, the global C isotope excursion was so pronounced that it was observed in the geosphere, ocean, and biosphere. We define an LGM excursion as a rapid change in the C isotopic composition spanning at least a few hundred years. We attribute the LGM excursion to an abrupt increase in the atmospheric CO2 concentration driven by the collapse of West Antarctica’s ice sheet. We suspect that the LGM excursion is well-represented in ocean chemistry and the geosphere, but not the biosphere. We propose to test this hypothesis and its implications for the evolution of Earth’s carbon cycle by comparing"

Conservation certification, often based on the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, has been an effective means of achieving these incentives. However, we ask: Did certification reduce deforestation? We use a comprehensive dataset of RSPO-certified and noncertified oil palm plantations in Indonesia to estimate the impact of certification on deforestation. Certification carried out by the largest palm oil producers had no detectable effect on deforestation. The majority of certified areas contained little forest remaining. Moreover, certification had no causal impact on deforestation within peatlands or active fire detection rates. Our findings imply that the purported benefits of certification are overstated and that widespread certification is insufficient to halt tropical deforestation.

The effect is to reduce the trafficking efficiency of the plant’s vacuole to the plasma membrane and to suppress exocytosis.

This talk will focus on the relationship between sexual selection, sex determination, and the evolution of sexual dimorphism in the strange-looking “strange-looking” cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii. This fish is a model organism for studying sex determination in vertebrates, because the alleles that determine sex are located on the same autosome, which has been maintained by Mendelian segregation. The last common ancestor of all extant Metriaclima genotypes possessed a single sex determination locus, but its alleles were lost during the formation of a second autosome. Consequently, extant Metriaclima genotypes vary in the number of sex determination alleles and number of sex chromosomes. The combined effects of sex determination and sex chromosome number result in modular sexual variation, resulting in dimorphism in morphology and behavior.

We have now shown that the antioxidant enzyme hephaestin protects against photooxidation of the retinal pigment A2E, a primary component of A2E. We were able to demonstrate that the activity of hephaestin could be increased by a reversed-osmosis therapy. This increase in hephaestin activity protected against photooxidation, retinal degeneration, and cone degeneration. We have also been able to successfully show that we can rescue photoreceptor degeneration by restoring hephaestin activity to the retina, thus providing a successful example for the treatment of retinal diseases.
The retina is a remarkable photoreceptor organ, where the action potentials of photoreceptors are converted into signals that travel to the brain via the optic nerve. The photoreceptor cells in the retina are highly susceptible to oxidative stress, as they are exposed to a large number of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are generated during the process of converting light into an action potential. These ROS can be quenched by the antioxidant enzyme he"

In this talk, we show that the study of morphological evolution in the animal kingdom, and more generally the evolution of feeding specializations, can be understood as evolution in the face of multiple “revolvers” (i.e., prey type reversals), where the attack strategy of a predator is determined by the prey type and therefore requires a predator to adapt to one or another of the available prey types. For instance, the transition from jellyfish to fish prey changed the morphology of the tentacles of fish predators from a “stinging” apparatus to a tool. Our analysis of the morphology and prey type of 1845 extant and extinct siphonophores, and their prey specializations, reveals strong association between prey type and morphology, and gives credence to the “revolver” hypothesis. In addition, we identify the morphological innovations that enabled prey transitions, and those that enabled the reversal of multiple prey types with a single predator. We argue that the evolution of prey type reversals is the root of food web diversification.

The present version is the result of a re-analysis of a fossil hand that has been known to paleoanthropologists for more than a century. The fossil comes from the “nose” (the left third metacarpal fragment) of an individual from the Middle Pleistocene Lomekwi 3 locality in Kenya. It was previously identified as Homo erectus by the discoverers, but subsequent analyses by others determined that the hand belonged to Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis, and even Australopithecus afarensis, complicating the interpretation of the fossil. The present study focuses on the third metacarpal styloid process of the fossil hand and shows that it is a feature present in the most recent common ancestor of Homo erectus and Homo sapiens and, thus, unique to humans. The fossil hand is thus the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a suite of features present in the hand of modern humans and regarded as key for independent manipulation of"

The SHMT-dependent metabolic deficiency is unique to DLBCL, highlighting a particular sensitivity of this cancer to this class of drugs. We show that SHMT inhibition is a general strategy for cancer therapy. Overall, the SHMT inhibitor reverses the cancer cells’ dependence upon the folate-dependent pathway that deprived them of growth nutrients, and instead makes them reliant upon the more scarce glycine.

However, this effect has rarely been quantified. Here, we show that deforestation leads to a reduction in fruit and vegetable consumption in rural communities in East Africa by about 11% of average daily intake, or about 100–150 kcal/d. These reductions are not compensated for by large-scale nutritional interventions. We also show that the substantial loss of forest cover over the survey period of about 8% is associated with an increase in diet diversity. These findings highlight the importance of considering the potential for forests to support nutrition security in addition to their environmental benefits.
Response: Deforestation has been shown to have substantial impacts on people’s lives, livelihoods, and environment. While there have been numerous studies of the effects of deforestation on poverty, health, and water resources, the impact on nutrition has been understudied. This study finds that deforestation in East Africa’s forested regions is negatively associated with household fruit and vegetable consumption. The causal link between deforestation and nutrition is supported by the finding that people in deforested areas experience significant decreases in fruit and vegetable"

This talk was given at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in Knoxville, TN, USA on 30 Aug 2017 at 5:00pm, as part of the conference: Human Genetic Adaptation to Environmental Change: The Anthropocene vs. the Anthropogenic.
The Earth has undergone one of the most dramatic changes in its history since the emergence of the first hominins. The Anthropocene is arguably the largest anthropogenic perturbation of the Earth system. Humans have caused unprecedented changes to the environment that have resulted in a changing climate, loss of biodiversity, and hugely changed ecosystem functioning. The complexities of this pervasive impact are reflected in the divisions of the Anthropocene into three distinct epochs: the Anthropocene Epoch, the Holocene Epoch (the last 12,000 yrs of human existence), and the Holocene Acceleration (the recent, rapid acceleration of the Anthropocene).
The Anthropocene Epoch represents the result of the impact of humans on the biosphere, the atmosphere, and the geosphere, but it is not yet well understood how this impact may have affected the evolution of hominins. Indeed,"
